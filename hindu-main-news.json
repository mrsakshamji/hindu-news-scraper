    "content": "The Bombay High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) rejected and refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) petition alleging that Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi violated the petitioner’s rights by making “immature” remarks about Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The petition sought the court to issue directions to the Congress leader that he should read his petition and learn about Savarkar before making “irresponsible” statements.\nThe 125-page petition, filed by Professor Pankaj K. Phadnis, 65, from Mumbai and the founding president of Abhinav Bharat Congress, a public policy think tank, mentioned history and research work by the petitioner on Savarkar.\nThe petitioner said that Mr. Gandhi, in London in March 2023, had tried to paint Savarkar as someone who takes pleasure in the humiliation of Muslims.\nHe further said that Mr. Gandhi tried to portray Savarkar as a coward and in a derogatory reference at a press conference held on March 25, 2023, where he said, “My name is not Savarkar, I am Gandhi and Gandhi does not make apologies to anyone.”\n“Rahul Gandhi is LoP in Lok Sabha and could well become Prime Minister of India in the future. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to take liberties with facts to denigrate respected leaders of freedom struggle and prevent the young from being in a position to fulfil their fundamental duties. The only way to prevent him from causing harm to the nation is by an expert such as the petitioner to step into the box, depose comprehensive facts about Shri Savarkar and allow himself to be cross examined by Rahul Gandhi to establish facts once and for all,” the petitioner said, asking the court to direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of his petition and learn about Savarkar.\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that the Supreme Court had already dismissed a similar petition filed by Mr. Phadnis and said that the court could not direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of the petition and remove his ignorance about Vinayak Savarkar. “In your petition, your prayer is to direct him to personally study and read your petition. How can the court compel him to read your petition? This court cannot issue directions to Rahul Gandhi to study the contents of this petition and remove ignorance about the contribution of Savarkar. We do not know if he will become Prime Minister or not. Do you know that he will become the Prime Minister?“ the Bench noted and disposed of the petition.\nThe court noted that a criminal defamation case had already been filed against Mr. Gandhi by Satyaki Savarkar, grand nephew of Vinayak Savarkar, and that the same was pending before a special MP/MLA Court in Pune."

He also wanted the officials to  create co-working spaces across the 26 district centres for small enterprises coming to the State.\nHe said the proposed Ratan Tata Innovation Hub, which is being developed to foster modern innovation and to promote startups in the State, would be inaugurated soon and asked the officials to take necessary steps to establish regional spoke centres in Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur.\nHe said that in alignment with the Amaravati Quantum Valley, partnerships with companies like TCS, L&T and IBM had already been formed and the officials should finalise essential infrastructure for the partners. Referring to the proposed ‘Drone City’ project at Orvakal in Kurnool district, spanning 400 acres in the coming year, Mr. Lokesh instructed the officials to create an ecosystem to support it.\nHe also wanted wide promotion to the ‘Mana Mitra’ WhatsApp governance services launched by the government. He said that out of the total 702 State services, 535 of them were currently being offered through ‘Mana Mitra’ app. He said steps should be taken to ensure internet connectivity in all the 45,000 government schools and uninterrupted phone connectivity at airports in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajamahendravaram."

    "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) held celebrations in Jammu and Kashmir over the Central Administrative Tribunal’s (CAT) decision to drop Urdu as a mandatory qualification for candidates applying to Naib-Tehsildar posts in the Union Territory.\nA bench of the CAT’s Jammu Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday stayed the operation of provisions in the Jammu and Kashmir Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, which stipulated graduation with knowledge of Urdu as a minimum qualification for the post.\nThe tribunal directed the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) to accept applications from candidates with knowledge of any of the five official languages listed in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the order, the JKSSB on Tuesday deferred the process of inviting applications for the posts.\nUnder the Official Languages Act, 2020, enacted during Central rule, Hindi, Kashmiri, English, Dogri, and Urdu were declared as official languages in Jammu and Kashmir. Prior to the reorganisation of the former State in 2019, Urdu was the sole official language.\nCelebrations were held at Srinagar’s Ghanta Ghar by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, where its president Arun Prabhat welcomed the tribunal’s order. He said the government’s earlier notification to continue with Urdu as a mandatory subject was discriminatory.\n“The notice was anti-Constitution. Our Constitution preamble with Article 14 and 16 are for equal opportunity for all and against any discrimination on the basis of colour, creed or caste. The J&K government notice was discriminatory to four out of five languages declared as official languages here,” Mr. Prabhat said.\nReacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed Ur Rehman Para accused the BJP of politicising the Urdu language and “injecting communal overtones into the discourse around Jammu and Kashmir’s linguistic heritage”.\n“BJP’s attempt to view Urdu through a communal lens marks a dangerous and disgraceful new low in our political discourse in J&K. Urdu is not a symbol of any religion but the throbbing pulse of Jammu & Kashmir’s identity, echoing collective memories and soulful struggles of our people over centuries,” Mr. Para said in a post on social media platform X.\nHe said that Urdu is the language of poets, courts, revenue offices, administration, and everyday life in Jammu and Kashmir. “Even more disturbing is the CAT’s order staying the requirement of basic Urdu knowledge for the Naib Tehsildar exam — a signal that judicial forums too are beginning to cave under political pressure,” he added.\nThe PDP, Mr. Para said, stood for the preservation of the region’s linguistic and cultural identity. “Urdu must be preserved, not just as a language, but as an embodiment of our shared heritage, administrative continuity & cultural essence that binds every region of J&K together.”"

    "content": "Air India will partially resume international flights from August 1, after the “safety pause” necessitated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 fleet following thedeadly crash of AI-171 on June 12. A full restoration of flights across its global network is planned from October 1, the airline said in a press statement.\nThe airline also announced that it will be moving three out of its five weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London’s Gatwick airport to the British capital’s Heathrow airport instead, for a period of two months from August 1.\nBetween July 16 and August 1, the airline will restore seven flights to destinations such as London, Zurich, Tokyo, and Seoul. During the same period, the airline will operate 13 fewer flights to European destinations as compared to its full schedule, and 20 fewer flights to the U.S. and Canada. Destinations in Australia will continue to see four fewer flights. Some services to London and Singapore will remain suspended till September 30.\nThe DGCA had ordered enhanced checks for Air India’s 33 Boeing 787 aircraft, which had led to long delays and cancellations of flights, inviting flak from passengers.\nFollowing the DGCA’s intervention, Air India announced it was curtailing 15% of its internatIonal flights due to disruptions caused due to a combination of factors, including airspace closures over Pakistan and the Middle East. The cut was announced for a period of a month, and later extended until the end of July.\nTuesday’s (July 15, 2025) announcement also follows last week’s interim probe report into the June 12 crash that killed 260 people. The report did not recommend any extra measures for either the aircraft type or its engines.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson told airline employees on an internal platform that all Boeing 787s had been checked since the crash, and were found “fit-to-fly”. Since the interim report found that the lock on the switches that supply fuel to the two engines had moved or “transitioned” before both engines shut down, the airline has also started inspecting the lock feature for the fuel control switches. This exercise has been carried out for 50% of Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet.\nOn Monday (July 14, 2025), the DGCA ordered all airlines with Boeing aircraft to carry out this inspection by July 21."

    "content": "The unemployment rate (UR) among people aged 15 and above has remained the same at 5.6% in May and June 2025, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation here on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nWomen’s participation in labour force, both in urban and rural areas, decreased by one percentage point in June compared with May. The government said there is a “marginal decline” in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men too.\nThe Ministry said the LFPR in current weekly status (CWS) among all persons aged 15 and above was 54.2 % during June this year as compared to 54.8% during May 2025. “The LFPR in rural areas was 56.1% and LFPR in urban areas was 50.4% during June 2025 for persons of the same age group,” the Ministry said. The LFPR for males aged 15 and above in rural and urban areas were respectively 78.1% and 75% during June 2025, and it marked a marginal decline from the corresponding LFPR estimates of 78.3% and 75.1% respectively for rural and urban areas during May 2025.\nFor females, the LFPR for age 15 years and above for rural areas was 35.2% in June 2025. This was 36.9% in May and 38.2% in April. In urban areas, the LFPR for females aged above 15 was 25% in June. It was 25.3% in May. For females of all age groups in both rural and urban areas, the LFPR was 24.5% in June and it was 25.5% in May.\nThe unemployment rate for females and males of all ages above 15 was 5.6%. While for men, the rate remained same as of May, for females there was a decrease in UR by 0.1 percentage point. While the rural unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the urban unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points between May and June.\nThe worker population ratio (WPR) for people of all ages above 15 in both urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 38.7% compared to 39% in May.\nThe Union Government said the marginal decline in LFPR and WPR in June was largely influenced by seasonal agricultural patterns, intense summer heat limiting outdoor physical work, and a shift of some unpaid helpers, particularly from higher-income rural households, towards domestic chores. It said the share of rural female workers in agriculture dropped from 70.2% in May to 69.8% in June, indicating the reduced need for agricultural engagement among women, “perhaps due to a decline in rural inflation”.\nThe Ministry had started releasing monthly figures of employment and unemployment data since April for a better perspective of the situation. “The number of households surveyed was 89,493 (49,335 in rural areas and 40,158 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 3,80,538 (2,17,251 in rural areas and 1,63,287 in urban areas),” the Ministry said."

Mr. Rana has not yet attained the age of 65.\nHowever, Mr. Rana’s counsel, advocate Piyush Sachdeva, submitted that the accused is 64 years and six months old and suffers from medical conditions that warrant special consideration.\nThe NIA informed the court that it has submitted Mr. Rana’s complete medical history to the jail authorities.\nThe matter has been posted for further hearing on July 25.\nExtradited from the United States on April 10, Mr. Rana, 64, is facing trial in connection with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which left more than 166 people dead.\nThe NIA, which is investigating the case, has charged Mr. Rana with conspiring in the attacks along with his associate David Headley. Headley, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, is accused of conducting planning and reconnaissance for the attacks at the behest of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed."

He also favoured reservation in private sector.\n“We must demand political representation and ensure that backward classes will have a proportional voice in all decision-making bodies. Economic opportunities should be expanded through reservation in private sector jobs, government promotions and contracts, financial support and schemes, and access to markets,” he told the delegates at the first meeting of the council here on Tuesday.\n“Awareness campaigns to combat discrimination and ensure social integration, build a strong sense of backward class consciousness, which brings awareness of social reality, strength in numbers and right to equality. This political awakening will fuel aspiration, solidarity and long- term change,” he said, outlining the responsibility for the council, which comprises 24 leaders, including former Chief Ministers, former Ministers and Members of Parliament.\nThe council has been set by the AICC to deliberate and strategise party’s response in the OBC politics across the country and woo back the OBC voters to the party fold.\nMr. Siddaramaiah, a member of the panel, said the Council must become a platform that transforms socio economic and educational caste census from a political debate into constitutional necessity. “It should provide space that ensures backward classes voices shape policy, not just manifestos and a force that mobilises intellectual capital, youth energy and grassroots strength to build leadership emerging from the oppressed classes.” He said the council is not a formality, but “soul of India’s social justice movement... We should remind the country that AHINDA is not a vote bank, but it is the voice of India’s conscience.”\nAttacking the BJP and Sangha Parivar, the Chief Minister said, “They may polarise India through caste division, but we will win back India through social unity and constitutional justice. They treat OBCs as mere symbols, We uplift them as equals.”  At every step, BJP opposed Congress’s social justice efforts not just politically, but ideologically too, undermining equity and resisting OBC empowerment out of discomfort for true backward class advancement, he added.\nAmong those present in the meeting, which will continue its deliberations on Wednesday, were Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanswamy. The council will deliberate on the national caste census, a demand by the Congress and OBC oriented welfare programmes in the country."

The protest is to highlight the DMK government’s failure to implement 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Incidentally, Dr. Ramadoss’s residence is located at Thailapuram in Villupuram district.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, sources close to Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani  said fatigue had set in among the party cadre because of the feud, and this could affect the party’s performance in the 2026 Assembly election.\n“However, the protest against the DMK government would be huge. In 1995, Dr. Ramadoss declared that the then DMK president, M.  Karunanidhi, would be the next Chief Minister and presented him with a yellow shawl at Villupuram. Thirty-five years later, his son Dr. Anbumani  will demand the ouster of the DMK and Karunanidhi’s son, M.K. Stalin, from power for their failure to implement the internal reservation for the Vanniyars,” PMK spokesperson K. Balu said.\nAnother senior PMK leader close to Dr. Ramadoss said he hoped Dr. Anbumani would step back. “Who is going to be the biggest loser if the party’s vote share dwindles and voters switch to other parties? It is going to be Dr. Anbumani who is the future of this party,” he said."

This was 1,579 cusecs higher than Monday’s release of 50,369 cusecs.\nFor the first time during this monsoon, Maharashtra released 5,500 cusecs of water from the Koyna dam into the river Krishna on Tuesday.\nThe dam authorities managing the inflow are trying to balance the impounded quantity of water. The dam recorded an inflow of 25,478 cusecs. The dam has 76.5 tmcft of water or 72% of the full reservoir level.\nOfficials are not impounding water in the Hipparagi barrage. The dam recorded an inflow of 50,460 cusecs and an outflow of 49,810 cusecs. As inflow is high in the Krishna, the river is in a free flow state, hence storage is not done in the monsoon period, officers said in a release.\nThe Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir on the Krishna at Almatti recorded an inflow of 42,577 cusecs and an outflow of 25,000 cusecs.\nThe dam has 97.13 tmcft of water or 78.92% of the full reservoir level.\nThe Narayanpur dam recorded an inflow of 25,000 cusecs and an outflow of 3,000 cusecs. The dam has 30 tmcft of water or 90% of the full capacity."

Besides there would be biannual review meetings, annual reports, and a real-time data dashboard and the field sites will be spread across over 15 forest divisions and protected areas in southern Karnataka.\n“Modern technology will be used to protect elephant corridors and habitats in order to control the increasing elephant-human conflict in the State and protect the crops of farmers on the edge of the forest areas,” said Environment Minister Eshwar Khandre.\nHe further said that elephant-human conflict is common in Hassan and Kodagu, causing loss of life and crop damage, and the department is taking all possible steps to control it."

    "content": "To tap into the expertise of retired scientists, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) — the newly constituted body for funding scientific research — has announced the Prime Minister Professorships.\nEach selected Professor will receive an annual fellowship of ₹30 lakh, along with ₹24 lakh as a research grant for consumables, domestic travel, contingencies, equipment and other expenses. An overhead of ₹1 lakh per annum has also been provisioned.\nThe Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), now subsumed under the ANRF, had earlier administered the SERB Distinguished Fellowship for retired scientists. That scheme offered a research grant of ₹20 lakh per annum and a monthly fellowship of ₹60,000.\nUnlike previous fellowships, the new initiative is also open to overseas scientists, including Non-Resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin, and Overseas Citizens of India. Additionally, professionals from industry and experienced Professors of Practice with a “distinguished record” of research and innovation are eligible to apply.\nA key distinction of the new programme is that recipients must be based at State universities that qualify as “spoke” institutions under Category A of the recently introduced Promoting Advanced and Inclusive Research (PAIR) programme of the ANRF.\nThe PAIR initiative links universities with nascent research ecosystems to top-tier institutions in a mentorship arrangement. Select Central Universities, National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been classified as “spoke” institutions, while institutions ranked 25 or below in the National Institutional Ranking Framework are designated as “hubs”.\nThe selected Professors are expected to relocate, if necessary, to the host university and provide “sustained academic and research support to faculty and students in institutions with emerging research capacity”.\n“Applicants with strong research credentials must be actively involved in research and innovation activities, and demonstrate a strong commitment to mentor faculty at the eligible State universities where research and innovation is still at a nascent stage,” stated a note from the ANRF announcing the fellowship."

    "content": "ThePahalgam terrorist attackof April 22 was carried out to hurt theJammu and Kashmireconomy and to “sow a religious divide”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (SCO-CFM) meeting in China, where other SCO Ministers — including Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar — were present, and called for support to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nOn Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Jaishankar and the other SCO Ministers from Russia, Iran, Belarus and Central Asian states called on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) before proceeding to the SCO meeting in Tianjin by train. The External Affairs Minister also held bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, both of whom he met earlier this month at the BRICS summit in Brazil.\nMr. Jaishankar’s comments came a month after the SCO Defence Ministers’ meeting failed to issue a joint statement following differences over the references to terrorism. While no statement was issued after the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting as well, officials said it was not the practice to do so, as the Foreign Ministers were normally tasked with finalising the agenda for the Summit of leaders on August 31-September 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Tianjin for the summit, which would be his first such visit since the Galwan clashes in 2020.\n“The three evils that SCO was founded to combat were terrorism, separatism and extremism,” Mr. Jaishankar said during his speech at the meeting, where he referred to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 men, mostly tourists, were religiously identified and killed. “It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide”, he added, calling for the SCO to take an “uncompromising position” on the challenge of terrorism, and referring to the UN Security Council resolution issued in April about the attack.\nA press statement issued by the SCO Secretariat said that the members “exchanged views on key areas of SCO cooperation, including political, economic, trade, cultural issues and key international and regional issues”, but did not specifically mention terrorism.\nMr. Jaishankar’s meeting with Mr. Xi came a day after he held bilateral talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he hailed the “continued normalisation” of India-China relations. The Minister said that he had apprised President Xi of recent developments in bilateral relations. “I value the guidance of our leaders in that regard”, he posted on X, referring to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi.\nChinese state media reported that Mr. Xi had told SCO Ministers that the organisation must play a “more proactive role” to ensure stability in a “turbulent and changing international landscape”. Most SCO countries, especially China and India, would be affected if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned law imposing 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil and sanctioned products.\nIn his comments during the SCO-CFM, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mr. Dar did not refer to the issue of terrorism. In a post on social media, Mr. Dar said that he “underscored the importance of upholding international law and implementing relevant UNSC resolutions to resolve longstanding disputes”, at the meeting and that Pakistan sought peace with “all its neighbours”.\nReferring to Afghanistan, which is an SCO observer state but has not been invited since 2021 when the Taliban regime took control of Kabul, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “compulsions of regional stability are buttressed by [India’s] longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people” and called for SCO members to increase development assistance.\nTaking a swipe at Pakistan for closing transit for India-Afghanistan trade, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “lack of assured transit within the SCO space…undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas”, and advocated for the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that runs through Iran."

Usha Raja Nanthini, Professor and Head, Biotechnology Department, has filed 150 separate applications under industrial design for jewellery made with naturally-occurring seeds. The project, funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), aims to train the tribespeople in jewellery-making and help them market their products through a website.\nFive tribal women have come together to establish a company, Tulir, and registered it as a micro, small and medium enterprise. The website is being designed and will sell honey, nutmeg, lichens, benzoin resin (sambrani), and myrobalan (kadukkai), besides jewellery.\nMs. Usha said, “They live in 15-20 hamlets spread over Palani Hills and their population according to the 2011 Census was around 6,000. The children rarely go to school and they live a simple life collecting non-timber forest produce.”\nWhile being on a project to analyse different species of eucalyptus for anti-fungal properties, Ms. Usha and her team came across this habitation. Seeds of eucalyptus, adenanthera, coix and corymbia found in the area were colourful and tough, and they came in various sizes and shapes. “An idea sparked: if we designed jewellery and taught them how to make them, they could sell the products for a living.”\nA few prototypes of the jewellery designs were submitted to the TNSCST in August 2023 and the Council approved the project in January 2024. Then began the tough task of bringing the villagers together. “They were shy and would not entertain outsiders. So, we went through the tribal headman who helped us getting a few people,” Ms. Usha elaborated.\nThe training for the villagers began in January, and she filed the IPR applications through the IPR cell set up by the Council at the university in March. “The idea of setting up these cells is to protect our intellectual property and use them for the benefit of the people,” said S. Vincent, Member Secretary, TNSCST. The council has already set up 40 such cells.\nFifty villagers from Pethuparai Bharathi Annanagar and Pallangi-Kombai hamlets have been trained in jewellery-making, Ms. Usha said. As an aside, members of a women’s self help group from Vadakounji and Vadajaraparai were trained in apiculture (beekeeping), in collaboration with sisters from Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI).\nThe people living in these hamlets largely belonged to the Pazhiyar and Puliyar tribes and have been eking out a living, collecting lichens, soap nuts, gooseberry, honey and other non-timber forest produce and selling them to intermediaries for a pittance, Ms. Usha said. “The place is so remote that the nearest bus stop is 29 kilometres away. Very few have studied till high school,” she added."

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said. The SIR should not be about verifying citizenship, which is the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.\nThe SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar showed the poll panel had admitted to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party, had been saying — that there was a problem with the electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.\n“If Rahul Gandhi is right, then the ECI should give the Congress the data it has been asking for. First, they should accept this, and then adopt the right method to rectify it,” he said.\n“If they have to revise, it should be done with transparency and given proper time. What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

Bindu calling for discussions on marks  processes and development of tools for the same.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the KHSTU said decisions taken without any discussions on such grave issues as normalisation had led to change in candidates’ ranks, putting students under immense stress and resulting in setbacks in courts. This created wrong precedent and allowed mistakes to continue, the association alleged.\nThe government should organise discussions and deliberation instead of taking unilateral decisions so that apprehensions of State higher secondary students’ who were unfairly disadvantaged could be addressed."

After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\nAlso Read |IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw showcases new Aadhaar app for instant authentication\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

He made the appeal during a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday, as part of his two-day visit to the national capital.\nMr. Naidu was accompanied by Union Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, Minister of State for Rural Development Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, TDP Lok Sabha floor leader Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and others.\nThe Chief Minister explained that the project aims to divert 200 tmc ft of surplus floodwaters from the Polavaram reservoir to the Banakacherla regulator in Kurnool district. This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema. Later, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Managing Director Vikas Kumar also called on the Chief Minister and held discussions on possible collaboration for metro rail projects in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada."

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

The belief that these cases are occurring only in Hassan is incorrect.”\nInstead of panicking, people should focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, getting adequate sleep, and exercising regularly. “Only those having symptoms of heart-related illness should go for a medical check-up. Do not rush to hospitals without a reason,” Dr. Patil said.\nThe Minister further noted that lifestyle changes after COVID-19 have led to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. “Dietary habits have changed, and stress levels have increased. We are studying the reasons behind the rise in deaths among the youth,” he said."

    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”\nSome auto aggregators have already started displaying the revised minimum fare of ₹36. A leading aggregator has adopted the new fare even before its official implementation on August 1."

Yet, Mr. Vikramarka had made ‘false statements’ which are ‘defamatory in nature’ with a ‘preconceived motive to tarnish the fame and reputation’ of the BJP leader, said the notice.\nCondemning the Deputy CM’s statements, the notice said it has caused ‘irreversible’ damage to the Telangana BJP president’s reputation.

Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

A look at such symbols with the size in which they are displayed on ballot papers/EVM machines clearly show the similarities of the free symbols with the BRS symbol of car.\nIt could be clearly understood as to how candidates getting those symbols had been cutting into BRS votes in the past, affecting the prospects of BRS candidates.

To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933.

Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered.

We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre-matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

    "content": "The police have arrested four people, including three habitual offenders from Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly making a ransom call to a city businessman posing as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi last week.\nThe suspects have been identified as Rafiq, a Bengaluru businessman, and Amith, Vansh Sachdev, and Sheeshpal Singh, alias Monty, all from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.\nOn July 8, one of the suspects from U.P. called a Bengaluru businessman claiming to be Bishnoi, and threatened to kidnap his son and demanded ₹1 crore. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

    "content": "After a brief hiatus, the southwest monsoon conditions have strengthened across the State with the intensification of monsoon flow of wind from the Arabian Sea. North and central Kerala will have some intense spells of rain compared to the rest of State for the next week, with spillover rain even benefitting parts of south Kerala.\nThe peak monsoon feature offshore trough, which was in a feeble condition, has now turned into active mode with the trough extending from the Gujarat coast to the south Kerala coast on Tuesday. The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe current spell is likely to bridge the shortfall of July rain over the State, with the north half of Kerala having the lion’s share of rain, including parts of central Kerala. However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

Ramchander Rao for his remarks on the inclusion of Muslims in the Backward Classes (BC) category in the State. He claimed that poor Muslims were first included in the BC category during the British period, adding that Muslims were part of the BCs even in BJP-ruled states.\nSpeaking to the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Tuesday, the Congress MP advised Mr. Ramchander Rao to gain subject knowledge before making such comments. “Ramchander Rao lacks substance, that’s why he is resorting to babbling. It would be better if he gained knowledge on the subject before commenting,” he said.\nMr. Kiran Kumar also alleged that the BJP was attempting to divide people along religious and caste lines. “I hope that at least Ramchander Rao should not do the same thing,” he said, appealing to the BJP for cooperation in the State’s development. He reiterated the Congress government’s commitment to implementing 42% reservations for BCs."

Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment. Later that day, he took the drastic step.\nRamakanth was shifted to a private hospital in Bahadurpally, where he was declared dead.

Anil Kumar from using his official vehicle on Tuesday.\nDr. Kunnummal has issued instructions to Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen, who has been given additional charge of Registrar, and the security wing to implement the order. However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

However, he was informed only a couple of days before the event. By then, his visit to Indi in Vijayapura was already scheduled.\n“The BJP leaders thought that the Chief Minister would speak about the tax collection and the dues from the Centre. To avoid embarrassment, they did not invite him in advance. MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi planned and executed the programme,” he remarked.\nHe maintained that the State government had been taking up many development works for the State, including the Sharavati Pumped Storage project. “It intends to generate 2,000 MW of power. The Central government has also given its consent for the project, which is being executed at a cost of ₹8,644 crore,” he said.\nRegarding the opposition to the project, Mr. Krishna said that the opposition from environmentalists was expected. However, the project would not disturb the local habitats to a large extent. A few families, which would be affected, had been convinced. The government would consider their demands, including jobs, with the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, he added."

    "content": "The rulingNational Conference (NC)on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) upped the ante against Jammu and Kashmir Governor Manoj Sinha, with Chief MinisterOmar Abdullahsaying he “suffered silently for the past eight months”.\n“We suffered in silence for the past eight months but did not complain. It’s for what happened yesterday that you (people) came to know about our reality. But don’t misconstrue our decency for weakness. We don’t talk loudly, threaten or resort togundagardi(hooliganism) but that does not mean we are weak. My strength is my people. I will always safeguard my strength,” Mr. Abdullah, who was addressing a function at the Jhelum Valley Medical College in Srinagar, said.\nMr. Abdullah was referring to the L-G administration’s security measures to stop the Chief Minister and the Ministers from visiting the graveyard where 22 civilians, killed during the 1931 uprising against the Dogra ruler, are buried. On July 14, there were dramatic images where Mr. Abdullah was seen climbing a wall to reach the graveyard and a police officer pushing him in a bid to stop him from paying tributes.\n“They (administration) tried their best to raise barricades on July 14. No barricade will push us away from our goal. We will work towards realising the dignity and dreams of people of Kashmir. There will be no sell out with the dreams of our people. It’s no favour we are ruling Jammu and Kashmir. It’s because of Allah and our people we are here today,” Mr. Abdullah said.\nIt’s for the first time since Mr. Abdullah won elections in October 2024 after a prolonged Central rule that he upped the ante to this high pitch against L-G Mr. Sinha, who retains the powers to transfer employees, both State and Central services, and spearhead the security forces in the union territory.\nThe dramatic images of Mr. Abdullah being heckled and disallowed to reach the graveyard in Srinagar evoked sharp reactions from national leaders, includingTamil NaduChief Minister M.K. Stalin,West BengalChief Minister Mamata Banerjee,Samajwadi Partypresident Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav.\n“At a time when there is a growing demand for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood, the current events unfolding there are a grim reminder of how far things have deteriorated. If this can happen in Kashmir, it can happen anywhere, to any elected representative of the people. Every democratic voice must unequivocally condemn this,” Mr. Stalin said in a post on X.\nMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) described the actions against the sitting Chief Minister as “an insult to democracy”.\n“This land saw countless sacrifices for freedom and the Constitution. Under the same Constitution, Mr. Abdullah’s government was elected by the people. Any insult to Mr. Abdullah is an insult to democracy, an insult to India’s democracy, and an insult to the people who gave us their mandate,” said Mr. Choudhary.\nMr. Choudhary said any insult or humiliation of our leader would not be tolerated. “We will not stay silent. What happened yesterday whether people speak up about it or not is an insult to every Indian who cast their vote,” he added.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister said one day the L-G, like taking responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack, might even say that what happened with OmarSahibwas wrong. “The police are under his control and acted unjustly. He (L-G) owes an apology for what happened yesterday,” he added.\nReferring to Mr. Sinha’s recent statement accepting responsibility for the security lapse in the Pahalgam terror attack, Mr. Abdullah said, “Someone has to be held responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack and now that the security lapses have been accepted.”"

    "content": "A sense of fear gripped Shalivahana Nagar, a residential colony in Malakpet here after gunfire shattered the early morning calm on Tuesday. The incident was reported around 7:20 a.m., just outside Shalivahana Nagar Park, where Communist Party of India (CPI) State Council member Chandu Naik, 47, was shot dead during morning walk.\nThe park, located at the end of a wide lane flanked by swanky independent houses and residential complexes, akiranastore, an Urban Primary Health Centre and many trees, turned into a scene of panic as the attackers allegedly fired five rounds at Naik from close range before fleeing in a car.\nOutside the park’s ‘West Gate’, police from the South East Zone cordoned off an area roughly the size of a human body, with a white chalk outlining the boundaries of the body. At its centre lay a large bloodstain.\nVijay Kumar (name changed on request), a local resident whose house faces the park, said: “I heard what sounded like firecrackers. I rushed out immediately and saw four men escaping in a white car after shooting Naik multiple times. They stood over him briefly to confirm he was dead, then drove away via the four-way junction to the left of the park.”\nThe road in front of the park, to Kumar’s residence, is wide enough for three SUVs to pass at a time. It was the same stretch the assailants used to speed away in their getaway vehicle, a hatchback, that they had rented from a nearby place.\nChandu Naik.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Arrangement\nKumar’s two children, aged 12 and 13, were coming downstairs to leave for school when the shots rang out. “They were terrified and ran back inside. It took some time to calm them down. I eventually had to escort them to their school van myself,” he added.\nHe also pointed out that Naik’s body remained at the spot for over half an hour before the police arrived. Despite the Urban Primary Health Centre being just a few steps away, the body was not moved.\nAnother resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “At first, we thought it was just kids shooting videos in the park again. But the gunshots continued. Minutes later, we saw a body in a pool of blood.” Like many others in the locality, he expressed concern for his safety and said he no longer felt secure taking his morning walk.\nAnil (name changed), who owns a kirana store about 100 metres from the site, said he opened his shop shortly after the attack. “People kept coming in, asking what the sounds were and what had happened. The whole area was in a state of shock,” he said.\nPolice officers at the crime scene.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                NAGARA GOPAL\nBy mid-morning, the lane was swarming with police patrol vehicles, and officers clad in khaki moved briskly across the colony, speaking to residents and scouring the area for clues. The park, which bustles with activity until 10 a.m., was deserted. Access was blocked as police launched an investigation into the shooting.\nMalakpet ACP K.Subba Rami Reddy stated that Naik had been accompanied to the park by his wife and daughter, who had left shortly before the attack. “Around 7.20 a.m., as Naik was walking back towards his car, four men got out of another vehicle and attacked him. One threw chilli powder into his eyes while the others shot him from point-blank range using a country-made pistol,” Mr.Reddy said."

Some ₹3.08 crore was sanctioned to the Karnataka Gramin Bank to develop connectivity infrastructure in underserved areas.\nNABARD released a booklet titled ‘Success Stories of FPOs in Karnataka’, which documented the inspiring journeys of farmer-producer organisations across the State. The booklet showcases how small and marginal farmers have successfully come together to access markets, add value to their produce, embrace digital platforms, and establish inclusive and resilient business models.\nNABARD has played a key role in supporting sustainable agriculture, developing secondary agriculture, creating value addition and in the development of rural infrastructure in Karnataka, acknowledged Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, she urged farmers in the State to make full use of NABARD’s schemes and become entrepreneurs.\nElaborating on value addition, the Chief Secretary said, instead of selling mangoes as raw produce, farmers should process them into various products and sell them. Recently, the price of Totapuri mango variety crashed, and if mango farmers set up small processing units in their villages, they would be able to earn income round the year, she said."

    "content": "Opposition leaders in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday came out in support of a teacher from Bareilly, who was booked under Section 353 (2) (making statements containing false information, rumour or alarming news) of the BNS for his poem, parts of which referred to the Kanwar Yatra.\nThe FIR against Rajneesh Gangwar, a teacher at Bareilly’s MGM Inter College, was registered on July 13, based on a complaint by an outfit named Kanwar Seva Samiti.\nThe video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, which recently went viral on social media, contains a portion where he says, “Kanwar leke mat jana, tum gyan ka deep jalana, manavta ke seva karke tum sachche manav ban jaana[Don’t get pots of holy water from the Ganga, light the lamp of knowledge, become a true human by serving humanity].”\nSharing the video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, former U.P. Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X in Hindi, “The greatest religion is that which leads us on the path of humanity.”\nAttacking the ruling BJP, Congress leader Anil Yadav said that while the Constitution promotes scientific thinking, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry among citizens, which Mr. Gangwar was trying to promote through his verse, elements in the State government aim to encourage “superstition and irrationality and suppress voices”.\nMeanwhile, in a purported video on Tuesday, Mr. Gangwar said his poem was meant to educate students, and his intention was not to express negative sentiments about the yatra. “If you listen to the whole poem, it was recited to educate children and tell them about incidents happening related tokanwariyas.”\nHe also dared the police to take action against senior National Democratic Alliance(NDA)leader and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president O.P. Rajbhar over his purported comments from 2021: “No one can become a doctor or an engineer from among thekanwariyas. Kanwar Yatra is meant only for unemployed people.” At the time, Mr. Rajbhar, an MLA from Zahoorabad, was part of the Opposition. He joined the ruling NDA in 2023 and is currently a Minister in the State Cabinet."

It called reports on media and commentary on social media as “hasty”.\n“A preliminary report is merely the means of communication used for the prompt dissemination of data obtained during the early stages of the investigation and only contains factual information and an indication of the progress of the investigation,” the statement added.\nAmid demands from pilot bodies for allowing them observer status during the ongoing probe, IFALPA said it was “committed” to supporting the AAIB."

Appadurai, Head of Department, Department of Dental Surgery, Vellore Medical College Hospital; K. Baby John, Dean, Vinayaka Mission Hospital (Salem); and B. Vijay, principal, RVS Dental College and Hospital (Coimbatore).\nThe inspection was led by Mr. Appadurai and the other two were members of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Council. “The dental clinic has remained closed since it was sealed from May 31 on orders of Tirupattur Collector K. Siva Soundaravalli. Action against the clinic will be taken based on the report of the team,”, V. Gnana Meenakshi, Joint Director of Health Services (JDHS), Tirupattur, toldThe Hindu.\nThe team inspected various sections in the clinic. The hour-long inspection also involved interaction with doctors, nurses, and other staff, who worked in the clinic before its closure. As the team completed the inspection, health authorities closed and sealed the facility.\nHealth officials said that closure of the clinic comes in the wake of a study done jointly by CMC Vellore, ICMR-NIE and Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health, which stated that an unsterile surgical instrument was used to open a saline bottle at the clinic. Reuse of the bottle’s contents had led to at least 10 people contracting neuro melioidosis — a bacterial infection of the brain — which allegedly led to the death of eight patients, who got treated there, the study said."

A magistrate’s court had found them guilty and handed down the sentence on June 18.\nThe convicts also included an unsuccessful Congress candidate in the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election. All of them convicted under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), and 341 (wrongful restraint) of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment each, along with the imposition of fine of ₹3,200 each.\nAmong the convicts, Abhishek Chaudhary contested the 2023 Assembly election as a Congress candidate from Jaipur’s Jhotwara constituency and lost. The other convicts in the case were Rajesh Meena, Ravi Kirad, Wasim Khan, Dron Yadav, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Vidyadhar Meel.\nAdditional Sessions Judge Prem Ratan Ojha accepted the contention of the appellants that they would be deprived of their legal rights if the sentence was not suspended. The court granted relief to the convicts and posted the case for further hearing on August 26.\nThe Assembly membership of both Mr. Bhakar and Mr. Yadav remains unaffected following the sentencing, as a legislator can be disqualified only on being convicted for an offence with a two-year sentence or more, as per Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."

So, there is great potential for innovation, he observed after inaugurating IBM’s Ecosystem Incubation Center (EIC) at Infopark Kochi. The EIC has been conceived as a strategic space designed to accelerate innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration across start-ups, enterprises, and academia, while serving as a hub for early-stage ventures, skill-building, and co-innovation.\nEmphasising the need for a “clear understanding and consultation” ahead of introducing AI in the government’s daily operations, Mr. Rajeeve said its implementation would not compromise on privacy and data security. “This kind of a change will be very beneficial to the people,” he pointed out.\nThe Minister recalled that the government had prepared a draft proposal called ‘Industry 4.0’ for the introduction of AI in the industrial sector. “We will take a decision on this after receiving feedback from the industry,” he added.\nKerala has 16 colleges that have made it to the top 100 colleges in the country. Three universities are in the top 20, the Minister pointed out. Mr. Rajeeve also inaugurated a symposium ‘GenAI and Agentic AI for start-ups, academia, and enterprises’.\nIBM Software senior vice president Dinesh Nirmal said Kerala enjoyed an advantage in the availability of skills and operational excellence. The State’s transport connectivity is “excellent” compared to other places, he said, noting that the incubation centre was started to “fully utilise the excellent IT ecosystem” in Kerala.\n“By collaborating with organisations such as the Kerala Startup Mission, Infopark, Technopark, and the academia, we aim to scale the development of impactful software solutions to solve our clients’ hybrid cloud and AI needs,” he added.\nPrincipal Secretary (Industries) A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, KSIDC Managing Director Mir Mohammed Ali, IBM India vice president Vishal Chahal, Infopark CEO Susanth Kurunthil, and representatives of industry associations attended the event."

Hatred in politics spares no one.

    "content": "Though Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in April that ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) had been restored, there has been no attempt by either party to conceal the apparent contradictions between them.\nAt a press conference held jointly with the AIADMK general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Shah said, “We will fight the elections under the leadership of Edappadiji.” He also added that there would be a “coalition government” in the event of a victory. The AIADMK did not react positively to this announcement. It is not just the AIADMK; even the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has always been averse to the idea of a coalition government in Tamil Nadu.\nIn the 1980 Assembly elections, the DMK-Congress combine failed to capture power. The constituents of the coalition contested an equal number of seats. After a round of wrangling with the DMK, the Congress finally agreed that the then DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate. However, the coalition did not click at the hustings. Instead, the AIADMK, which won only two seats in the Lok Sabha elections earlier that year and subsequently lost power in Tamil Nadu, staged a spectacular comeback in the Assembly polls.\nIn 2001, when the AIADMK contested the Assembly elections from 141 seats — the lowest number it has ever contested — in view of coalition compulsion, political circles discussed whether the party would be able to obtain a simple majority of its own. The AIADMK needed to secure 118 seats in the House of 234. The AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa never favoured the concept of sharing power in the State. However, the party had no reason to worry as it won 132 seats.\nIn 2006, the DMK fell short of a simple majority as it won only 96 seats. Yet, it refused to share power with its allies. Karunanidhi and the then Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, shared such a good rapport that the DMK patriarch managed to form the government without sharing power with the Congress.\nAfter making that comment in April, Mr. Shah reiterated his position in many interviews to the media. However, the AIADMK is clearly not on the same page. Alluding to the Union Minister’s stand, AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan said that the concept of a coalition government would “never ever” find acceptance among the people of the State. Similarly, Mr. Palaniswami, who launched a State-wide tour from July 7 in the run-up to the 2026 Assembly elections, has been asserting that the AIADMK will form the government after gaining a majority on its own. When asked to comment on Mr. Shah’s position, he said he interpreted them as an endorsement of single-party rule in the State. Despite the conflicting views of the two parties, the BJP State president, Nainar Nagendran, and Union Minister of State L. Murugan participated in Mr. Palaniswami’s campaign launch.\nIn one interview, Mr. Shah said that the nominee for the post of Chief Minister would be from the AIADMK; he did not mention Mr. Palaniswami’s name. This did not go unnoticed in the DMK circles. The party sought to corner the AIADMK general secretary and saw Mr. Shah’s statement as a lack of confidence in Mr. Palaniswami’s leadership qualities. Eventually, it was left to Mr. Nagendran to clarify that the AIADMK leader would head the government.\nYet, speculation is rife that the Union Minister may have in mind former Municipal Administration Minister in Coimbatore, S.P. Velumani. About three weeks ago, the AIADMK strongman shared the stage with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior BJP leaders at the birth centenary celebration of the pontiff of Perur Mutt, Shanthalinga Ramasamy Adigalar. He later explained that he attended the event, which he termed as “apolitical”, only as a local legislator. Prior to the announcement on the tie up between the two parties, there were reports of differences of opinion between the AIADMK chief and some of his senior colleagues, including Mr. Velumani.\nAs the debate over the nature of government could spoil the narrative for the Opposition parties, it would be in the interest of the alliance to sort out the issue soon. Having said that, it remains inexplicable that this debate is even raging given that the composition of different alliances has not even been finalised yet."

    "content": "Jiten Gohain is the head of one of 218 families evicted during a drive the authorities in Assam’s Lakhimpur district carried out on July 3 to reclaim 78 acres of Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) land across four locations.\nOn July 8, the district’s Sub-Divisional Land Advisory Committee approved the allotment of 1.5 kathas (4,320 sq. ft) of land each to 21 families evicted, in one of the fastest such exercises. Among them were 12 belonging to the Ahom community, which is seeking Scheduled Tribe status, to which Mr. Gohain belongs.\nDistrict Commissioner Pronab Jit Kakoty said the eviction drive was conducted following “due process”. He said the affected families, which failed to produce land ownership documents, were served notices on June 29.\n“I had a larger plot from where we were evicted, but the government has at least provided some space,” Mr. Gohain said.\nAbul Hasan Sheikh, one of some 200-odd Bengali-speaking Muslim families evicted from Lakhimpur, is not sure if the government would be equally “generous” to provide him an alternative plot. He is originally a resident of western Assam’s South Salmara-Mankachar district along the border with Bangladesh.\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma named him and at least a dozen others from faraway districts – most of them Muslim-majority – to underline the alleged “agenda of demographic invasion by strategically occupying lands in areas dominated by indigenous communities”.\n“An analysis has revealed that the families evicted from Lakhimpur included 76 from Barpeta, 63 from Nagaon, seven from Goalpara, and two from South Salmara-Mankachar. Why should someone from South Salmara go to Lakhimpur instead of going to West Bengal, about 50 km away?” Mr. Sarma told reporters on Tuesday.\nThe Chief Minister said more than 50,000 people have been evicted from “protected areas, wetlands, VGR and PGR (Professional Grazing Land), government khas (land owned by the government that has not been settled) and wasteland, and those belonging tosatras (Vaishnav monasteries) andnamghars (prayer halls)” over the past few weeks.\nAccording to the State’s Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation of 1986, the Land Policy of 1989, and a 2011 Supreme Court judgment mandate protection of government and village common lands. It also cites the violation of the Assam Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act of 2010 as a punishable offence.\nAfter the BJP came to power in Assam in May 2016, the first eviction drive was carried out in three fringe villages of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. Two persons, including a minor girl, were killed during the eviction based on a Gauhati High Court order in September 2016.\n“Most of those evicted are listed as voters in places from where they came. We have asked the authorities from where they were evicted to delete their names from the electoral rolls to eliminate duplicate names,” Mr. Sarma said.\nCiting the case of the 12 Ahom families, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union has demanded rehabilitation for the evicted Muslim families. It claimed many people had lands they were evicted from before these were declared as reserve forests.\nThe Opposition parties have criticised the eviction drive for disproportionately targeting the minority communities. “The Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission should take note of the eviction during the court holidays in Assam to target poor Muslims. The government must first provide adequate rehabilitation and only then undertake eviction,” All India United Democratic Front MLA Rafiqul Islam said.\n“The BJP government has been projecting the evicted people as Bangladeshi. The government provided a compensation package of ₹14.72 crore to 332 families evicted from Kaziranga. People evicted [in 2021] for the Gorukhuti project [Darrang district] were compensated and given land in the Dalgaon area. Why is the government doing so if these people are Bangladeshi?” Congress leader and advocate Aman Wadud said.\nOthers pointed out that the Dhubri district administration has asked 1,400 families displaced from Chapar town, reportedly to make space for a thermal power plant by the Adani Group, to relocate to a sandbar in the middle of the Brahmaputra river.\n“The eviction is being carried out for two reasons. Firstly, they want to clear land for corporate houses. Secondly, evicting minorities paves the way for the politics of polarisation... so that the Hindu voters back the BJP, especially in eastern Assam, where it is facing challenges,” Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi said.\nLurinjyoti Gogoi, the chief of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), said eviction drives are a form of the tried-and-tested ploy of weaponising the “Bangladeshi issue” before the poll.\nThe Assembly poll in Assam is due by May 2026.\n“The Chief Minister claims he is doing everything for the indigenous people. In reality, more tribal families have been evicted than the Muslims. In Karbi Anglong, 20,000 Adivasi, Karbi, and Naga families have been evicted to hand over 18,000 bighas of land to the Reliance Group,” the AJP leader claimed. In Assam, one bigha is equivalent to 14,400 sq. ft.\nHe also cited 9,000 bighas of land “to be handed over to the Adani Group” in Dima Hasao district, 45 bighas “taken away” from the Adivasis for a hotel project near Kaziranga, and 75 bighas for a Patanjali project in the Golaghat district. “It is evident why the government is on a land acquisition spree. Of the 49,000 bighas cleared, only 6,000 bighas were under the occupation of the religious minorities,” the AJP leader said."

    "content": "The history section of the newly introduced Class 8 social science textbook by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for students in the current 2025-26 academic year portrays Mughal rulers, especially Babur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb, as “intellectuals” who also “plundered” the Indian population.\nThe second chapter of the textbook, titled ‘Reshaping India’s Political Map in Theme B - Tapestry of the Past’ includes references from theBaburnama, Babur’s autobiography, and describes him as cultured, intellectually curious, and having a keen appreciation of architecture, poetry, flora, and fauna. The textbook also goes on to say that Babur was a ruthless conqueror, slaughtering populations, enslaving women and children, and taking pride in erecting “towers of skulls” in plundered cities.\nAkbar’s reign is described as a blend of “brutality and tolerance”, and that during the seizure of the Chittor fort, Akbar, then 25 years old, ordered the massacre of 30,000 civilians, and the enslavement of women and children, the new textbook states. Akbar’s message is also quote in the textbook: “We have succeeded in occupying a number of forts and towns belonging to infidels and have established Islam there. With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” The textbook says Akbar leaned towards peace in the later years of his reign.\nThe new textbook also states that Aurangzeb issuedfarmansor edicts to demolish schools and temples. “Temples at Banaras, Mathura, Somnath among many others were destroyed, as well as Jain temples and Sikh gurdwaras,” the new textbook says. It also speaks of the persecution of Sufis and Zoroastrians at the hands of the Mughals.\nBabur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb have not been described in such detail in the older NCERT textbook’s chapter on the Mughals, which appeared in the Class 7 History book (‘Our Pasts II’).\nMichel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science. File\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu\n“Indian history cannot be cannot sanitised and presented as a smooth, happy development throughout. There were bright periods but also dark periods where people suffered, so we have given note on the darker chapters of history, and also given a disclaimer that no one today should be regarded as responsible for whatever happened in the past,” Michel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science, toldThe Hindu.\n“You cannot understand them (the Mughal emperors) unless you go into the complexities of their personalities. Akbar himself admits he was brutal in his younger days. We are not demonising Akbar or Aurangzeb, but we have to show these rulers had their limitations and committed cruel deeds,” Mr. Danino said.\nBecause Part One of the earlier released new Class 7 Social Science textbook in April culminated in the pre-Delhi Sultanate era of the 6th century, there was an element of uncertainty on how the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era would find their place in the newly revamped textbooks. While earlier a Class 7 student would have learnt about the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal history, these sections have now been shifted to the first part of the newly released Class 8 textbooks, available in bookstores mid-July onward.\nThe first part of the new Class 8 Social Science textbook, which has combined History, Geography, Civics, and Economics into one title,Exploring Society: India and Beyond, will serve as a resource for the first six months of the academic year for Class 8, NCERT officials clarified. “Part Two textbooks for both Classes 7 and 8 for Social Science will be released in October later this year. Part Two textbooks are currently under development,” officials said.\nThe new Class 8 textbook also has a section on heroic resistance to the Mughals, including on the Jat peasants who managed to kill a Mughal officer; the Bhil, Gond, Santhal and Koch tribal communities, who fought to protect their territories; and Rani Durgavati of one of the Gond kingdoms, who fought against Akbar’s army. Sections have also been added on the escape of Mewar’s ruler Maharana Pratap, and the resistance of the Ahoms to Aurangzeb’s army in northeastern India."

So there's all kinds of weapons, but we have not discussed in detail yesterday with the president.

Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to release water from the expanded Phase-1 canal of the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project on July 17, at the Malyala Pumping Station of Nandikotkur mandal in Nandyal district.\nThe expansion of HNSS Phase-1 canal had been completed, increasing its capacity from 2,200 cusecs to 3,850 cusecs, an official press release said here on Tuesday.\nThis canal was expected to facilitate the transfer of water up to the Jeedipalli Reservoir and beyond, with the government targeting the Chittoor and Punganur branch canals by the end of this month.\nThe expansion, taken up at a cost of ₹696 crore, would enable an additional 1,600 cusecs of water to be carried through the canal network. Officials said the project aimed at addressing the drinking water and irrigation needs of Rayalaseema, covering parts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Chittoor, and Kadapa districts.\nWater from the canal would benefit 6 lakh acres and provide drinking water to approximately 33 lakh people once Phase-1 and Phase-2 become fully operational. Under Phase-1, around 2,906 acres in Nandyal, 77,094 acres in Kurnool, and 1.18 lakh acres in Anantapur were set to receive irrigation supply. Phase-2 was projected to serve 2.27 lakh acres in Anantapur, 37,500 acres in Kadapa, and 1.40 lakh acres in Chittoor.\nThe release also mentioned that the government mobilised efforts to complete 216-km of canal works from Malyala to Jeedipalli, and planned to refill local reservoirs like Jeedipalli, Krishnagiri, Pathikonda, and Gajuladinne. The improved canal capacity was expected to allow full utilisation of the project’s 40 tmc ft water allocation this year — reportedly for the first time in over a decade.\nThe Water Resources Department executed the works over a 100-day period beginning in April 2025. The government plans to complete the remaining Phase-2 works by this month-end and supply water to the tail-end ayacut areas in Punganur and Kuppam.\nA total expenditure of ₹3,890 crore had been earmarked for Phases 1 and 2 of the HNSS project, the release added."

It suggested to enforce statutory timelines and penalties for inaction or misconduct by EROs or District Election Officers (DEOs), empower the State election watch committees to function with observer status during roll revision, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to prevent local influence or partisan misuse and appoint a State-level Ombudsman under ECI to handle unresolved political grievances related to the electoral rolls.\nIt has also suggested the ECI to conduct targeted re-enrollment campaigns for migrant workers, tribal groups, elderly people, and homeless citizens, and permit temporary address declarations with basic documentation to prevent disenfranchisement of mobile populations."

He said the government had drafted officials of various departments to receive petitions when only a few months were left for the election. The scheme was aimed at deceiving the electorate into voting for the ruling DMK. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had been concerned only about his family since he entered office in 2021 and launched the scheme now. “Why didn’t he reach out to the people for so long,” he asked.\nUngaludan Stalinwas similar to the exercise undertaken by Mr. Stalin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the run-up to the 2021 election. What was the need for launching a similar exercise when he and his party men had already received petitions. It was nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the people, Mr. Palaniswami said. Furthermore, the initiative was nothing new. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had drafted all revenue officials to receive petitions from the people at their doorsteps. It had been copied and launched as a new scheme to get publicity, he said.\nMr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK government had failed in maintaining law and order. There was no safety for the people. Murders, murders for gain, dacoity, and crimes against women and children were the order of the day. Since the DMK assumed office in 2021, the State had witnessed more than 7,700 murders. Mineral wealth was being looted by the government. A farmer was murdered and another sustained grievous injuries in an assault by the sand mafia in the Manmangalam taluk of Karur district on July 13, he alleged, urging the people to vote out the DMK.\nEarlier, interacting with farmers and representatives of farmers’ associations in Ariyalur district, he said the AIADMK government had provided three-phase power supply to the farmers throughout the day. However, it was stopped by the DMK government. The DMK government had discontinued several other schemes meant for helping the farmers improve productivity. The AIADMK government had provided subsidies to the farmers to buy modern agricultural machines. To prevent malpractices, applications were received online for the selection of beneficiaries. This practice had been halted and only hand-picked farmers were being given the benefits. All the schemes introduced by the AIADMK government for the benefit of farmers would be revived once the party returned to power, he said."

Everyone respected him a lot,\" the villager added.\nAnother local Gurpreet Singh said after the vehicle struck Fauja Singh, he was immediately rushed to hospital.\n\"We took him to hospital... The vehicle which struck him could be an SUV. He suffered injuries to head and other parts of body. Entire village has plunged into sadness after his demise. Our village got global recognition due to him,\" Mr. Gurpreet said.\nOn Tuesday, the Jalandhar police said that efforts are on to trace the erring driver, who had fled after the incident.\nThe last rites of Singh are likely to be conducted after a couple of days, a family member toldPTIon Tuesday.\n\"We have many relatives living abroad including in the U.K. and Canada. So, it may take some time before they reach,\" he said.\nHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said the news of Fauza Singh's demise is deeply saddening.\n\"Living a healthy lifestyle and reaching the age of 114, which seems impossible in today's era, he made possible,\" said Mr. Saini in a post in Hindi on X.\n\"His indomitable energy and message of a healthy lifestyle are a source of inspiration for us all.

Punjab and the world salute his incredible life,\" Bajwa posted on X.\nIn a post on X, Punjab Congress chief Warring wrote, \"Saddened over the untimely death of our legend #FaujaSingh Ji. He was an example of grit, determination and perseverance running marathons well past 100 years.\" \"More shocking is that he fell victim to a hit-and-run incident.

He became the first centenarian to complete a marathon, earning multiple records while participating in international events.\nHe went on to run marathons, including the famed ones in London, New York and Hong Kong, and inspire awe for clocking some brilliant timings for a 90-plus man born with weak legs.\nAmong the most memorable of his runs was in 2011 when he turned 100. The invitational meet in Toronto was named in his honour and he broke several world records for his age group.\nThe frail man, who weathered many personal storms with his resilience and \"nonchalance\", had spent a better part of his running career in Britain and returned to his roots just about three years ago after retiring.\nLast year, Singh, in a symbolic gesture, joined Punjab Governor Gulab Chand Kataria in a walkathon to spread awareness against drug abuse."

This news is extremely saddening,” she said, adding that Upendrakishore was a pillar of Bengal’s Renaissance.\nAccording to the Bangladesh Department of Archaeology, the house was built more than a century ago. After the partition of 1947, the property came under government ownership. Media reports in Bangladesh pointed out that the house has been left abandoned for ten years and a “Shishu Academy’ will be constructed in the place of the building.\nLast month, a political row erupted in West Bengal over theattack on an ancestral house of Rabindranath Tagoreat Sirajganj in Bangladesh, with both the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) highlighting the issue.\nWest Bengal Chief Minister on June 12 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him “take up the matter very strongly with the neighbouring country’s government, so that no stone is left unturned to swiftly bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous and mindless act”."

    "content": "The seemingly impeccably designed Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE), which was once the State’s single window system of intake of students to professional courses like engineering, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary, agriculture and other allied ones, was not bereft of controversies and legal wrangles.\nIn 2004, Anna University, the nodal agency which was tasked with conducting the TNPCEE on behalf of the State government since its inception in 1984, decided to not value 22 questions in different subjects. The break up went like this: seven out of 90 questions in Mathematics were omitted, three out of 60 questions in Physics, 10 out of 60 in Chemistry, and 2 out of 140 in Biology were not valued.\nIt all began when, soon after the exam, there were widespread complaints from candidates and their parents over ambiguity in the answer keys of some of the questions. They said some of the questions were out of syllabus, for some questions the answer keys were wrong and for some other questions, there were multiple correct answers. Anna University was quick to act: it set up an expert panel to evaluate the ambiguous questions and offer a solution. The committee advised deletion of these questions and redistribution of the marks for these questions to the other questions.\nAlso Read |How entrance examinations for professional courses made an entry into Tamil Nadu\nThis invited a flurry of court cases, which stalled the entire admission process for close to two months. Petitions contended these questions carried 8.8 marks and the entire merit list got exhausted within the range of 2-3 marks from the first candidate to the last one.\nSoon after the decision of Anna University was known regarding the ambiguous questions, scores of candidates approached the Madras High Court with various pleas, including setting up of an expert committee to find an acceptable solution and calling for re-examination. The cases were bunched together and heard by a single judge, Justice Prafulla Kumar Misra.\nAfter hearing senior counsels representing many of the candidates, Justice Misra directed Anna University to revalue all answer papers while laying down guidelines for valuing a few specific questions.\nAlso Read |Opposition to entrance tests dates back 3 decades\nJustice Misra’s order stated that “question numbers 27 and 33 in Biology question paper (version code MA-7) and question numbers 11, 64 and 77 of physical science (version code BS6) shall not be deleted and mark should be awarded to any student who has indicated any of the correct choices”. These questions were deleted on the ground that they had more than one correct answer.\nSimilarly, the judge ruled that question number 105 (MA-7) is to be revalued and option number 4 should be taken as the correct answer and not option number 3 as indicated by the committee. This question was: Highly concentrated mineral in the cerebro-spinal fluid is: (1) Pottasium, (2) Sodium, (3) Magnesium, (4) Chlorine.\nThe petitioners, the judgment said, contended that option 4 was the correct answer, which was also the option indicated by the paper setter as the correct answer. The expert committee, however, had suggested that option 3 was the correct answer.\nIn the counter affidavit by Anna University, the committee was stated to have opined that that chlorine being a gas in its natural form could not be considered as mineral and, even though Potassium and Sodium could be classified as minerals, those were not stable in free form and they react violently and become other compound; hence, the only other choice is Magnesium. They have referred to textbook P-239 in support of their opinion. “A perusal of the relevant pages as indicated makes it crystal clear that the question has been set by the paper setter with reference to the discussion relating to chlorine,” the judgment asserted.\nAlso Read |Tamil Nadu’s turbulent relationship with professional course entrance tests\nWhile some petitioners appealed against Justice Misra’s judgment, there were a few pending writ petitions before the High Court against considering improvement candidates on par with regular Plus Two students. All these petitions were bunched and placed before the First Bench comprising Justice Subhashan Reddy, the then Chief Justice of Madras High Court, and Justice Prabha Sridevan.\nAfter hearing both sides, the First Bench directed Anna University to revalue 11 of the questions that were not valued. It also came down heavily on Anna University for reviewing answer keys of paper setters by an expert committee. “The paper setter chooses questions from question bank where the key answers are already provided. By setting up the expert committee, the paper setter is reduced to just a clerk, as the key answer which is indicated has got absolutely no weightage as against the opinion of the expert committee as the University conducting the examination only takes note of the views of the expert committee for awarding marks. This practice has to be discontinued,” the order read.\nAnna University was directed to “take necessary steps to recompute and hold fresh counselling accordingly by including improvement candidates also”. The process of admission finally resumed on August 10 after nearly a two-month ordeal for the candidates and their parents."

    "content": "The experts of the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, have proposed a seawall along the Uppada coast in Kakinada district at a cost of ₹323 crore, recommending it as an immediate way to check the alarming speed of erosion.\nOn July 3, the NCCR experts began technical investigation along the Uppada coast in response to a request by Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan.\nMr. Pawan explained the NCCR experts about the challenges and displacement of the coastal communities due to erosion, which was on the rise since the geo-tube began to sweep away into the sea. The Kakinada-Uppada road, which leads towards Kakinada Special Economic Zone has also been damaged due to erosion.\nPrior to 2010, the 1.5 km-long geo-tube was installed along the Uppada coast. However, it could not withstand the giant waves, which dismantled the tube and ate into the fisherfolks habitations at Nemam, Ameenabad, Subbampeta, Komaragiri.\nAccording to the State Department of Survey, the Uppada coast has lost 1,360 acres of land since 2020 at the rate of 1.23 m per year and the maximum of 26.3 m of land had been lost to erosion during 2017-18.\nReferring to the NCCR’s proposal for the seawall, Kakinada MP Tangella Uday said, “The NCCR has proposed for a seawall with an estimated cost of ₹323 crore. On July 30, the proposal will be discussed by the National Disaster Management Authority in New Delhi. Secretary to Home Ministry Govind Mohan will chair the meeting.”\nIn 2021, the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS-Pune) has recommended a five-km seawall with a five-layer geomaterial to arrest the erosion along the Uppada coast, with an estimated cost of ₹176 crore."

    "content": "Former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj (1903-75), 122nd whose birth anniversary was celebrated on July 15, 2025 was known for organisational skills as well as fortifying the Congress in Tamil Nadu.\nIn his long career, he had shepherded the national party in the State so ably that the Congress won most of the electoral battles since 1946. Of course, in 1967 and 1971 Assembly polls, the limits of Kamaraj’s leadership qualities and electoral judgement came to the fore.\nThere were, however, two electoral contests - bye-elections to the Gudiyatham Assembly constituency in 1954 and to the Nagercoil (now called Kanniyakumari) Lok Sabha seat in 1969 - wherein he was a principal player and on both occasions, he achieved success with finesse. The two bye-elections had one common feature: both were held in regions outside his native district - Ramanathapuram, under which Virudhunagar [the place of his birth] fell between 1910 and 1985.\nThe need for contesting in the Gudiyatham bye-election arose for Kamaraj as he had to become a member of the legislature following his appointment as Chief Minister in April 1954. Even though the legislature of Tamil Nadu was bi-cameral then, Kamaraj did not choose to become a member of the Upper House (Legislative Council) unlike his predecessor C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji or CR) did in 1952. One of his successors C.N. Annadurai (CNA) used CR’s path in 1967. Also, there was a controversy over the way Rajaji became a Member of the Legislative Council P. Ramamurti, the Marxist theoretician and then in the undivided Communist Party of India (CPI), had unsuccessfully challenged CR’s nomination in the Madras High Court.\nKamaraj, who hailed from Virudhunagar in the southern belt of the State, was a Member of Parliament at the time of becoming the Chief Minister. The vacancy in the Legislative Assembly had existed only for Gudiyatham, which was part of the erstwhile North Arcot district (now split into Vellore, Ranipet, Thirupathur and Tiruvannamalai districts). At that time, Gudiyatham was a double-member constituency with one seat reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC).\nWhile Kamaraj, in June 1954, made it clear to the party that he would like to enter the fray for the general seat, the Scheduled Castes’ Federation (SCF), established by B.R. Ambedkar, had approached him with a request to let the Congress adopt its member for the reserved seat, according to a report of The Hindu on June 22, 1954. The report had even mentioned that [in the event of the request being accepted,] “this will be the first time” for the Congress and the SCF to have an electoral understanding. However, this proposal did not fructify, possibly due to the tense ties between Ambedkar and the Congress at the all-India level. Eventually, the SCF was left to put up its own candidate in Gudiyatham. For the reserved seat, the Congress’ nominee was T. Manavalan and the Federation’s, M. Krishnaswami.\nEven though the Congress’ candidate was the Chief Minister himself, the ruling party did not take chances. Two Central Ministers - Maragatham Chandrasekhar, who was Deputy Minister for Health, and T.T. Krishnamachari (TTK), Union Minister for Industry and Commerce - were drafted for the poll work, apart from C. Subramaniam, ranked no. 2 in the Kamaraj Cabinet and Finance Minister.\nThe Chief Minister’s principal rival was K. Kothandaraman of the CPI. Veteran journalist T.S. Chockalingam, in his biography of the former Chief Minister, mentions that members of the Congress all over the State had “turned their attention” towards Gudiyatham and “friends” from every district had begun their campaign for Kamaraj. There was “one more miracle” - the Dravidar Kazhagam and the Muslim League declaring publicly their support for him and commencing their canvassing.\nAlso Read |When BJP talks of Kamaraj rule…\nKamaraj was not one who would get carried away by “such widespread support.” He plunged himself in the campaign and carried out his work in villages. With a few weeks to go for the date of polling, he had covered 100 out of 160 villages in the constituency, The Hindu wrote on July 18, 1954. Responding to the criticism of the Communists that the Congress, despite being in power at the Centre and in States, had not resolved many problems of the country, Kamaraj, at a meeting in Cherlapalli, wondered how “age-long difficulties” of people could be removed within seven years of the country gaining Independence. Krishnamachari told the voters that Kamaraj was the “friend and follower” of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Being a person conscious of the living standards of the poor, he would “do his best” to raise them, TTK assured the voters.\nWhen the result was out on August 4, 1954, it was on expected lines. Kamaraj had defeated the CPI’s candidate by a comfortable margin - about 38,000 votes. That was the only occasion when the former Chief Minister was a candidate in the northern region of the State.\nNearly 15 years later, the political field in the State was not that benign either to Kamaraj or to the Congress. In early 1967, the national party was dislodged from power in the State nearly after a 20-year-long rule. Kamaraj himself lost in the Virudhunagar assembly constituency to a lightweight of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Spearheaded by CNA, the DMK, which had stitched a rainbow coalition comprising the Swatantara and the CPI (Marxist), had captured power in a stunning fashion. At the Centre, though the Congress was in power, there had been changes in the balance of power. The “old guard” in the ruling party was experiencing the phase of decline and naturally, there had been reports of difference between the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and some of her Cabinet colleagues, who were considered members of the “old guard.” As the Congress’ pre-eminent position in the country’s politics had started waning, new political forces were emerging.\nThe death of ‘Marshal’ A. Nesamony had necessitated the bye-election to the Nagercoil Lok Sabha constituency. Kamaraj, who was looking for an opportunity to regain people’s confidence after the Virudhunagar defeat, announced his candidature on December 1, 1968, this newspaper reported the next day. There were six other contestants. But, the battle was between him and M. Mathias, who was backed by the DMK-led alliance that included the Swatantara and the Muslim League.\nOrdinarily, Nagercoil should not have been difficult terrain for the Congress, which had a strong base even then, as is now. Besides, even in 1967, when the national party was thrashed in most of the districts, five out of six assembly constituencies, which formed Nagercoil, went in favour of the Congress. But, it was the DMK, which had decided to make the contest more intense.\nFormer Congress leader Pazha Nedumaran, in his “Perunthalaivarin Nizhalil” [In the shadow of great leader (meaning Kamaraj)], stated that the bye-election had been turned into another “Kurukshetra War,” the entire credit for which should go to the then Public Works Minister M. Karunanidhi and former Assembly Speaker Si. Pa. Aditanar, who later became a Minister in the DMK Cabinet headed by Karunanidhi. In the assessment of Mr Nedumaran, the DMK leaders had entertained the notion that if Kamaraj had tasted defeat [the possibility of which could not be ignored especially after Virudhunagar], he could be driven out of the politics of Tamil Nadu.\nWith the election fever mounting, the atmosphere was “getting surcharged” with a stream of lorries bringing supporters of rival parties from outside the district, The Hindu wrote on January 5, 1969, three days before the date of polling. “In the last 10 days, the Police have arrested about 200 persons, most of them Congressmen in connection with election clashes,” the newspaper reported. The then Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief, C.Subramaniam (CS), accused the DMK of bringing in “hired hooligans” from the neighbouring Tiruneveli district. Karunanidhi, who had overseen the campaign of Mathias, challenged CS’s allegations and put the blame on the Congress, which, he said, was “indulging in violence.” As for the complaint regarding the involvement of senior DMK Ministers in the campaign, Karunanidhi reasoned his party was “only following the example” set by the Congress. Kamaraj’s response was his party had refrained from inviting Union Ministers to campaign in the constituency, even though they were “ready to come.”\nThe bye-election frenzy rose to the boiling point on the midnight of January 4 when a worker of the DMK, Kittu, was killed and two others suffered stab injuries. That day, the head of the State police (which was called Inspector General) R.M. Mahadevan reached Nagercoil to oversee the preparations. The Superintendent of Police S. Dayasankar chose to go on medical leave for a month. He was immediately replaced by K. Srikumara Menon, Deputy Commissioner, Traffic. Madurai. On the day of polling (January 8), the then Chief Election Commissioner, S.P. Sen Verma, himself visited as many as 35 polling stations of the constituency, according to this newspaper. Given the high-decibel campaign, the voter turnout exceeded 75%, a few percentage points higher than what Nagercoil recorded in 1967.\nThere was no element of great surprise in the result. Kamaraj won the bye-election by a huge margin of 1,28,201 votes over Mathias, by polling 2,49,437 votes.\nCommenting on the former Chief Minister’s electoral battles, A. Gopanna, who had also authored his biography, feels Kamaraj always attached greater emphasis on drawing support from the people directly than anything else. R. Kannan, a biographer of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai and M.G. Ramachandran apart from writing ‘The DMK Years’, says Kamaraj, by contesting in Nagercoil, had “wanted to stay relevant.”\nKamaraj’s participation in the two bye-elections had only shown how much importance he, as a political leader, had paid to securing legitimacy from the public."

    "content": "Amid the ongoing row over alleged imposition of Hindi in schools through the National Education Policy (NEP), Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has defended the Union government’s proposal, saying that the former Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, has become a famed scholar by learning 17 languages.\n“P.V. Narasimha Rao was a scholar, fluent in 17 language. Now, we are talking why should we learn Hindi. Narasimha Rao had become a great man as he not only learnt Hindi but other languages too,” Mr. Naidu said while delivering the sixth of the PMs’ lecture series on the topic, ‘The life and legacy of P.V. Narasimha Rao’, at the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library, in New Delhi on Tuesday.\nDeputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan and HRD Minister N. Lokesh had already unequivocally supported promoting Hindi as a language.\nMr. Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party and Mr. Naidu-led TDP are partners in the NDA from South India.\nRecalling Narasimha Rao’s contribution in nation-building, Mr. Naidu, “I had a very good equation with him and knew him very well. The Telugu community is proud of him. He was a true ‘Telugu Bidda’ who had reshaped the destiny of our great nation,” Mr. Naidu observed.\nSpeaking about the pre-1991 economic scenario, Mr. Naidu outlined how the country had been shackled under the ‘License Raj’, with growth stagnating at 3-4%. By 1991, India was saddled in an unprecedented economic crisis, and foreign reserves dropped dangerously low, he said.\nComparing Narasimha Rao’s strategic courage to that of Deng Xiaoping of China, who initiated China’s reforms in 1978, Mr. Naidu said the former Prime Minister had recognised crisis as an opportunity and launched the historic 1991 economic reforms, decisively transforming India’s future. “We are all here today enjoying the fruits of the reforms he initiated,” Mr. Naidu asserted.\nPraising the political acumen of Narasimha Rao, the Chief Minister said, despite leading a minority government, he had achieved the near-impossible by forging consensus among Socialists, Communists, and Capitalists alike. Narasimha Rao had played a key role in ending the License Raj and welcoming foreign investment, and setting the stage for India’s IT revolution in the mid-1990s.\n“Thanks to his reforms, India overcame its balance of payments crisis, opened up its economy, and set the stage for future growth,” Mr. Naidu said.\nHe credited Narasimha Rao with the IT boom that was witnessed after the economic liberalisation. The Chief Minister also recalled his association with the former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, recognising his vision in building India’s infrastructure and telecom backbone.\nFurther, Mr. Naidu described 2014 as a turning point, and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with ushering in a new era of bold, decisive leadership. “Under Mr. Modi’s stewardship, India rose from the 11th to the 4th largest economy, with a clear trajectory to become the 3rd largest by 2028,” Mr. Naidu emphasised.\n“Mr. Modi is as a leader who instills national pride, global respect, and strong foreign relations,” he said. Drawing comparisons to other economies, he remarked that “the goal is not just to grow fast, but to grow fairly, where every citizen, every region, and every sector shares fruits of progress, rightly called Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.”\nHe also noted that according to the World Bank, India was among the top four most income-equal countries, lifting over 17.1 crore Indians out of poverty in the last decade.\n“Public policy must serve the people. For it to work effectively, we need stable governments and visionary leaders,” Mr. Naidu asserted. He highlighted India’s global recognition in space, healthcare, entrepreneurship, and the rise of Indian billionaires as symbols of this transformation.\nLater, Mr. Naidu took questions from the audience during which he elaborated his vision for Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the technology sector. He said that the Quantum Valley initiative was in line with the National Quantum Mission, aiming to create India’s answer to Silicon Valley. He highlighted curriculum reforms, youth leadership in his party, and a conscious effort to bring young, educated MLAs into governance.\nOn agriculture, he said, “We must handhold agriculture as our traditional occupations evolve.” On equitable wealth distribution, he emphasised the need to align the aspirations of farmers with broader policy reforms.\nMr. Naidu added, “I am 100% confident that by 2047, India will be the No. 1 country in the world. When we celebrate 100 years of Independence, Indians will lead the world.” The Chief Minister felicitated the former Prime Minister’s son, P.V. Prabhakar Rao, and grandson N.V. Subhash on the occasion."

It made its appearance late in the 19thcentury, chiefly as a game for cricket players to keep fit during the off season. ‘Playing hooky’ which meant going away from your official duties was an expression that came due to this. Interestingly, hockey or hooky was initially played in Madras without any knowledge of the rules of the game. The first record of it in the city dates back to 1894.\nThe Madras Hockey Tournament, played for “the Silver Cup presented by the Madras Cricket Club”, was the forerunner of what became the MCC All-India Hockey Tournament. The first announcement of this trophy appeared in the Madras Mail on July 20, 1901. The very first of its kind in South India, it commenced on July 22. Here again, as in cricket, we find the Madras United Club doing its bit to get Indians to play the game. The MUC’s XI, South India’s first ‘native team’ took to the field against the 25thBattery, Royal Field Artillery, from Bangalore. The MUC, judging by the report of the match, appears to have known little of the game, and was trounced 15-0. The next day, the MCC ‘A’ team appears to have played the eventual winner of the tournament, the Durham Light Infantry, with a detailed report of the match being carried by the Madras Mail. Newspaper reports referred to ‘dangerous play’ being a feature of the game.\nBy the 1920s, the game had come into its own especially with R.C. Summerhayes of Burma Shell, and a hockey blue from Oxford, taking special interest. He got the legendary M.J. Gopalan interested in the game. By the 1930s, Anglo Indian teams of Madras were taking the game to new heights. The Madras Hockey Association came into being in 1931. When it came to Indian participation in the Olympics, Madras produced its share of hockey players by way of R. Francis, Munir Sait, V. Baskaran, V.J. Philips, V.J. Peter and Krishnamurthy Perumal. We can also include Charles Cornelius here though he mainly played for Punjab.\nThe MCC All India Hockey Trophy was one of the big attractions during that golden era for the game. Teams from all over the country came to participate. But even then, there were breaks despite best efforts. The Murugappa Group, with its Murgappa Gold Cup instituted in 1962 to commemorate the 60thbirthday of A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar, joined the MCC in 1996 and since then the game has seen a fresh lease of life.\nThe semi-finals and finals of the ongoing tournament will take place on July 19 and 20 respectively. Initially played at Chepauk in the MCC’s B Ground, it has moved to the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium in recent times. For the first time this year, an overseas team, from Malaysia, is participating. And there is a third umpire to refer to. Finally, ten trees will be planted for every goal."

    "content": "Kolkata\nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers who are responsible for the improvement of nutrition and health of children are still awaiting their budget allocation, months after the declarations were made by the West Bengal government in February. Workers’ unions took out protest rallies in the city to demand increased budget allocation in nutrition, job security and permanent employment.\nThe rally was led by West Bengal Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union and All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) union of Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist). They took out three rallies and filed a deputation with the Governor of West Bengal, one at Nabanna (State Secretariat), addressing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and one at Bikash Bhawan (Child Welfare Department).\nUnion Secretary Madhavi Pandit said that if the demands are not met through the peaceful protest deputation, the workers will have to go on a larger strike in the coming days.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, another leader and ICDS worker from Murshidabad, Arifa Begum, who led the protest rally that went to Nabanna, said that as they do much of their work online, they have not been provided with smartphones to sustain the work.\n“The CM has only assured us, but there is no action on the ground. Both mother and child will lose out on their basic rights if we do not get the bare minimum. They give us ₹167 for mobile recharge. In the current economy, this is not even enough for a basic recharge to get enough data to do our work,” Ms. Begum added.\nThe workers also demanded that they get permanent job roles and fixed salaries for their labourious work. Nanda Patra, a leader of AIUTUC said that the ICDS workers are demanding that they get life insurance if anyone dies during work and a pension scheme when they retire to offer them better security.\nOn February 12, the West Bengal State budget for 2025-26 allocated ₹200 crore for the purchase of smartphones for about 70,000 ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) and Anganwadi workers. But workers say that they have not received any benefits from it even after five months.\nAnganwadi workers and ASHA workers (Accredited Social Health Activists) are the frontline healthcare workers in every community across districts and rural areas in States, helping bridge the gap between people and public healthcare systems. A major part of their job role is to provide essential services including nutritional supplements to children under six, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.\nHowever, in most States across India they are not permanent employees and do not have any employee benefits and struggle with budget issues. They are paid on contractual or honorarium basis which had led to many protests across the nation, including multiple in West Bengal."

    "content": "India’s diversity in religion and language is one of the primary factors which protects the secular character of the nation, ensuring its unity and integrity. But while religion and language are the two most crucial aspects of any culture, these are also the predominant cross-cultural barriers. This is clearly visible in recent communal tensions and the violence in Maharashtra.\nSecularism in India is different from what the West practises. When the concept originated in England in the mid-19th century, it was explained that there should be complete separation between the state and religion without criticising any of the prevalent religious beliefs. India too accepted this notion and incorporated the concept in the Constitution in the form of rights to religious freedom. These rights are based on the principles of religious tolerance and equality. Every person has the equal right to freedom of conscience and to profess, practise and propagate his religion. This makes India truly secular as the state does not have its own religion. However, the unique aspect of Indian secularism is not only related to religion but it is also concerned with language. Indian secularism is neither pro-religion or language, nor against. Yet it is not neutral either. It is incorporated in the Constitution as a state policy and it empowers the state to take steps against communalism, be it religious or linguistic.\nThis is the reason why we do not and cannot have a national language. In order to protect linguistic diversity, the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution includes 22 languages. As India is a unitary federation, that is, a Union of States, Article 343 enshrines that the official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The States are free to choose their own official language. This arrangement is due to the fact that in India, States are culturally integrated and no State is permitted to go out of it in the name of distinct language or culture.\nArticle 29 incorporates that any section of citizens of India including minority groups shall have the right to protect their language, script or culture, and that language cannot be the ground for discrimination. According to the 2011 Census, India has 121 languages and 270 mother tongues. About 96.71% population of the country have one of the 22 scheduled languages as their mother tongue. Finally, the Census says that the 121 languages are presented in two parts, languages included in the Eighth Schedule, and languages not included (99) in the Eighth Schedule.\nSuch diversity needs to be protected; each and every language irrespective of region or State must be shown respect. This is the only way to protect India’s linguistic secularism. Many southern and northeastern States have resisted the imposition of Hindi, citing fears of cultural domination. Dravidian movements in Tamil Nadu historically opposed Hindi imposition, favouring Tamil and English. Maharashtra, however, has emerged as the most sensitive State so far as the language debate is concerned. The recent violence against the non-Marathi population is the manifestation of identity politics. Definitely, it is not to protect its cultural identity. Had it been related to the protection of culture, the “protectors” of Marathi language would have considered that ‘tolerance’ and ‘liberality’ are the two pillars of India’s unity in diversity.\nIndia has always accepted different religions, ideas, lifestyles, food habits etc., mainly because of its liberal and tolerant attitude. In a globalising world, a conservative leaning towards religion or language will lead to a fragmentation of society and tear apart the secular fabric.\nPolitical parties have the onus to ensure the protection of India’s diversity which has been well shielded by the Constitution.\nC.B.P.

Maritime Board (APMB). The scheduled date of completion of the project was June 23, 2025.\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of the APMB sought the government’s guidance on the proposal for enhancement of the existing infrastructure to ensure the port’s commercial viability and its ability to handle the projected cargo volume of 34.04 MMTPA — primarily coal and iron ore — stating that it was essential to increase the port’s draft from 16m to 18.5m.\nThis would enable the port to accommodate Cape size and Super Cape size vessels, aligning its capabilities with regional and global shipping trends such as additional dredging at approach channel and berth pockets, additional railway lines up to the proposed backup yard behind three multi-purpose berths, development of backup yard infrastructure for storage of cargo, movement of trucks, and operation of material handling equipment, and additional external road connectivity and internal road connectivity within the port.\nThe APMB also requested Extension of Time (EoT) up to April 27, 2026, to the contractor for completion of the works due to analysis of work stoppages, delays in land handover, etc.\nTo consider the proposal, the GoM was constituted and asked to submit its  report / recommendations at an early date."

She also alleged that excess water release from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has led to flooding in many districts in the lower Damodar region, however, DVC has denied all allegations of unplanned water release.\nMs. Banerjee said that even after repeated warnings, the multiple dams of DVC have released heavy loads of water from Jharkhand and flooded West Bengal. She added that as Bengal is a land of water bodies filled with rivers, lakes, and ponds it suffers more during monsoons. She claimed that five lakh ponds have been dug up in the State in recent years to absorb some of the rainwater and reduce the burden on people.\nPlaces like Paschim Medinipur districts Ghatal, parts of Purba Bardhaman district, Khanakul, Arambagh in Hooghly district and Amta, Udaynarayanpur in Howrah district, and other places have been grappling with water logging for the past few weeks.\n“Be it DVC, Panchet, Maithon, none of them are listening to us. We have asked the Central government to do desilting work so they can hold an extra 4 lacs metric cusec water and help with this crisis. They have released over 27,000 lacs cubic meters of water between June 18 to July 15,” Ms. Banerjee said. She also said that they have been fighting this battle with the DVC water release and flooding for over 15 years but to no avail.\nHowever, DVC sources toldThe Hinduthat they release water only after discussions with the committee which includes West Bengal government, Jharkhand government and the DVC authorities along with the Central Water Commission. “They take view of all the stakeholders and advices about water release and we follow that order only, we do not decide water release amount on our own,” a top level official at the DVC who wanted remain anonymous said.\nThe CM also alleged that she has conducted multiple meetings and has urged the central government to find a solution. “People are facing huge losses. Assam gets flood relief money; we do not. They only release water here and abandon us... They get votes saying they will work for people, after the votes they only work for themselves,” Ms. Banerjee added.\nShe asked all government administrative officials to maintain vigil and constantly monitor the flood situation closely and to create more relief centers than before to help people affected by the floods. The CM asked officials to keep snake bite anti-venom in stock and ensure that no open electric lines cause any electrocution accidents."

Within a month, the party will expand, motivating people to join the party,” said former Minister Mr. Shinde.\nNCP-SP Supremo Sharad Pawar announced Mr. Shinde’s appointment at a party’s State executive meeting at the Y.B. Chavan Centre in Mumbai in the presence of prominent leaders from the party, including Jayant Patil, former Minister Anil Deshmukh, Kalwa legislator Jitendra Awhad, and Harshvardhan Patil.\nAfter the poor performance at the 2024 Assembly elections, Mr. Patil expressed his desire to resign and hand over to a new leader. Over the past few days, the resignation of Jayant Patil, who stayed back with Sharad Pawar’s NCP after the split in 2023 and the appointment of Shashikant Shinde was speculated. Mr. Shinde’s name has been announced ahead of the upcoming local body elections in the State, aiming to yield good results for the party.\nReferring to the vacuum in Maharashtra’s politics, the 62-year-old Mr. Shinde said, “Currently, space is there for Opposition. If we try to fill this space, people will relate and stand with us.”\nMr. Shinde also highlighted that politics have changed; earlier, the government changed when the opposition raised public concerns, now the government is changing using the resources and system of government.\nA commerce graduate and popularly known as the Mathadi workers’ leader, he began his political career in 1999, winning the Jaoli Assembly elections and later serving as Water Resources Minister.\n“This is not the end, it is the beginning of a new era,” Jayant Patil expressed his feelings through poetry. After offering his resignation, Mr. Patil touched on his tenure and the party’s journey of providing opportunities to people from ordinary families, shattering the nepotism.\n“The party broke the norms and gave opportunities to young people, including Mehboob Sheikh, Sakshana Salgar, and Sunil Gavane. Sharad Pawar gave strength to people who started from zero and gave them strength. I have been president for the last seven years; otherwise, I have been working in this party for the last 25 years. It is the right time to make way for others to take this opportunity,” he added\nMr. Patil reflected on the 2024 Assembly elections and stated that the match had been fixed Umpire. Reflecting on the government’s policy, he said, “We have a big challenge to preserve theSwarajyacreated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The State has been subjected to religious fanaticism and corruption on the pretext of development. The atrocities against women have increased, while farmers are in a dreadful situation. The government is proving incapable of keeping its promises.”"

    "content": "On the 71st convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) director Dr. Suman Chakraborty said “the world does not need more technocrats”, highlighting the institute’s renewed focus on human-centric, multidisciplinary technology research.\n“Let me be clear: the world does not need more technocrats. It needs humans who can think and feel — who can use algorithms, but are not ruled by them. The future belongs to those who can combine emotional intelligence with technical intelligence,” the director said.\nIn an exclusive interaction with select media, Mr. Chakraborty elaborated that earlier, technocrats relied on extensive research and skill-learning, whereas in the current day scenario, AI systems like ChatGPT can generate answers to most science and tech questions.\n“Unfortunately, it will take a whole lot of time to create a four-year undergraduate programme where answers will not be generable by ChatGPT. So, when these things are already there, students have to elevate themselves where they can innovate, interpret between lines, converge between domains, and come up with solutions that are both technologically advanced as well as human-centric,” the director said.\nHe added that IIT KGP is looking to equip future students with the knowledge of using AI more ethically.\nMr. Chakraborty also highlighted how the research on AI, deeptech, cloud computing, etc., at IIT KGP is advancing in converging domains, with a mix of traditional and non-traditional subjects like AI in diagnostics, medicine, law, humanities, etc.\n“In terms of research on AI, we are also thinking of exploring certain domains where the research will be led by non-AI domain experts… Usually, the engineering and science departments kick off science and tech projects, taking humanities and social sciences as complementary aspects in some cases. In that way, we are concerned with how AI can be more empathetically used to bridge the gap between AI and humans,” he said.\nMr. Chakraborty also said that IIT KGP is pushing boundaries with research across cybersecurity, AI, cloud computing, and disease modelling. He added that the AI models designed by the institute are being used for disaster response and precision agriculture.\n“Our AI department, now a full-fledged academic unit, offers BTech., MTech., and interdisciplinary dual degree programs. It has become a national leader in responsible and explainable AI with real-world applications in healthcare, climate, and linguistics, and with emphasis on human-centric AI… we are therefore not just building machines, we are building meaning,” he added.\nThe Director also unveiled PLATO, an AI-powered coding tutor that offers real-time, personalised guidance to students learning computer programming.\nThe director said that the institute is working on its “shortcomings” to make itself a more preferred choice for nationwide talent.\n“We are good at classroom teaching, but beyond that, we are working on improving infrastructure, improving quality of life, and making campus life more vibrant. We should connect everything. As part of our Platinum Jubilee, we are also building a special amenities centre, an all-in-one unit that can help students have an enjoyable lifestyle while facilitating all-round growth,” Mr. Chakraborty said.\nMr. Chakraborty also touched upon the global gender disparity in science, technology, medicine and engineering,\n“Women are not just contributors — they are disruptors, creators, and changemakers — and at IIT KGP, we thrive not merely to preach this spirit but portray the same in practice,” he added.\nNotably, gender ratios in several branches of the IIT remain skewed despite girl students excelling in all-India examinations. On Tuesday, less than half of the graduating students being awarded prestigious medals at IIT KGP’s convocation ceremony were women.\nThis year, IIT KGP awarded a total of 3,731 degrees across various disciplines, including 277 PhD, 18 MS, 956 M.Tech, 50 MCP, 142 MBA, 23 EMBA, 58 PGDBA, 5 MMST, 28 MHRM, 18 M.Arch, 47 LLM, 31 LLB, 786 Dual Degree, 614 B.Tech (Hons), 46 B.Arch (Hons), 151 Four-Year B.S, 260 Five-Year M.Sc, 214 Two-Year M.Sc, 3 M.Sc M.Tech, 3 Three-Year M.Sc, and 1 Certificate of Excellence in Research (CER).\nAwards such as the President’s Gold Medal, Prime Minister’s Gold Medal, and others were conferred upon graduating students and scholars.\nDr. S. Somanath, former chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was the chief guest."

    "content": "For years, Kumari Hema* never truly belonged anywhere. A 32-year-old mother of one, she moved from colony to colony in Hyderabad, chased by whispers, evicted by landlords, and judged by neighbours who recoiled the moment they learnt the truth: that she was a survivor of sexual assault.\n“We used to skip meals just to pay ₹3,500 in rent for a place that barely felt like a home,” she recalled, her voice quivering with emotion. “Even then, the owners would harass us,” she said.\nThat burden, she says, has now been lifted.\nHema is one of several survivors who have been allotted a 2BHK flat in newly-built community housing in the city’s emerging residential hubs. This is part of an initiative by the Telangana government under its Indiramma Indlu housing scheme. The homes are being allotted to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) victims of serious crimes, including rape and murder cases, where convictions have been secured, with the aim of offering safety, dignity and a fresh start.\n“Now, no one can ask me to leave. I have a house of my own. My name is on the patta certificate. For someone whose name was once on an FIR, this feels like a real identity,” she said, smiling through her eyes.\nFor 27-year-old Sonal*, life too had come to a halt after she was sexually assaulted. A promising engineering student at the time, she dropped out of college and retreated from the world due to the trauma and pain the incident brought. Now, years later, she has cleared the Telangana Law Common Entrance Test and is preparing to start an LLB course through distance education in about a month.\n“I stopped believing that a future was even possible,” the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) victim said. “But things are changing. I’ve got a second chance in my studies, in my marriage, and now in my own new home.” Sonal, who works part-time as a teacher got married six months ago and is about to move into her new flat with her husband. She is already scouting for nearby schools to work at while continuing her education.\nSudha Laxmi*, 35, a mother of two and a domestic worker, has lived in the same locality for nearly three decades. But familiarity did not spare her from stigma after she was assaulted, even after the perpetrator was convicted. “Neighbours never let me forget it. I faced taunts for years,” she said. “I’m relieved to leave it all behind.”\nThe women are waiting for final plumbing and electrical work to be completed before they shift into the apartments, built as part of the first phase of the government’s broader housing initiative for atrocity victims. Under this phase, 43 survivors in Cyberabad and 25 from Rachakonda have been allotted homes.\nThe district’s SC Development Wing, in collaboration with the police, compiles lists of eligible victims. These are cases from 2014 onwards that ended in conviction. The focus, officials say, is on verified cases to avoid legal complications and ensure security.\n“These are people who were not just victims of crime, but also of societal neglect. The least we can do is give them a sense of belonging,” said a senior police officer associated with the project.\n“The entire process is handled discreetly. In most cases, they are moved into neighbourhoods where others from their community already live.”\nThe 2BHK homes themselves are simple but sufficient. Each flat is 560 square feet, with two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen, and two bathrooms. The kitchen opens out onto a small balcony with a washing area. Many occupants have chosen to upgrade the flooring, add tiles or false ceilings, or personalise the space in a small but meaningful ways.\n*Names have been changed to protect the identities of the survivors."

During their journey, the woman, who was pregnant, went into labour and gave birth to a baby boy. However, the couple wrapped the newborn in a piece of cloth and threw him out of the vehicle,” the official said.\nThe driver of the sleeper bus, which has compartments with upper and lower berths, noticed that something was thrown out of a window. When he enquired about it, Shaikh told him that his wife had vomited as she felt nauseated due to the bus journey, he said.\n“Meanwhile, when an alert citizen on the road checked what was thrown out of the bus window, he was shocked to find that it was a baby boy. He immediately alerted the police by calling their 112 helpline,” he said.\nA team of the local police on patrolling duty subsequently intercepted the bus. After inspecting the vehicle and conducting a preliminary probe, they took the woman and Shaikh into custody, the official said.\nThe couple said they dumped the newborn as they were unable to raise the child, he said, adding that the baby died after being thrown on the road.\nAccording to the police, Dhere and Shaikh both hailed from Parbhani and were staying in Pune for the last one-and-a-half years. They claimed to be husband and wife but failed to produce any document to support the claim, the official said.\n“After taking them into custody, the police rushed the woman to a hospital for treatment,” he said.\nA case was registered against the couple at Pathri police station in Parbhani under section 94 (3), (5) of BNS (concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body), he said.\nA notice has been served to the accused persons, and further probe in the case was underway, he said."

    "content": "For 12 long years, 29 tribal families from the Kodarvi community lived in exile, forced to leave their ancestral village of Mota Pipodra in Danta taluka in Banaskantha district due to an age-old custom known as ‘Chadotaru’—a tradition rooted in vengeance. But now, these families, comprising around 300 members, will finally return home, on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nThe Kodarvi families had migrated to Palanpur and Surat over a decade ago, leaving behind their homes, land, and memories. The ‘Chadotaru’ custom, which had led to disputes, made life in the village untenable for them. For years, they lived as outsiders, yearning to return but bound by fear and tradition.\nRecognising their plight, the Banaskantha police initiated a meticulous process of reconciliation, and held multiple meetings with village elders, panchayat members, and community leaders to ensure a peaceful homecoming, said Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi.\nAdding to the emotional significance of this return, the District Administration identified and revived the families’ ancestral land—approximately 8.5 hectares of once-barren terrain that had turned wild with neglect. “The land was cleared, leveled, and made cultivable again, symbolising a fresh start,” Mr. Sanghavi said.\nAs part of the rehabilitation plan, two houses have already been constructed, while the remaining 27 families will receive homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and with the support of social organisations, the Minister said.\nOn July 17, Mr. Sanghavi said that they would welcome the families back to Mota Pipodra in a ceremony. The event will include a prayer ritual and the symbolic sowing of seeds on their revitalised land—a gesture of renewal and prosperity. The Minister said he would also distribute educational kits, ration supplies, and discuss long-term rehabilitation plans with the families.\n“This is not just about bringing people back to their village; it is about healing old wounds and building a future of harmony,” said Mr. Sanghavi. “We believe no tribal family should be left displaced due to outdated customs. Development and dialogue will always triumph over discord.”\nFor the Kodarvi families, this homecoming is nothing short of a miracle—a chance to reclaim their roots, their land, and their dignity."

    "content": "The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave in-principle approval for the rejuvenation and beautification of Ramannakunta Lake in New Bowenpally, marking a major step toward transforming the long-neglected water body into a vibrant recreational and ecological space. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has proposed a detailed plan for the lake’s revival, including desilting, bund strengthening, stone revetment, and the creation of amenities such as open gyms, children’s play areas, and a walking track.\n“The beautification of Ramannakunta Lake has been approved by the Board. We are now awaiting a No Objection Certificate from the Army since the lake falls under their jurisdiction. The project is intended not just to enhance the area’s livability but also to improve groundwater recharge and local biodiversity,” said Madhukar Naik, CEO of SCB.\nThe proposal is part of a wider slate of urban development initiatives discussed during Tuesday’s Board meeting, which saw deliberations on infrastructure, public health, and civic administration.\nThe board discussed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HMDA for infrastructure development in lieu of direct cash compensation for the Defence land.Instead of depositing ₹303.62 crore into the Consolidated Fund of India, the State Governmenthas proposed carrying out development works such as underground sewer upgrades, strengthening of the Picket and Hasmathpet nalas, and stormwater drain construction across various Cantonment wards. An escrow account, as mandated by the Ministry of Defence’s corrigendum dated July 8, will track expenditures and project milestones. HMDA will also be responsible for funding any cost overruns or shortfalls.\nOn the healthcare front, the Board is expected to finalise an MoU with Maxvision Eye Hospital to offer cashless eye treatment to SCB employees and their dependents. This step aligns with Central Government directives allowing treatment at CGHS-empanelled hospitals at CGHS rates, thereby eliminating the need for upfront payments by beneficiaries.\nThe SCB has approved the installation of open gym equipment across various residential colonies and parks under its jurisdiction. The initiative aims to improve public health infrastructure and promote fitness among residents. In line with this, the Board is also considering the approval of specific locations for the installation of the open gym equipment. A total of ten sites across different wards have been proposed, ensuring equitable access to fitness amenities in multiple neighbourhoods, added Mr. Madhukar Naik."

    "content": "The Kerala Home department has reportedly endorsed the then State Police Chief’s (SPC) reportwhich states that a sequence of preventable oversights on the part of the State law enforcement and certain sections of the temple management contributed to the widespread public dissatisfaction over the conduct of the iconic Thrissur Pooram ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.\nThe State Cabinet had ordered the then SPC Sheikh Darvesh Saheb to conduct a multi-tiered probe into the alleged Thrissur Pooram “disruption”. It brought the then Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, M. R. Ajith Kumar, who was the highest-ranking officer at the festival venue, under the investigation’s ambit.\nAccording to official sources, Home Secretary Biswanath Sinha “made a note recommending appropriate action” on the SPC’s report and forwarded it to the Cabinet. However, the officials said they were unsure whether the report pointedly blamed Mr. Ajith Kumar for the “policing flaws”.\nThe Thrissur Pooram “disruption” controversy rapidly acquired a political dimension during the heat of the Lok Sabha election campaign. The Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later faulted the State police for “botching” the festival.\nSubsequently, Revenue Minister K. Rajan, who is in charge of Thrissur district and was actively involved in the festival’s conduct, seemed to tacitly endorse the CPI’s accusation by stating that a top-ranking official in charge of the festival’s security, crowd control, fireworks, public safety, emergency response and traffic management did not respond to his urgent calls.\nLater, the Congress and the CPI alleged that the festival’s “disruption” had adversely impacted public opinion and paved the way for the BJP’s resounding win in the Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency. Both parties signalled a conspiracy allegedly involving a ranking officer and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leadership to bolster the BJP’s chances of bagging the Thrissur seat.\nAccording to officials, the SPC’s report blamed administrative, planning and law enforcement “blind spots” for the “brief discontinuance” of the festivities.\nThey said the SPC’s investigation possibly side-stepped the political controversies centred around the issue and focussed more on providing a roadmap for the festival’s smooth conduct.\nThe SPC also reportedly emphasised the need for stakeholders, including the Thiruvambady-Paramekkavu Devaswoms and the district administration, to reach a consensus on sensitive matters such as crowd control, road closures, vehicular and pedestrian traffic management, fireworks, and elephant processions, rather than making arbitrary and impromptu decisions that cause unnecessary friction."

    "content": "The Water Resources Department (WRD) will establish a separate wing, State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO), with a dedicated chief engineer for effective management of dam safety and implementation of various initiatives, including dam rehabilitation and improvement projects in Tamil Nadu.\nThe SDSO will be the 15thwing of the WRD, bifurcated from the Operation and Maintenance Wing, and would adhere to the Dam Safety Act, 2021. The State government recently issued an order, notifying the constitution of the SDSO headed by a chief engineer to adhere to the requirements of the Act and perform the functions specified by it.\nThe Act specifies that States with more than 30 dams must have an SDSO. Therefore, the formation of a wing was essential to prioritise the safety of dams that are several decades old. Tamil Nadu has nearly 128 dams, including 90 under the WRD and 38 under the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco).\nSources in the WRD said that the functions of the SDSO could not be effectively carried out due to the lack of a functional head. This wing would be a monitoring and advisory body, which would coordinate with the State Dam Safety Committee and National Dam Safety Authority. It would have 25-30 members with expertise in hydrology, dam hydro mechanics, and dam safety engineering.\nThe wing would perform various activities like inspection, vulnerability and hazard classification of the dams, recording dam failures and funds for maintenance and repairs. Moreover, some of the major tanks and water bodies would be brought under the dam category, warranting enhanced monitoring and special attention, sources said.\nBesides inspection of the dams once in five years, ongoing initiatives likeDRIP-II being carried out with World Bank assistancewould be expedited.\nThe new wing would also coordinate with National Dam Safety Authority on rapid risk assessment of dams to evaluate potential impact during dam failure."

I have a better idea for you. Why don’t you look at Andhra Pradesh instead? We have an attractive aerospace policy for you, with best-in-class incentives and over 8000 acres of ready-to-use land (just outside  Bengaluru)! Hope to see you soon to talk across the table.”\nHis father and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had earlier ruffled feathers in Karnataka by offering a 10,000-acre land parcel in Anantapur district to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for potential expansion.\nKarnataka’s Labour Minister Santosh Lad, meanwhile, assured that the State government will “find a solution” to the land acquisition issue. Speaking to news agency ANI, he said that the government has asked famers to voluntarily give their land and clarified that the project isn’t scrapped. “For the last five decades, we have been in the number one position in GDP. We will find a solution. The farmers had a strong opinion that this land should not be given to anyone else. We have asked farmers to voluntarily give us their land. It doesn’t mean the project is scrapped,” he said.\nThe Karnataka government had proposed acquiring 1,777 acres of land in Devanahalli taluk for an aerospace park. While the final notification for the project had been issued, Karnataka government dropped the process of land acquisition in 13 villages following resistance by farmers. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nMr. Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15. However, he also said that the government would acquire property of those farmers who have volunteered to give up their land for the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of a developed land."

    "content": "The political temperature is rising in the Union Territory of Puducherry ahead of the 2026 Assembly election with the Opposition upping the ante against Bharatiya Janata Party and its ruling ally the All India N. R. Congress headed by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy following the contentious decision to replace the sole BJP Minister from the Scheduled Caste community with a party legislator who had come under the scanner of the High Court and the Puducherry police in a temple land grab case.\nRecently, the BJP high command had asked its Minister from the Dalit community A. K.Sai J. Saravanan Kumar to step down ostensibly as part of a prior understanding of sharing the Cabinet berth. Even as the move to remove the sole Dalit representative in the Cabinet triggered an outcry in the political circles, what has exacerbated matters is the choice of BJP legislator A. John Kumar, who had come under a cloud in a land grab case involving a prime property belonging to the famed Kamatchi Amman Temple in the heart of the city.\nThe issue being held against Mr. Kumar’s induction is a case the CB-CID wing of the Puducherry police had registered in 2023 in connection with the grabbing of around 64,000 sq. ft. of Kamatchi Amman temple land at Rainbow Nagar in the town. The police registered a case against several Revenue Officials for conniving with a business group to grab the land. During investigation, the role of some politicians had also surfaced.\nIn the meantime, on a petition filed by a devotee, the High Court had directed Mr. Kumar, his legislator son Richards John Kumar, also belonging to the BJP, and four of their family members to return the temple property to prove their bona fide in the wake of their claim of having been innocent purchasers who had no role to play in the allegations of fabrication of documents, corruption, and collusion with government officials to grab the temple land.\nThe Court had asked the government to take possession of the land and directed the two legislators to subject themselves to the criminal investigation undertaken by the CB-CID in Puducherry. Subsequently, the District Administration took possession of the land and handed over the property to the Kamatchi Amman Temple trust.\nThough the CB-CID had made several arrests, including two senior officers belonging to Pondicherry Civil Services, the probe agency has maintained a silence on the progress made in the case which invited criticism from the Opposition parties. The Enforcement Directorate had alsosuo moturegistered a case and sought details from the government about particulars of the case.\nThe case related to the temple land had started to hound Mr. Kumar ever since his name cropped up for the Ministerial berth to fill the vacancy, with the Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), vehemently opposing the decision of the BJP to include the Kamaraj Nagar constituency legislator in Mr. Rangasamy-led Cabinet. Opposition leaders have issued statements criticising the BJP for projecting an image of being “proponents of Hindutva while allowing people involved in temple land grabbing case to occupy Ministerial position.”\nApart from the Congress and the Left parties, the Hindu Munnani too has taken up cudgels against the BJP for inducting a partyman who was facing temple land grab charges. On the very day the Ministry of Home Affairs cleared the name of Mr. Kumar for being inducted into the Cabinet, around 75 Youth Congress workers sent letters to President Droupadi Murmu seeking her intervention in preventing Mr. Kumar from becoming a Minister as he and his family members were under the scanner in a case relating to usurping temple land.\nThe Hindu Munnani, which had been in the forefront of a campaign opposing the temple land grab, has come out in the open against the BJP local leadership for inducting a “scam-tainted” person in the Cabinet. Just hours before Lieutenant Governor K. Kailashnathan administered the oath of office to Mr. Kumar at Raj Nivas on Monday, several Hindu Munnani activists held a day-long protest in the town over giving the legislator a Cabinet berth.\nThe Hindu Munnani activists who participated in the protest vowed to intensify the agitation in the coming days. The cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also held a separate protest during the same time against the swearing-in of the BJP legislator.\nCiting the appointment of Mr. Kumar as a Minister, former Chief Minister and Congress veteran V. Narayanasamy at a press conference termed the Hindutva ideology stated by the BJP as “fake” and hinted at the Congress party’s plans to expose the BJP for giving a Ministerial berth to a person accused of grabbing temple land.\nAs the issue gets more traction in the political arena of the Union Territory, the BJP would have to redouble its efforts to convince followers that its legislator was an innocent victim who was duped into buying usurped temple land and that Mr. Kumar was offered a Ministerial post to honour a prior understanding to strengthen the outreach to Christian community in the former French enclave.\nAlong with the induction of Mr. Kumar into the Cabinet, another issue that has put the BJP in a tight spot and given the Opposition fresh ammunition against the ruling establishment ahead of the 2026 Assembly poll was the decision to replace Mr. Sai Saravanan. He was the lone Dalit member in Mr. Rangasamy’s Cabinet after the AINRC legislator, S. Chandira Priyanga, was removed from the Cabinet reportedly because the Chief Minister was not satisfied with her handling of subjects assigned to her.\nThe AINRC-BJP combine has come in for severe criticism from the Opposition ranks on the omission of a Scheduled Caste representative from the Cabinet. With the Opposition, particularly Congress, giving enough indication of keeping the issues of appointment of Mr. Kumar in the Ministry and lack of Dalit representation in the Cabinet, alive by organising a series of agitations against the ruling combine, it is unlikely that the political temperature will come down any time soon."

The brand, however, clarified in a reply to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce that the showcased sandals are still at the design stage and not yet confirmed for commercial production.\n“Four members of their technical team, including the heads of footwear design of Prada and two external consultants, visited Kolhapur on Tuesday (July 15, 2025). They toured the Kolhapuri chappal manufacturing cluster, observed the production process, and held discussions with local artisans,\" said Lalit Gandhi, president of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.\nHighlighting the craftsmanship involved, Mr. Gandhi said, “Our chappals are handmade and rooted in tradition. The team will now submit a report to its corporate office, and based on that, senior officials from Prada may visit Kolhapur in the next phase.” When asked about the possibility of collaboration, Mr. Gandhi said the visit itself was a positive sign. “The fact that Prada sent a technical team all the way to Kolhapur indicates serious interest. This is perhaps the first time a Prada delegation has come to Maharashtra,” he said.\nHe further said that Prada had created a product inspired by the Kolhapuri chappals. “Once we noticed the design on the runway, we raised an objection and asked them to acknowledge its origins. They responded to us via email, accepting that the theme was inspired by Kolhapuri chappals,” said Gandhi.\nLater on Tuesday, the visiting team also toured the retail market area in Kolhapur and interacted with shopkeepers."

Failure to file the reports in the next eight weeks will have consequences, the bench noted sternly.\nIn January 15,the court ruled that access to proper sanitationis recognised as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Issuing a slew of directions, it asked High Courts, State governments and UTs to ensure availability of separate toilet facilities for men, women, persons with disabilities and transgender persons in all court premises and tribunals.\nIt also asked for a status report within four months.\nOn Wednesday, the bench noted that only the High Courts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Calcutta, Delhi and Patna had filed affidavits giving details of actions taken to comply with the directions of the judgement.\nThere are 25 High Courts in the country.\n“Many High Courts are yet to file their affidavits/compliance report… we grant them the last opportunity to file the compliance reports within eight weeks. We make it clear that if they fail to file the status reports, then the registrar general of the High Courts will remain present personally in the court,” the bench ordered.\nIn its January 15 judgement, the court said the High Courts shall oversee and ensure that the facilities are clearly identifiable and accessible to judges, advocates, litigants and court staff.\n\"For the aforesaid purpose, a committee shall be constituted in each of the High Courts under the chairmanship of a Judge nominated by the Chief Justice and members comprising the Registrar General/Registrar of the High Court, the Chief Secretary, the PWD Secretary and the Finance Secretary of the State, a representative of the Bar Association and any other officers as they deem it fit...\"\nIt directed the committee to formulate a comprehensive plan and compile numbers on how many people visited the courts every day on an average and ensure that sufficient separate washrooms are built and maintained.\n\"The State Governments/UTs shall allocate sufficient funds for construction, maintenance and cleanliness of the toilet facilities within the court premises, which shall be periodically reviewed in consultation with the committee constituted by the High Courts. A status report shall be filed by all the High Courts and the States/UTs within a period of four months,\" the bench said.\nThe top court's judgement came on a PIL filed by advocate Rajeeb Kalita."

It helps ascertain if students are just beginning to use drugs or they are hooked on to it. This enables counsellors to make informed decisions about the referral services needed by students, whether it is counselling or medication to help them kick the drug habit.\nTeachers and parents too can use this screening test for a more effective response to the drug problem.\nThe counsellors say follow-ups will held them know if students are taking the medication required to wean them away from drugs or have resumed substance abuse.\nThey also stress the need for healthy family relationships for children’s well-being and keeping an eye on children, their rooms, and belongings to spot signs of drug abuse, if any, early and asking for help instead of trying to hide it."

People’s lives are more important than loan recovery,” he said.\nThe Minister said that none should act inhumanly during loan recovery.

I will also raise this with the Chief Minister,” he said.\nDeputy Commissioner Divya Prabhu G.R.J. said that all banks had been warned against adjusting any government aid or compensation towards farm loans. “A formal proposal in this regard had already been submitted to the State Bankers’ Committee and the government by the district administration,” she said.\nShe mentioned that, sometimes due to technical reasons, government funds might get credited to loan accounts, but the banks were now returning the funds to beneficiaries’ savings accounts.  The Deputy Commissioner said that as the issue was prevalent across the country, it required rectification at the government level."

    "content": "Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, officially known as Kanthapuram A. P. Aboobacker Musliyarand serving as the tenth Grand Mufti of India, has successfully facilitated the deferment of the execution of Indian nurse Nimisha Priya in Yemen. The intervention, built on his role as India’s highest Sunni religious authority and carried out through Islamic legal norms likediyāh(blood money), spotlights a rare instance of religious and diplomatic mediation in a foreign Sharia court.\nSheikh Abubakr Ahmad was elected Grand Mufti of India on February 24, 2019, by the All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam, a national body of Sunni clerics. Born as A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar in Kanthapuram, Kozhikode, Kerala, he has risen to national prominence through his decades-long leadership in Islamic education, social welfare, and public discourse. He is also the general secretary of the All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama and the Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama — two of India’s most influential Sunni Muslim organisations. His rise to the title of Grand Mufti, a largely symbolic but influential position, marked a historic moment as he became one of the few South Indian scholars to hold the post.\nAccording to his official website, Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad is the founder and chancellor of Markazu Saquafathi Sunniyya (Jamia Markaz), established in 1978 in Kerala. The institution has expanded to encompass a comprehensive network of educational centres, charitable organisations, and social service units. He has represented Indian Muslim scholars at international forums, including sessions at the United Nations and events organised by UNESCO. He is also a regular participant in global interfaith conferences. Through initiatives such as the International Peace Conference and Markaz-run educational programmes, he has been involved in activities focused on education, religious scholarship, and community welfare.\nThecase of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala, sentenced to death in Yemen for the 2017murder of Yemeni national Talal Abdo Mahdi, drew widespread attention in India. With the execution scheduled for July 16, 2025, urgent appeals were made by human rights activists and public representatives. Among them was Kerala Congress MLA Chandy Oommen, who approached Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, requesting his intervention to secure clemency under Islamic law. Recognising the urgency and humanitarian concern, the Grand Mufti reached out to prominent Yemeni Sufi scholar Sheikh Habib Umar bin Hafiz to explore the possibility of obtaining a pardon from the victim’s family under the Islamic concept ofdiyāh.\nAlso Read:Execution of Indian nurse in Yemen: Sunni leader Kanthapuram talks to Yemeni scholar in bid to save Nimisha Priya’s life\nYemen’s legal system, rooted in Islamic law, allows for the family of a murder victim to pardon the accused in exchange for financial compensation, ordiyāh. Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad utilised this principle in his appeal, stating that Islam encourages forgiveness and reconciliation. He emphasised to Yemeni religious leaders that “in Islam, there is another law where the victim’s family pardons the accused”. He suggested that this path be pursued in the case of Nimisha Priya. Through coordinated efforts involving Yemeni tribal leaders, judicial authorities, and religious scholars, her execution was temporarily deferred.\nThe most immediate outcome ofSheikh Abubakr Ahmad’s intervention has been the postponement of Nimisha Priya’s execution. The stay was granted after last-minute negotiations in Damar, Yemen, initiated through religious channels. Talks between the victim’s family and mediators, both religious and diplomatic, are ongoing. The hope now is to secure a full pardon through a formaldiyāhagreement, which could lead to Nimisha Priya ’s release from capital punishment.\nIn a final bid to save Nimisha Priya, Mr. Aboobacker Musliar has appealed to Mahdi’s family to pardon her. With her execution looming, Nimisha Priya’s fate now rests on the victim’s family’s willingness to accept $1 million indiyāh(blood money) and grant her clemency. Sources close to Mr. Aboobacker Musliar have been hopeful that Habib Omar’s respected status and influence in Yemeni society will help secure a favourable outcome for Nimisha.\nAddressing the media at Karanthur, near Kozhikode, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Aboobacker Musliar said that he successfully appealed to Yemeni scholars to intervene in Nimisha Priya’s case, considering the importance of saving a human life. “We have just received official confirmation from the Yemeni authorities that Nimisha Priya’s execution has been stayed based on our request. Let us all pray for her safe release,” he said."

    "content": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) began the final hearing on a writ petition filed for vacating the Tambaram Police Commissionerate from a rented building located on Semmozhi Salai in Sholinganallur and to hand over the vacant possession of the premises to its owners.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh heard the arguments advanced by senior counsel V. Raghavachari for the owners of the property, D.H. Sarath Kumar, D. Venkatesh, and D. Choudry, who had filed the writ petition, on Wednesday and decided to hear Advocate General P.S. Raman on Thursday (July 17).\nIn his submissions, the senior counsel said, the petitioners had rented out their property measuring 27,250 sq. ft. to the police commissionerate from January 2022 only on the basis of an assurance given by its first Commissioner M. Ravi to pay a monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh.\nAccordingly, a lease agreement was signed for three years between the property owners and an Additional Superintendent on behalf of the Commissionerate, agreeing for the monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh for 11 months and to revise it periodically as per market value.\nHowever, the State government did not pay the rent for several months citing the objections raised by the Finance department and finally, it came out with an offer of a monthly rent of ₹6.33 lakh on the basis of an inspection carried out by a Public Works Department Executive Engineer.\nSince the petitioners were not agreeable to the offer made by the government, they insisted on vacating the property and handing over vacant possession but the Police department was continuing to occupy it, citing its strategic location and easy access to the public, the senior counsel said.\nFurther, stating that the petitioners had rented out only ground plus four floors to the commissionerate, he complained that the Police department had unauthorisedly put up constructions on the terrace too. He said, even the car parking area was not spared and as many as 45 cabins had been created over there.\nAfter turning the open car parking area too into an office, the Police department had put up car sheds on an adjacent piece of land, which had not been rented out to the commissionerate, and begun to park its cars over there. Such unauthorised use of the land had led to blocking the passage to the petitioners’ another property, he said.\n“It is the law enforcement machinery which is doing all this. I can’t go and complain to anybody but for this court. The Tambaram Commissionerate wasinaugurated by the Chief Minister himself. The owners are in deep distress. They have debts too. They want to sell this property after vacating the tenant,” the senior counsel added.\nAfter relying upon a judgment in support of his plea to direct the government and the police commissionerate to vacate the rented property, Mr. Raghavachari said: ‘”When the British ruled us, we were complaining about lack of rule of law. Now, we are ruling ourselves and still there is no rule of law.”"

Chinchurani announced the decision at a press conference here on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) after a high-level meetingamid rising cases of stray dog bites and deaths due to rabies.\nAs per Section 8 of the Animal Husbandry Rules, the euthanasia of an animal can be carried out when the Union government or the State government finds any animal which is so diseased that it can spread the disease, in order to control such disease. A registered veterinary practitioner has to certify that the animal is mortally injured or so severely injured or in such a physical condition that it shall be cruel to keep it alive.\nMr. Rajesh said the State government had to depend on the Animal Husbandry Rules for allowing euthanasia of diseased stray dogs as the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules do not allow euthanasia.\n“The State government will again request the Union government to amend the ABC rules as it slows down the progress of ABC activities. Another challenge is the opposition from the local population against opening ABC centres. The government will take action related to obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions against those who try to impede the functioning of ABC units,” he said.\nEight mobile ABC units, purchased by the Animal Husbandry department, will be deployed immediately. The Local Self-Government department will also over the next two months deploy mobile ABC units in each of the 152 block panchayats in the State. Panchayats have been directed to identify ideal locations to park the mobile units. The mobile units are meant to overcome the local opposition while setting up permanent ABC centres in various localities. Vaccination of stray dogs will be carried out in August. Licensing and vaccination of pet dogs will done in September."

    "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee lashed out at the BJP-led Centre on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) for what, she called, its policy of harassing and mistreating Bengali-speaking people across the country and warned the saffron party of dire political consequences if it did not put an immediate stop to such actions.\nMs. Banerjee also alleged that the ruling dispensation at the Centre was “influencing the Election Commission of India” to achieve its political ambitions across states.\nShe was speaking at a public meeting after holding a protest march in rain-drenched Kolkata against the alleged torture of Bengali-speaking people in BJP-ruled States.\n“I will challenge the central government notices which were surreptitiously sent to BJP-ruled states to harass Bengali-speaking people and detain them at the slightest suspicion,” the Trinamool Congress supremo alleged at the rally, which terminated at the Dorina Crossing in central Kolkata.\n“I am ashamed and disheartened at the Centre and the BJP's attitude towards Bengalis,” Ms. Banerjee claimed.\nExpressing her resolve to fight the BJP “inch by inch” if it tried to \"persecute\" Bengali-speaking people, she said that the saffron camp should remain prepared for a fresh round of ‘Khela Hobey’ (the game-is-on slogan coined ahead of the 2021 state polls) during the Assembly elections in 2026.\n“I have decided to speak more in Bangla from now on, hold me in detention camps if you can,” she said while attacking the BJP.\nSenior leaders of the party, including TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, joined Banerjee as she led thousands of people in the march, which began from College Square in central Kolkata around 1.45 pm.\nThe march will terminate at Dorina Crossing in Dharmatala.\nThe nearly 3-km route was wrapped in security, with nearly 1,500 police personnel guarding the barricaded pavements and adjacent buildings.\nVehicular traffic was diverted along multiple arterial roads in the central parts of the city because of the programme.\nSimilar demonstrations have also been organised by the TMC in the district headquarter towns across the State.\nThe protests are being held a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to the State.\nAsserting that there are nearly 22 lakh migrant workers from Bengal working in other parts of the country, who have valid identity documents like Aadhar, EPIC and PAN cards, Banerjee said she would not tolerate any disrespect meted out to them on flimsy grounds.\n“What right does the BJP have in harassing Bengalis like this, even arresting them and forcefully pushing them back to Bangladesh? Is West Bengal not part of India?” she asked.\nStating that \"extreme situations call for extreme counter measures\", Banerjee said, \"I will say this in the simplest of words. We will not fight you physically. But if the BJP doesn’t put an end to its persecution policies immediately, then the Trinamool Congress knows how to make them stop.\""

Bindu has said that the government intends to implement the revised normalisation process for the KEAM State engineering entrance examination from the next academic year.\nThe proposed pattern had to be put on hold after the Kerala High Court annulled the original rank list published by the Commissioner for Entrance Examination, and instructed the government to revert to the previous normalisation method.\nWhile some students of the State Board challenged the High Court judgment in the Supreme Court, the State government decided against going in appeal, considering time constraints to complete the admission process.\nIn a statement, Dr. Bindu said the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) guidelines mandated that all admission procedures be completed by August 14. The State government, therefore informed the Supreme Court that a minimum of 30 days is required to complete the option registration and allotment process.\nThe State also informed the apex court that the government is willing to appeal against the High Court’s verdict, “which affected the implementation of the revised prospectus”, if the AICTE is open to modifying the current admission deadline.\nDr. Bindu reiterated that the government had proposed to implement the revised mark normalisation process to ensure justice for all students. The reforms were intended to rectify disparities and were accordingly incorporated into the amended prospectus, she said."

    "content": "The Kerala State Medical Council (Council of Modern Medicine) has decided to remove the name of a  registered medical practitioner from the State Medical Register for a period of three months and has imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh, for practising with unrecognised and unregistered qualifications, ignoring prior warnings and repeated directives of the council.\nThis is the second instance in recent times of the KSMC cracking the whip to ensure that all registered medical practitioners follow the ethical guidelines of professional conduct regulating the practice of medicine.\nThe complaint that Collin Alphonse, a registered medical practitioner in Thiruvananthapuram, was displaying unrecognised and unregistered additional qualifications while in clinical practice was received by the council in 2022. The Ethics Committee of the Modern Medicine Council had summoned Dr. Alphonse on June 14, 2022 for a personal hearing.\nDuring the hearing, the doctor said that though he had appeared for the DNB (Medicine) examination after training from 2007 to 2010, the result was not declared. He claimed that he obtained an MD in Medicine in 2016 and a PhD in Medicine in 2019 from Nicaragua, Central America. He claimed to have applied for an equivalency certificate from the National Medical Commission (NMC) and that the registration process had been initiated with the NMC.\nDr. Alphonse said he had  been practising at Jubilee Memorial Hospital since 2019 and asserted that he was unaware that unregistered qualifications should not be displayed for medical practice. He gave an undertaking to the council of corrective action and also tendered an apology.\nThe Ethics Committee, however, found that the claim that Dr. Alphonse had applied for an equivalency certificate was misleading, as the NMC does not issue such a certificate. The degrees displayed by Dr. Alphonse were not listed as NMC’s recognised qualifications and he had practised for three years using these qualifications.\nThe council imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on Dr. Alphonse and directed him to remove the unregistered qualifications from his name board, official seal, and prescription pads, and to submit documentary proof to the council.\nHowever, except for paying the fine of ₹50,000, Dr. Alphonse refused to comply with the rest of the directives, even after a reminder was sent to him. On February 22 this year, the KSMC, during a surprise inspection at Jubilee Memorial Hospital, found that Dr. Alphonse was continuing to practice, displaying the qualifications, MD (Medicine), PG in Diabetology, and FCCM (Critical Care in FC).\nThe council then issued a show cause notice to him, directing him to appear before the council. In his appearance on June 21, Dr. Alphonse blamed the hospital administration for including the qualifications on the board placed outside his consulting room.\nHe said that upon receiving the show cause notice he had instructed the hospital authorities to remove the unregistered qualifications from the name board. Dr. Alphonse, however, admitted that he was using the same qualifications in other areas  where he had clinical practice, “thinking that the instructions by the council applied only to the practice at Jubilee Memorial Hospital”.\nThe council, however, held Dr. Alphonse accountable  for repeatedly ignoring its directives and continuing his unauthorised practice even though he had paid a penalty for the same offence in 2022.\nThe KSMC on July 3, decided to remove his name from the State Medical Register for three months, noting that he had neglected his  professional responsibility to ensure accurate and lawful public representation. Dr. Alphonse was also directed to implement corrective measures; not to display unregistered qualifications and not to claim to be a specialist till he was duly qualified to do so.\nThe doctor has the right to appeal before the Ethics and Medical Registration Board of the National Medical Commission as per Section 30(3) of the NMC Act, 2019, and as per Clause 8.8 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002."

However, the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Cheetah Project Steering Committee will decide when the animals will be brought here,\" he said.\nMr. Singh said a 600-hectare enclosure has been developed, the herbivore population has been increased, and facilities such as CCTV monitoring and a dedicated veterinary centre have been established.\nFences have been installed to prevent the infiltration of other large carnivores into the cheetah enclosures. Veterinarians have also been trained at Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park, the first site in India to host cheetahs translocated from Africa, he added.\nAccording to the plan to introduce cheetahs in the Banni Grasslands, the natural habitat preferences of cheetahs in Africa include grasslands, savannahs and scrublands, and the habitat conditions in Banni closely match these.\nVantara, a Jamnagar-based rescue, conservation and rehabilitation facility of the Reliance Foundation, posted on Instagram that in collaboration with the Gujarat Forest Department, it has reintroduced spotted deer into the Banni Grasslands.\n\"The introduction of spotted deer marks a key step in restoring ecological balance in Banni. As a committed partner, Vantara supports this effort with scientific expertise, veterinary care and technical support, working alongside the government to protect India's natural heritage,\" it said.\nMr. Singh said the move is part of broader efforts to increase the prey population in the arid grassland landscape.\nOfficials said that cheetahs are likely to be introduced in the Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh before they are sent to the Bunni Grasslands.\nThe State government officially declared Veerangana Durgavati a tiger reserve in September 2023. Located about 20 kilometres from Bhopal, it spans 2,339 square kilometres and covers parts of Narsinghpur, Sagar and Damoh districts.\nAn NTCA team reviewed the preparations in the tiger reserve in June.\nThereafter, officials said, cheetahs will be introduced into the Bunni grasslands in Gujarat's Kutch district and then in the Shahgarh Bulge region in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan.\nThe 10 potential sites listed in the action plan for cheetah introduction are: Guru Ghasidas National Park in Chhattisgarh; Banni grasslands in Gujarat; Dubri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sanjay National Park, Bagdara Wildlife Sanctuary, Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary (now Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve) and Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh; Desert National Park and Shahgarh grasslands in Rajasthan and Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.\nSeventy years after cheetahs went extinct in India, the government launched the Project Cheetah to establish a sustainable population of the big cat in the country.\nAs part of the reintroduction effort, 20 African cheetahs were brought to Kuno National Park: eight from Namibia in September 2022 and 12 from South Africa in February 2023. Eleven of them have survived, including two that were transferred to Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary in April.\nSince the introduction of African cheetahs, 26 cubs have been born in India, of which 17 have survived."

Many crucial processes performed by the university, including the issue of equivalency certificates that are essential for student admissions, have come to a standstill.\nThere are reports that the mark lists of various examinations and files relating to the recognition or approval  of academic courses in affiliated colleges, the career advancement schemes for teachers, and that of additional Plan funds are all held up in various sections, which calls for urgent crisis resolution.\nThe government should remember that the petty power politics, violent protests and the escalating crisis in Kerala University and the higher education sector is affecting the academic prospects of students, Mr. Satheesan said.\nHe requested Mr. Vijayan to intervene in the matter urgently."

    "content": "Senior citizens in the Nilgiris have called for better accessibility to government offices, particularly the office of the Revenue Divisional Officers (RDOs) in Udhagamandalam and Coonoor, where grievances of senior citizens are heard.\nAccording to local residents who have visited the offices, both offices, where senior citizens’ tribunals are held, lack basic facilities for senior citizens, such as wheelchairs and disability-friendly ramps and stairs. D. Subbaiah, a resident of HPF in Udhagamandalam, aged 92, said he had approached the office of the Ooty RDO, first in November of last year, seeking help from the RDO to mediate between himself and one of his children for the construction of a toilet on his land. Mr. Subbaiah said that not only was accessing the office difficult, as it was located atop a hill along Hospital Road in Udhagamandalam, he was also made to wait six hours in the rain for his petition to be heard as the RDO was unavailable.\n“Moreover, the RDO himself rarely listens to our grievances, which are instead heard by clerical staff in his office. When we approach the appelate authority, who is the collector, we are treated very poorly by her clerical staff as well,” alleged Mr. Subbaiah, stating that in most cases, their grievances are not escalated to the collector or the RDO by the staff.\nVisitors to the RDO office in Coonoor too have similar complaints. A. Baby, 76, who lives in Balocola with her sister, said that she had wanted the RDO to intervene in receiving maintenance allowance from her brother.\nShe said that she was denied permission to meet the RDO and the collector on a number of occasions. A. Saroja, her sister, and a principal of a school in the Nilgiris, said that the procedure to assist senior citizens was designed in such a way as to discourage people from demanding their rights as per the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. “When I was helping my sister in drafting her petition at the collector’s office, I was told to step out of the office even when I informed them that she was illiterate,” alleged Ms. Saroja.\nK. Vijayan, a senior lawyer and Director of the People’s Legal Forum (Tamil Nadu Chapter), toldThe Hinduthat accessibility was an important issue, especially in a topographically challenging district such as the Nilgiris, where senior citizens and people with disabilities face even more challenges in accessing government services due to a lack of mobility. “The government needs to ensure that these offices are made accessible with wheelchairs and offices that are disabled-friendly. They could also consider delegating one official who will be present at all times to consider and help with drafting the petitions of senior citizens and persons with disabilities,” he said.\nWhen contacted, Revenue Divisional Officer (Udhagamandalam), S. Satheesh, said that it was unfortunate that the building in which his office is located was atop a steep incline. He said that no senior citizens are made to walk up to his office and that he receives them all on the ground floor itself. “We also have a dedicated day, each Thursday, where senior citizens and persons with disabilities have their grievances heard. They are also offered assistance by the District Legal Services Authority,” he added, stating that the district administration was working hard to ensure that the grievances of senior citizens are solved in a time-bound manner."

The bugs have been found in fields undergoing second season paddy cultivation, around 25 days after sowing.\nThe KCPM warns that the black bug, which sucks sap from plants, could damage crops and urges farmers to remain vigilant. The pest is typically found on leaves. It is also seen in the soil or at the base of plants. It injures leaves and midribs, causing leaves to tear off and midribs to wilt.\nWounds caused by the black bug might also facilitate the spread of bacteria responsible for leaf blight. In cases of severe infestation, symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and wilting of midribs might appear.\nOfficials suggest controlled flooding of fields to help destroy the pests. “If water is flooded to the extent that the base of the plants is submerged, the bugs will climb upwards. This prevents them from sucking sap from the lower parts of the plant. Furthermore, if the lower leaves remain submerged for more than six hours, the egg clusters laid on them will be destroyed. The bugs that climb upward will be eaten by birds and other natural predators. Predatory insects such as tortoise beetles also feed on and destroy egg clusters,” says an official.\nThe bug population usually increases in the days following the full moon. Officials say that insecticide application could be carried out in severely affected areas. “If large numbers of pests are found and symptoms appear on paddy plants, insecticides can be applied as per technical advice,” the official adds.\nIn fields practising organic farming, Azadirachtin 1500 PPM can be sprayed at the rate of one litre per acre. The pest population can also be controlled by applying biocontrol agents such as Metarhizium and Beauveria.\nIf the use of chemical insecticides is required, granular formulations are recommended. Granules can be applied along with chemical fertilisers. To ensure better results, optimum soil moisture should be maintained during application.\nFor more details, farmers could contact the following phone numbers: 8547865338 (Nedumudi), 9074306585 (Punnapra), 9961392082 (Kainakary) and 9567819958 (Champakulam)."

    "content": "Observing that what could be divine music to the ears of some might actually turn out to be a nuisance for others, the Madras High Court on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) restrained the use of a residential house for the recitation ofNama Sankeerthanam(congregational chanting of the names of Hindu Gods) unless the Collector grants permission for using the premises as a prayer hall.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh said, the law should apply equally to all, and that no religious group could use such premises for congregational prayers without the Collector’s nod. “Peace is the best prayer and silence is the greatest prayer. The day people realise this truth, they will not disturb others by indulging in loud and noisy ways of praying to God,” the judge said.\nThe observations were made during the hearing of a writ petition filed by Prakash Ramachandran of Krishnamachari Street at Radha Nagar in Chromepet, Chengalpattu district. The petitioner had complained that a private organisation named Global Organisation for Divinity (GOD) had opened its office on the residential premises belonging to his neighbour T.S. Subramanian.\nThe petitioner had complained ofNama Sankeerthanambeing recited on the premises, causing disturbance to other residents of the locality. However, the private respondents filed a counter affidavit claiming they had the consent of all the other neighbours for the recitation and that their religious rights had been safeguarded under Article 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution.\nThe private respondents also contended that uttering the names of Gods would only help in bringing peace of mind and serve as a remedy for all troubles and sorrows. However, the judge said, any prayer should remain confined within the four walls of a house and not end up causing disturbance to others. He also said, it was not necessary for all the residents in a locality to come to the court complaining about disturbance.\nReferring to an order passed by him restraining the use of residential houses for Christian congregational prayers in Kanniyakumari district without obtaining the Collector’s nod, the judge told the respondents’ counsel: “The same will apply here too. Except the change in the name of God, all other things are the same. How can you haveNama Sankeerthanamwithout Collector’s nod?”\nWhen the counsel stated her clients had already made a representation to the Chengalpattu Collector seeking permission, the judge ordered the recitation must not take place in the residential locality until the Collector grants permission and directed the Inspector of Chitlapakkam police station to ensure the court order was complied with in letter and spirit."

    "content": "From serving tea and noodles at a roadside stall to dreaming of summiting the highest peaks across all seven continents, Meghalaya’s Rifiness Warjri is charting a path of grit and grace.\nThe 20-year-old mountaineer recently etched her name in history as the youngest person from the state to conquer Mount Everest. But even with this extraordinary feat, Rifiness remains deeply rooted in her humble beginnings.\nIn an interview withPTI, Rifiness stood proud, yet grounded, as she shared her dreams of scaling the tallest mountains on every continent.\nHer journey has captured the hearts of many — not just for her physical endurance and mental strength but also for the humility and warmth she continues to carry. Eyeing the prestigious seven summits challenge, Rifiness hopes her path will inspire countless other women from struggling working-class families in small towns and marginalised communities to chase big dreams.\nBorn in Nongthymmai but now residing in the Laitkor area of the East Khasi Hills district on the outskirts of Shillong, Rifiness comes from a modest, hard-working family. Her mother runs a small roadside tea stall while her father sells chicken to support the family.\nDespite the national and international recognition she now receives, Rifiness is still often seen helping out at the family stall, wiping tables, serving tea, and chatting with customers, just as she always did.\n“It’s my home. My roots keep me grounded… the mountains teach us humility. When I stood atop Everest, I realised how small and insignificant we are. That was one lesson I brought back and I am sharing with everyone,” she said.\nDespite being a man of few words, her father Shlurbor Kharmyndai could not hide his pride.\n“It’s a proud moment for us. I wish that she secures a government job as soon as possible so that she can support the family as well, but I also do not want her to stop dreaming. She is free to fly big,” he said.\nHer elder sister, Noury, who co-manages the family tea stall, also spoke with emotion.\n“God has been kind to our family,” she said, smiling as she handed a cup of tea to a customer.\nAlso read:Hyderabad’s Vishwanath Karthikey Padakanti, the Youngest Indian to complete 7 Summits challenge\n“Seeing my sister reach the top of the world is like a dream come true. She worked so hard and deserves all this love and respect,” she added.\nThe Warjri family maintains a strong and loving bond. After the day’s work, they gather at home to share simple meals and talk about their day. Their evenings are often filled with laughter and music, with Rifiness and her sister strumming their ukuleles, singing soft melodies that echo through their home.\nRifiness’ journey to Everest was anything but easy. Meghalaya, though rich in natural beauty, lacks mountaineering infrastructure and organised support for adventure sports.\nSponsorship and funding are limited, especially for athletes, and mountaineering is not a popular sport in the state. But with unshakeable determination, intense training, and the emotional strength drawn from her family, Rifiness overcame every obstacle placed in her path.\n“I want to show young people, especially girls, that we can dream big and make it happen — even if we start small,” she said.\nFor children from disadvantaged families, she gave a message: “Your background should never limit your ambition. Believe in yourself and keep going.” Her climb has earned her recognition from across the nation. Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma felicitated her with cash rewards and acknowledged the significance of her journey for the state’s youth.\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh called her a shining example of India’s resilient young generation.\nThe Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) also honoured her after she symbolically handed over a piece of rock she carried back from Everest, connecting her triumph with the land and people she represents.\nBeyond the symbolic moments and celebratory ceremonies, Rifiness's aspirations are only just beginning. She dreams of continuing her mountaineering journey, aiming to conquer the seven summits, climbing the highest peaks on every continent, including Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Vinson Massif in Antarctica.\nEach climb will come with its own set of challenges, but Rifiness is no stranger to hardships.\n“I hope someday I will summit all these peaks, but right now I want to complete my BSc, which was stalled due to the training and travelling last year,” she added."

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) said the upcoming State Assembly elections would mark a permanent farewell to AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami, alleging that even members of his own party no longer trust him.\nMr. Stalin made the remarks while launching and inaugurating completed development projects and distributing welfare assistance in Mayiladuthurai district, during which he expressed criticism of both the AIADMK and BJP-led Union government.\nResponding to Mr. Palaniswami’s criticism of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, Mr. Stalin said, “He is unable to accept the scheme’s success. His criticisms only serve to advertise our achievements. We implement this scheme without bias; even women from AIADMK families benefit.”\nHe accused Mr. Palaniswami of reversing welfare progress during his tenure, pointing to the cancellation of the Moovalur Ramamirtham marriage assistance scheme and the free laptop distribution programme. “Mr. Palaniswami says ‘Tata, bye bye’ to me. But since 2019, the people of Tamil Nadu have been saying the same to him. In the upcoming elections, it will be a permanent goodbye,” Mr. Stalin remarked. “Even his own party cadres no longer believe in him.”\nTaking aim at Mr. Palaniswami’s outreach to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Stalin alleged, that the AIADMK leader had knocked on Delhi’s doors not for the people of Tamil Nadu but to escape raids and protect his family. “He mortgaged a party built by lakhs of cadre,” Mr. Stalin alleged.\nOn the issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen’s frequent arrests by Sri Lankan authorities, Mr. Stalin criticised the Union government for political inaction. “The BJP-led Union government has failed to act, while continuing to politicise the Katchatheevu issue. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister clearly said the Tamil Nadu fishermen are intruding into their waters and that Katchatheevu will never be returned. And what has our External Affairs Minister said in response? Nothing.” Mr. Stalin reiterated his demand for the Prime Minister to directly intervene and bring a lasting solution to the issue.\nMr. Stalin declared that the next government at the Centre would be a “Dravidian Model 2.0 government”, one that would serve as a national benchmark for inclusive and progressive governance.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Stalin unveiled a statue of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Vazhuvur village in Kuthalam taluk. He also held a brief roadshow near Dharmapuram, where he greeted school and college students as well as members of the general public."

    "content": "The sixth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB), organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation (KBF), will be titled ‘For the Time Being.’\nCurated by artist Nikhil Chopra with HH Art Spaces, a Goa-based artist-led organisation, the biennale will run for 110 days, from December 12, 2025, through March 31, 2026.\nThe KBF also announced the curatorial framework for KMB ‘25. Alongside the international exhibition, the biennale will feature a diverse programme of talks, performances, workshops, and film screenings, unfolding across various sites in Kochi. Key programme verticals include the Students’ Biennale, Invitations, Art By Children, the Residency Programme and the Collateral.\nThe curatorial note by Nikhil Chopra states that the sixth edition of the KMB will embrace process as methodology and position ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition.\nMoving away from the conventional biennale model of a singular, central exhibition event, the sixth edition is envisioned as a living ecosystem “one where each element shares space, time, and resources, and grows in dialogue with each other,” a release issued here said.\nKBF Chair V. Venu said the biennale, over its past editions, has consistently risen in stature, attracting artworks from both celebrated and emerging talents from India and abroad.\n“Organising such an event needs meticulous planning and strategies. We have introduced important organisational changes in the Kochi Biennale Foundation and we are confident to make a grand success of the sixth edition of the biennale. For both commoners and connoisseurs, it will offer a dynamic experience,” he was quoted as saying in the release.\nBose Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, said that Nikhil Chopra’s emphasis on durational exhibitions and performances will be a highlight of the sixth edition. “Those visiting the biennale will be introduced to an immersive atmosphere, featuring spectacular artworks and site-responsive installations. The event will also offer abundant opportunities to engage with artists and fellow art enthusiasts, and witness the layered cultural life of Kochi, a city where global and local currents converge and diverge all at once,” he said."

    "content": "CongressMP and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok SabhaRahul Gandhi, on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), saidAssamChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma will be in jail for “stealing people’s lands” and “large-scale corruption” after theBharatiya Janata Party(BJP) loses theState polls in 2026.\nAddressing a party rally at Chhaygaon, about 40 km southwest of Guwahati, he said the Congress would sweep the elections because of the BJP’s “politics of hate and violence”, and the groundwork done by theState party president Gaurav Gogoiand his team.\n“Soon, the media will show your Chief Minister going to jail and neither (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi nor (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah can save him,” Mr. Gandhi said.\n“When you go home and see him (Mr. Sarma) on TV, observe his eyes. They convey fear from the depths of his heart because he knows the Congress will put him in jail. He knows he will be answerable for the corruption he and his family have indulged in,” he said.\nReferring to a series of eviction drives across the State, Mr. Gandhi said the youth, farmers, and daily wage earners of Assam wanted to see the Chief Minister behind bars because “they know he is corrupt, and steals land from the people 24 hours a day for a solar park or resort”.\nThousands of acres of land had been taken from the poor, and farmers were being given to “Adani, Ambani, Ramdev” under one pretext or another, he said. “India’s forest, air, water, and land are being sold to five-six industrialists,” he added.\nMr. Gandhi also cautioned the people against possible manipulation of the electoral rolls ahead of theAssam election. “The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Election Commission of India are working in tandem to change laws and tamper with the voters’ list. They did it in Maharashtra, where one crore voters were added in four months; they are doing it in Bihar with the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls; they will do it in Assam,” he said.\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge also took a swipe at Mr. Sarma and exuded hope that the grand old party would return to power in Assam.\nRahul Gandhi wants to protect communal elements, alleges Himanta\nRahul terms Himanta Biswa ‘the most corrupt Chief Minister’ in the country\nHimanta Biswa Sarma, Rahul Gandhi spar; Assam Chief Minister warns Congress leader of arrest after polls\nEarlier, Mr. Gogoi said Mr. Sarma was acting like a “real estate broker” and engaging in large-scale land transfers to industrialists from outside the State. “The Chief Minister and his colleagues are dispossessing the poor and the marginalised. The Congress party in Assam will fight for justice for every citizen suffering under a regime of fear and terror,” he said.\nThe Assam Chief Minister hit back at Mr. Gandhi and his party colleagues. “He came all the way to Assam just to say this (jail for graft), conveniently forgetting that he himself is out on bail in multiple criminal cases registered across the country,” he wrote on social media platform X.\nA former Congress leader, Mr. Sarma has frequently engaged in a war of words with Mr. Gandhi since joining the BJP in 2015."

The government should not allow capitalists and corporate houses to acquire farmland, he said.\nThe Dharwad district committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), according to a press release from district secretary of the party Mahesh Pattar, has welcomed the State government’s decision on quashing the land acquisition notification pertaining to Devanahalli and thanked all the organisations that stood with the farmers in taking their fight against forcible land acquisition to a logical end.\nThe CPI(M) also thanked Samyukta Horata, Karnataka for providing the required force to the agitation to exert more pressure on the government.

We live in a parliamentary democracy where coordination between the State and the Centre is crucial for development.

I had requested the Centre then to consider it under the Sagarmala project as the estimated cost was ₹480 to ₹520 crore.

Palaniswami, alleging that even members of his own party no longer trust him.\nMr. Stalin made the remarks while launching andinaugurating completed development projects and distributing welfare assistance in Mayiladuthurai district, during which he expressed criticism of both the AIADMK and BJP-led Union government.\nResponding to Mr. Palaniswami’s criticism of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, Mr. Stalin said, “He is unable to accept the scheme’s success. His criticisms only serve to advertise our achievements. We implement this scheme without bias; even women from AIADMK families benefit.”\nHe accused Mr. Palaniswami of reversing welfare progress during his tenure, pointing to the cancellation of the Moovalur Ramamirtham marriage assistance scheme and the free laptop distribution programme. “Mr. Palaniswami says ‘Tata, bye bye’ to me. But since 2019, the people of Tamil Nadu have been saying the same to him. In the upcoming elections, it will be a permanent goodbye,” Mr. Stalin remarked. “Even his own party cadres no longer believe in him.”\nTaking aim at Mr. Palaniswami’s outreach to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Stalin alleged, that the AIADMK leader had knocked on Delhi’s doors not for the people of Tamil Nadu but to escape raids and protect his family. “He mortgaged a party built by lakhs of cadre,” Mr. Stalin alleged.\nOn the issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen’s frequent arrests by Sri Lankan authorities, Mr. Stalin criticised the Union government for political inaction. “The BJP-led Union government has failed to act, while continuing to politicise the Katchatheevu issue. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister clearly said the Tamil Nadu fishermen are intruding into their waters and that Katchatheevu will never be returned. And what has our External Affairs Minister said in response? Nothing.” Mr. Stalin reiterated his demand for the Prime Minister to directly intervene and bring a lasting solution to the issue.\nMr. Stalin declared that the next government at the Centre would be a “Dravidian Model 2.0 government”, one that would serve as a national benchmark for inclusive and progressive governance.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Stalin unveiled a statue of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Vazhuvur village in Kuthalam taluk. He also held a brief roadshow near Dharmapuram, where he greeted school and college students as well as members of the general public."

Madhav has asserted that the coalition NDA government in Andhra Pradesh will fulfill its mandate, with due focus on maintaining a fine balance between welfare and development, and is not averse to making the necessary course corrections, lest the people should lose confidence in it.\nIn a chit chat with print media journalists here on Wednesday, Mr. Madhav noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was extending all support to the State and wanted it to be mindful of the limited time at its disposal to implement what had been promised at the time of elections.\nMr. Madhav said the country was making rapid strides under Mr. Modi’s leadership, and it had a tremendous impact on Andhra Pradesh. This was evident from the manner in which the State recovered to a large extent from the misdeeds of the previous YSRCP government.\nWhile Mr. Modi extended the desired hand-holding (to AP), Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu managed to undo the damage that had been done by the YSRCP, one step at a time. Mr. Madhav expressed confidence that the State would undergo an unprecedented change in the remaining four years, as the TDP, BJP, and Jana Sena Party were making sincere efforts to achieve the purpose of their alliance.\nThe alliance was ridiculed by the YSRCP and some other parties for obvious reasons when it was forged, but the three ruling parties had set that mockery apart and were glued to the task on hand, which was to make Andhra Pradesh a progressive State, wherein a fair bit of success was achieved in the one year that passed by.\nThe State BJP chief further said the response to the coalition government’s style of functioning was evoking positive response from the public, but it was not taking things lightly as admiration could within no time turn into disenchantment if the parties failed to keep their promises.\nTherefore, the BJP, TDP and JSP were leaving no stone unturned to live up to the people’s expectations and gave priority to creating employment opportunities, which was one of the basic things for any political party to do. To achieve this, emphasis had been laid on attracting investments and the results were there for everyone to see.\nOn the political front, Mr. Madhav said, while following the coalition dharma, the BJP was building the organisational strength required to singly take on its rivals in the future.\nAdoni MLA Valmiki Parthasarathi, BJP State general secretary S. Dayakar Reddy, secretary N. Ramesh Naidu, NTR District president A. Sriram, and party leaders U. Srinivas Raju and M. Venkata Subbaiah was present."

    "content": "The State government has accorded administrative sanction to set up a ₹10-crore ring-fenced account for the restoration of the Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes, designated as Ramsar sites, for their ecological importance.\nThe move comes as a follow up to the ₹10-crore penalty imposed on the government by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal in March 2023 for its failure to check the indiscriminate pollution of the Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes.\nThe tribunal had directed the government to ring-fence an amount of ₹10 crore for undertaking conservation and restoration activities in the Vembanad and Ashtamudi wetlands. The drawing and disbursing officer of the Department of Local Self-Government has taken necessary steps to transfer the money to the specified account, said a government order dated July 9, 2025.\nOf the ₹10-crore fund, about ₹2.39 crore will be disbursed for projects under the Suchitwa Keralam (Rural) implemented by local bodies in the Ashtamudi–Vembanad wetland region as per the list furnished by the Executive Director, Suchitwa Mission. The remaining fund will be used for the biomining of legacy waste implemented by the Kochi Corporation in Brahmapuram, it said.\nThe tribunal had stated in its order dated March 22, 2023 that the environment compensation of ₹10 crore had to be utilised for conservation/restoration measures by preparing an action plan to be preferably executed within six months.\nIt would be open to the Chief Secretary to collect the amount from erring officers/departments/industries/ individuals in accordance with the law by an appropriate mechanism and hold erring officers appropriately accountable departmentally or by way of prosecution and also to proceed against other entities, railways, local bodies, and industries (responsible for the pollution) within three months, it said.\nThe penalty was imposed on the basis of the ‘polluter pays principle’ after the Bench observed that action taken at the State-level was also inadequate to remedy the situation. The State cannot plead helplessness in implementing guaranteed rights of the citizens and also in taking stringent measures for protection of environment and public health, it said."

The number of voters per booth needs to be revised from from 1,300 to 1,100 in the panchayats and from 1,600 to 1,300 in municipalities. Since each voter has to cast three votes, large numbers of voters per booth would create problems, Mr. Satheesan said.\nThere are also complaints that, even after delimitation, voters would be forced to travel more than eight km to access polling booths. The Commission should make arrangements for multiple booths in such locations, he said.\nThe UDF also demanded the Commission to rectify anomalies and guideline violations in the draft notifications on ward delimitation in local bodies."

Kote, T. Narasipur, and Periyapatna, a few months ago, the Minister added.\n“The Opposition claims the State has no money for development. If that is the case, how are these works being taken up? I can provide documents on the projects implemented and the amount spent,” he asserted.\nDr. Mahadevappa said no other government has brought such large-scale development, particularly to Mysuru city. “It is Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who has sanctioned maximum funds for the region,” he maintained.\nKey projects listed for the launch and laying foundation stones include ₹502 crore for white-topping and other works under PWD; ₹419 crore for an irrigation project at Heggadanahalli; ₹408 crore for underground electricity cabling by CESC; ₹330 crore for UGD works under Mysuru City Corporation; ₹192 crore for the Unity Mall at the exhibition grounds (State is providing only land to the Centre for the work), and ₹100 crore for new facilities at Mysore Medical College.\nHe said AICC president Mallikarjuna Kharge has been invited to the Samavesha.\nOn expanding K.R. Hospital with sharp increase in patient load, Dr. Mahadevappa said vertical development is possible only if building bylaws are altered, since high-rise structures are not permitted in the vicinity of the palace. “The bylaws are under consideration,” he replied.\nHe also acknowledged the increasing patient load at Jayadeva Institute in Mysuru, attributing it to lifestyle changes leading to rising health issues. The expansion of the facility will also be looked into, he added.\nFormer Minister and MLA Tanveer Sait, MLA K. Harish Gowda, Deputy Commissioner G. Lakshmikanth Reddy, Police Commissioner Seema Latkar, DCPs Sundar Raj and Bindu Rani, and local Congress leaders were present.\nEarlier, the Minister inspected the venue and spoke to the officials on the arrangements.\nDr. Mahadevappa said nearly one lakh people are expected to attend the event."

The Union Heavy Industries Minister is Sh. Kumaraswamy. They sold 160 acres earlier. On the remaining 280 Acres, the Karnataka Govt and Forest Department want to make a “Biodiversity Park”, like Cubbon Park, which will be a second set of lungs for Bengaluru,” he said.\nThe Congress leader alleged that the Modi government and Kumaraswamy want to sell these 280 acres of land for “real estate development”.\n“The Govt of Karnataka and the Modi Govt are fighting it out in Supreme Court and the matter is now listed for July. While Congress Govt of the State wants Bio-Diversity Park like the Cubbon Park, BJP-Janata Dal want real estate development,” he claimed in the post.\nHe questioned why the Modi government and Union Minister Kumaraswamy are obstructing and opposing creating a Bio-Diversity Park in the heart of Bengaluru.\n“For BJP-Janata Dal, is making money out of real estate more important than Green Cover and fresh air for people of Bengaluru? When land was given for factory in the 1960’s and HMT is shut down years ago, why should this land be not returned to People of Karnataka for a Bio-Diversity Park? Does this not expose the hypocrisy of Modi Govt and bring out the sinister nexus of BJP-Janata Dal?,” he asked."

But if any illegality is found, action will be taken, he said.\nOn the supply of fertilisers, he said that the Centre is not supplying adequate quantity of urea to the State as there is huge demand because of copious rainfall.\n“Already, four cases have been filed against supply of poor quality fertiliser. Their licence has been cancelled and steps will be taken to arrest sellers of spurious fertiliser,” he said.\nReplying to a query, Medical Education Minister Sharanprakash Patil clarified that there has been no increase in the number of deaths due to heart attacks in the last six months. “People have been given wrong information.

Saseendran has announced that the State will soon launch a project in collaboration with the Health Department to produce snake antivenom locally.\nInaugurating the World Snake Day observance here on Wednesday, he said the antivenom at present used in Kerala was sourced from Tamil Nadu. “Studies have shown that the potency of snake venom can vary from region to region due to atmospheric differences. As a result, antivenoms may not neutralise the venom of the same species found in different regions. Hence, locally produced antivenom is essential for effective treatment,” he said, emphasising the importance of region-specific antivenom.\nPointing out that between 82,000 and 1.35 lakh people die from snakebites globally every year, the Minister said nearly half of those deaths occurred in India. “Kerala has historically reported high snakebite fatality rates.”\n“However, efforts by the Forest department and the introduction of the SARPA (Snake Awareness, Rescue and Protection App) mobile application have significantly brought down the number of deaths. From 119 reported deaths in 2019, the figure dropped to 30 in 2024. The State aims to achieve zero deaths due to snakebites by 2030 as part of the Snake Envenomation Zero Mortality Kerala project,” Mr. Saseendran stated.\nHead of Forest Force Rajesh Ravindran presided over the programme. Chief Wildlife Warden Pramod G. Krishnan also spoke on the occasion."

The unions aired their views on the penultimate day of the public hearings organised by the commission on the draft.\nOver 70% of the solar power generated during daytime was being exported to the grid by prosumers, they said. The cost of having to accommodate this excess energy plays havoc with the KSEB’s scheduled power agreements and finances. A situation has now arisen where the gains made by the prosumer population of around 2 lakh are coming at the expense of the entire 1.4 crore electricity consumers of the KSEB, they said.\nThe unions welcomed the proposal to limit the net metering system to 3 kW, but called for more studies on new technologies such as peer-to-peer trading (P2P).\nObserving that Kerala’s solar capacity has grown by 275% over the past two years, the Left-backed KSEB Officers’ Association (KSEBOA) welcomed the commission’s efforts to encourage energy storage systems through the draft regulations.\nWelcoming the draft proposals, the KSEB Workers’ Association, affiliated to the CITU, called for constructive solutions to balance the requirements of the prosumers and ordinary consumers of the KSEB. The association, however, pointed out that there is a need to correct the propaganda that the draft is against the prosumers.\nThe Kerala Power Board Officers Federation and  the INTUC-backed Kerala Electricity Employees Confederation said urgent measures are needed to address the challenges posed by excess injection of solar power into the grid. At the same time, the new investors in the renewable energy sector needs to be encouraged.\nA demand was also made at the hearing that the commission set a ceiling on the cost of installing solar plants.\nThe series of public hearings held by the commission on the draft will conclude on Thursday."

    "content": "Traffic was disrupted at Aram Mile on the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway on Wednesday for nearly two hours after a tree fell on the road around 6 a.m. According to local people, the traffic was resumed after Fire and Rescue Services personnel removed the tree.\nLast week, the Kerala High Court issued an order restricting road-widening works and tree felling on the 14.5-km Neriamangalam-Valara-Adimaly stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway following a petition filed by Idukki-based environmentalist M.N. Jayachandran.\nDias Pullan, convener of the Idukki Land Freedom Movement, said that the people in the area had formed a National Highway Protection Council to provide immediate assistance in clearing traffic blocks caused by fallen trees and other issues. “Usually when the group comes to know about fallen  trees on the road, its members immediately rush to the site to clear the road. But after the court order, they have refused to join the initiative and the traffic on the stretch was disrupted for nearly two hours on Wednesday. People fear that if they remove fallen trees from the area, the Forest department will register cases against them,” said Mr. Pullan.\nIdukki Land Freedom Movement general convener Rasak Chooravelil said that in June, following an order issued by the Idukki District Collector, a team comprising the Valara Forest Range Officer and the National Highways Authority of India officials had identified 682 trees and two bamboo groves on the 14.5-km stretch that posed threat to passengers. Around 240 trees on the stretch had already been felled. However, after the High Court order, the tree-felling initiatives faced a hurdle. Repeated incidents of trees falling on the stretch pose a major threat to motorists on the Neriamangalam-Valara stretch,” said Mr. Chooravelil.\nMeanwhile, the National Highway Protection Council has decided to take out a long march from the premises of the Aram Mile forest station to the Neriamangalam forest range office on July 31 demanding an end to the “illegal interventions by the Forest department that hinder the widening of the highway.”\nAccording to organisers, various farmers’ groups and people’s movements will join the protest march."

Chandrababu Naidu was misusing power to harass the opposition party leaders and cadre.\nHe alleged that the DIGs in the State were indulging in corruption on behalf of the ruling dispensation. “Certain DIGs and police officers are behaving like mafia dons, collecting bribes from illegal liquor and sand operations, and sharing the proceeds with ruling party leaders,” the YSRCP chief alleged.\nHe accused the NDA government of resorting to authoritarian governance, misuse of police machinery, and suppression of opposition party leaders.\n“The YSRCP is the only party consistently responding to public grievances,” he said, and claimed that the remained the sole voice actively questioning the failure in delivering promises made by Mr. Naidu.\nMr. Naidu, having lost public trust, was misusing police powers to suppress dissent, he alleged. The government filed false cases against senior IPS officers such as P.S.R. Anjaneyulu, Sunil Kumar and Kanti Rana Tata, the former Chief Minister alleged.\n“Over 80 inspectors and hundreds of constables remain suspended or sidelined, while only pro-TDP officers are being empowered,” he said, and cited the resignation of IPS officer Siddharth Kaushal as an example of the “unbearable pressure being exerted by the government on honest officers.”\nCondemning the attack on Krishna ZP chairperson Uppala Harika allegedly by TDP workers while she was on her way to attend the ‘Recalling Chandrababu’s Manifesto’ programme, he said despite police presence, the mob attacked and hurled stones at her car. “Shockingly, no arrests have been made. A false case has been filed against her husband,” he said.\nMr. Jagan Mohan Reddy listed instances wherein false FIRs had been registered against the YSRCP leaders during his visits to mirchi yard and mango market, and condolence meeting in the recent past.\nHe questioned why raising public issues was being treated as a crime under the current regime. Despite borrowing ₹1.75 lakh crore in 14 months, the government failed to implement a single major welfare scheme, he alleged.\nReacting to cases filed on leaders and cadre who uttered controversial film dialogues, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy observed that there was nothing wrong in using film dialogues and expressions. “If they are so objectionable, then why did the Board of Film Certification allow such dialogues and expressions, and why did the film maker produce such movies? Let them stop it there itself,” he said."

    "content": "BJP MLA and former Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj is among five persons booked for the murder of a rowdy sheeter and realtor in Bengaluru on Wednesday.\nThe FIR was registered based on a complaint by Vijayalakshmi, the mother of the deceased, who reportedly witnessed the murder.\nShe said her son Shivaprakash, 44, had been facing life threats from the associates of the MLA over a property dispute since February 2025. Shivaprakash had complained about the same to the police. He was allegedly murdered by a gang of eight persons who were instigated by the MLA representing K. R. Puram. Mr. Basavaraj has been listed as accused number five in the FIR.\nAccording to Ms. Vijayalakshmi, around 8.10 p.m. on Tuesday, Shivaprakash, his driver Imran Khan, and a friend, Lokesh, were engaged in a conversation on the road in front of their house at Bharathinagar. When she looked out from the balcony on the first floor, she saw a group of unidentified assailants attack Shivaprakash. When Imran Khan tried to rescue her son, he was also attacked with lethal weapons. She saw Lokesh filming the attack on his mobile phone. She screamed for help. Seeing people rushing to the spot, the assailants fled. By then, her son Shivaprakash was dead, Ms. Vijayalakshmi said in her complaint.\nShe said Shivaparakash had been engaged in the real estate business, as part of Extreme Point (Promoters and Developers) Pvt. Ltd., for the past year. She said her son had got a general power of attorney (GPA) for a plot of land at Kothanur in 2023. He had built a shed and arranged for two women to live there as security guards.\nIn February 2025, two men — Jagadish alias Jagga and Kiran — had trespassed into the plot of land. They threw out the two women living there. Later, Jagadish called Shivaparakash, threatening to “not let him be alive” if he did not transfer the GPA to his name, as it “was his area”, Ms. Vijayalakshmi claimed.\n“My son had been complaining that he faced threats to his life from Jagadish, Kiran, Anil, Vimal, and K.R. Puram MLA Byrathi Basavaraj. He had submitted several petitions in this regard to the police,” she stated in her complaint.\nShe suspects that her son was murdered by these four persons at the instigation of Mr. Basavaraj.\nReacting to the development, Mr.  Basavaraj denied any involvement in the case and questioned the police actions.\nSpeaking to the media at Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday, Mr. Basavaraj asked, “Did the police take any information from me before registering the FIR? I have absolutely no connection with the murder. Suddenly, the police have filed a case against me. Can anyone file a complaint and get an FIR registered without verification?”\nHe further alleged political motives behind the move. “This could be part of a political conspiracy. I will fight this legally. I had no information whatsoever about the deceased. The police registered a case without even recording my statement. There’s a clear conspiracy behind this,” he said. Mr. Basavaraj maintained that he would cooperate legally and fight the allegations in court."

    "content": "Story so far:Jammu Kashmir Chief MinisterOmar Abdullah defied his Lieutenant-Governor‘s (L-G) stance on ‘Martyrs’ Day’, on July 13, 2025, to pay tribute to the 22 civilians killed by Dogra rulers in 1931. Visuals shared by Mr. Omar Abdullah show him grappling with the authorities as he visited the Naqsbandh Sahib shrine at Khawaja Bazar to offerfatiha(prayer) at the martyrs’ graves. The L-G had barred the government and regional parties from paying tributes at the site.\n“The unelected government tried to block my way forcing me to walk from Nawhatta chowk. They blocked the gate to Naqsbandh Sahib shrine forcing me to scale a wall. They tried to physically grapple me but I was not going to be stopped today,” posted Mr. Abdullah. Highlighting the July 13 massacre asJ&K’s ‘Jallianwala Bagh’, Mr. Omar Abdullah said, “True heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims.”\nThis is the physical grappling I was subjected to but I am made of sterner stuff & was not to be stopped. I was doing nothing unlawful or illegal. In fact these \"protectors of the law\" need to explain under what law they were trying to stop us from offering Fatihapic.twitter.com/8Fj1BKNixQ\nWhile Mr. Abdullah was able to visit the shrine, no other leader was able to do so. NC leaders such as Showkat Mir, Imran Nabi Dar, Shafqat Watali, Nasir Aslam Wani and Tanvir Sadiq were eitherdetained or put under house arrest.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, J&K Apni Party (JKAP) president Altaf Bukhari and and J&K Peoples Conference (JKPC) president Sajad Lone, were also detained in their homes or offices.\nBJP has refused to mark the event as a ‘martyrdom’, maintaining that the slain civilians were ‘rioters’ and not national heroes.\nHere’s a look at why J&K observes this day and its changed nature since 2019\nIn 1931, Kashmir was in turmoil due to a series of incidents that had led torevolt by the Muslims citizensagainst the ruling Dogra administration.\nOn July 13, 1931, when trial started in Srinagar, a huge crowd had assembled outside the jail, raising slogans to seeking Qadeer’s freedom. As the protestors urged the judge to imprison them instead, police began to hit them with batons. In retaliation, the crowds pelted the Dogra police with stones and sticks. On the Governor’s orders, police opened fire at the protestors killing 17 Muslims on the spot, while five succumbed to injuries later. The slain civilians were buried in compound of Kanqah-i-Maula, three days later. The spot has since then been renamed as Mazar-i-Shuhada.\nThe incident gave impetus to calls for Jammu-Kashmir’s freedom from Maharaja Hari Singh’s rule. The Reading Room party, founded by Sheikh Abdullah, established the Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference with the sole aim to protect Muslim rights. His demands for self-rule of the Kashmiri people too gained traction and a Legislature was set up by the Maharaja in 1934.\nIn 1947, after Maharaja Hari Singh fled to Jammu after acceding Kashmir to India, Sheikh Abdullah was appointed as J&K’s first Prime Minister. He declared July 13 as ‘J&K Martyr’s day’ and has been observed by consequent governments. Pakistan also observes the same day to honour Kashmiri civilian martyrs. Qadeer is believed to be born in Swat, which falls currently in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\nThrough the years, Martyrs’ day has seen ‘house arrest’ of Opposition leaders whenever the State has been put under President’s rule. In 1986, then CM Farooq Abdullah threatened to launch a fresh struggle if the Governor’s rule was not ended by September 7 that year. While most other Opposition leaders like G. M. Shah, Ghulam Nabi Kochak, Moulvi Abbas Ansari, Abdul Gani Lone were placed under ‘house arrest’, Dr. Farooq Abdullah and his ally, Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq, were allowed to pay tributes to the martyrs.\nBJP has never officially recognised or observed ‘Martyr’s day’, maintaining, “People killed then are those who broke the law and the State forces did what was required under the law. We neither believe in martyr’s day, nor do we approve it”.\nOn September 13, 1989, Kashmiri Pandit leader andBJP member Tika Lal Taploowas slain by Kashmiri militants. BJP and Kashmiri Pandits across India began observing September 13 as ‘Martyr’s Day’, holding rallies andshraads (death anniversary) to honour Taploo. Through the years, BJP has used this event to voice the concerns of the Hindu minority in Kashmir and the targetted attacks on the community by militants.\nIn 2015, when BJP allied with J&K People’s Democratic Party to form a coalition government, the saffron party ‘boycotted’ the July 13 Martyrs’ Day event — a first for a ruling J&K party. “The 1931 martyrs have no relevance for our party. If Kashmir-based political parties do not attend the functions we hold in memory of our leaders like Syama Prasad Mookerjee, why should we attend their Martyrs’ Day,” said BJP’s Kashmir spokesperson Khalid Jehangir. Since then, it has continuously boycotted the event.\nBefore Article 370 was abrogated in August 2019, then Governor Satya Pal Malik skipped the official state event, along with his Chief Secretary and four non-local advisors. Post-abrogation, the L-G has delisted ‘Martrys’ day’ as an official holiday and scrapped the event observing it.\nAfter the election of the Union territory’s first CM, Mr. Omar Abdullah, the ruling National Conference and other J&K parties this year, sought permission for their delegations to be allowed to visit the graveyard and pay tributes. However, the J&K Police denied permission to all regional parties to hold any commemoration functions at the graveyard.\n“The District Administration Srinagar has denied permission to all applicants intending to proceed towards Khawaja Bazar, Nowhatta on 13th July 2025 (Sunday). The General Public is hereby advised to strictly comply with these instructions. Any violation of these orders shall invite strict legal action under relevant provisions of law,” warned the police.\nAs politicians were put under house arrest, Mr. Omar Abdullah posted, “Today the unelected nominees of New Delhi locked up the elected representatives of the people of J&K. All to stop people from visiting a historically important grave yard containing the graves of people who laid down their lives to give Kashmiris a voice & to empower them,” echoing hurt sentiments of Kashmiri Muslims."

Ravindar Rao thanked NABARD for implementing innovative programmes at the grassroots level.\nRegistrar of Cooperative Societies Surendra Mohan told the gathering that the Telangana government accords top priority to rural development and development of women and farmers. NABARD has stood with the State government in modernising, revitalising and expanding the cooperative landscape. A total of 289 PACS in Telangana have been strengthened through refinance and infrastructure development, including the world’s largest grain storage project in Gambhiraopet PACS.\nNAFSCOB Chairman K Ravinder and State Bank of Hyderabad, Hyderabad Circle, CGM Radhakrishnan spoke. A booklet on Unit Cost that works as a handbook for bankers to decide the credit for various agriculture and allied activities, a report on the Impact Evaluation Study on Farmer Producers Organisations and a booklet on a-IDEA of NAARM were released."

    "content": "In what comes as a relief from the logjam created by the implementation of the December 2024 Supreme Court order, which mandated an occupancy certificate (OC) for getting utility connections, concerned departments have now decided to propose to the Cabinet to bring in amendments to multiple laws of the State and notify rules to mandate OC for only buildings built on plots above 1200 sq. ft (30X40 ft) across the State.\nThis essentially means all buildings built on sites larger than 30X40 feet will have to take an OC, henceforth, which was not the case earlier in Bengaluru. Following the implementation of the Supreme Court, over 1 lakh applications seeking new power connections have been pending in the Bescom area alone, for want of an OC. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar and Energy Minister K.J. George had said that the State government would soon introduce amendments to resolve the impasse.\n“The problem was that, in none of our governing acts are there clear exemptions to any buildings from OC. However, in practice, since the utility service providers were also not insisting on it, our urban local bodies were not issuing OCs to all buildings, but insisted on it only for bigger buildings. Legally, it has been a grey area. It is impractical to insist on OCs in all buildings, so there needs to be amendments to our laws to clarify which buildings are exempted,” said a senior official.\nThe Urban Development Department (UDD) and Panchayat Raj Department met with other stakeholders on July 11, minutes of which are available withThe Hindu. In the meeting, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suggested that buildings built on plots up to 1200 sqft (ground + 2 floors or stilt +3 floors) can be exempted from obtaining OCs. The Panchayat Raj Department also concurred with the same exemption.\nNeither the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, nor the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964, has any provision for exemption for any buildings from availing an OC. The meeting has decided to propose amendments to these laws to bring this change.\nMeanwhile, Section 241(7) of the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act, 2024 says: “Government may notify the category of building which shall be exempted from obtaining occupancy certificate”. The meeting decided to notify of the exemption for buildings built on plots up to 1200 sq. ft. The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department will also adopt the same exemption in its Model Building Byelaws."

    "content": "As Karkidakam, the final and most spiritually significant month of the Malayalam calendar, begins on July 17, thousands of devotees across Kerala are preparing for the sacred Nalambala Darshan, a unique pilgrimage that takes them to four temples dedicated to Lord Rama and his brothers, all in a single day.\nTraditionally viewed as a month of misery, marked by rain, disease, and hardship, Karkidakam is also revered for its spiritual richness. Believers turn to the Ramayana for solace and strength, often reading the epic throughout the month. It is said that sage Valmiki completed the Ramayana during this time. In this context, the Nalambala Darshan becomes more than a ritual, it is a symbolic journey of inner renewal and devotion.\nThe pilgrimage of Nalambala Darshan is taken to the Sree Rama temple, Thriprayar; Bharatha temple, Koodalmanikyam; Lakshmana temple, Moozhikulam; and Sathrughna temple, Payammal. The temples have made elaborate arrangements to receive devotees for the pilgrimage.\nThe pilgrimage begins at the Sree Rama temple in Thriprayar. The temple opens as early as 3.30 a.m., with devotees advised to complete their darshan before the early morning pujas begin at 5 a.m. Long queues are expected, but elaborate arrangements, including rain shelters, CCTV surveillance, mobile counters for offerings, and ample parking, ensure a smooth experience. Offerings like ‘kathina vedi,’ ‘meenoottu’ (feeding fish), and ‘avil nivedyam’ are part of the traditional rituals.\nNext is the Koodalmanikyam temple in Irinjalakuda, dedicated to Bharata. Devotees enter through the eastern gate, offer prayers, and exit through the western side. The devotees also make a circumambulation of the temple tank, Kulipini Theertham. The temple sees heavy footfall on weekends and offers rituals such as ‘tamara mala’ (lotus garland), ‘neyvilakku,’ and ‘pushpanjali.’ Free ‘kanji’ is served daily in the ‘oottupura.’\nFrom there, pilgrims head to the Moozhikkulam Lakshmana Perumal temple in Ernakulam district. This rare temple, where Lakshmana is worshipped, opens at 4.30 a.m. Devotees follow a specific prayer sequence, offering items like ‘palpayasam,’ ‘unniyappam,’ and ‘elluthiri.’ A massive shelter accommodates over 5,000 devotees, and ‘annadanam’ (free meals) is arranged for around 3,000 daily.\nThe final stop is Payammal Shatrughna Temple, located near Irinjalakuda. The temple opens at 5.30 a.m. and remains accessible till 9.30 p.m. depending on crowd flow. Special rituals like ‘Sudarsana pushpanjali,’ ‘chandanam charthal,’ and ‘shankhabhishekam’ are performed for the removal of obstacles and blessings of prosperity.\nInterestingly, the pilgrimage both begins and ends at Thriprayar, a full circle of devotion. As devotees walk this spiritual path, they don’t just traverse geography, they traverse the legacy of righteousness, loyalty, and dharma that the sons of king Dasharatha represent.\nThe Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is conducting special services for the devotees for Nalambala Darshan."

Mr. Bharath asked them to focus on developing parks and complete the repair works by August end. “Steps should be taken to repair the potholes without any delay. By the end of December this year, 30,000 saplings should be planted and officials should ensure their protection. The Secretariats functioning from community halls should be shifted to alternate places,” he instructed.\nHe then asked the officials not to delay the road extension works and to pay compensation to those who lose their land due to the extension.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bharath urged the people of Kurnool city to use the Puramithra App to notify officials of their complaints related to civic issues. He wanted them to send photographs through the app so that the officials could respond. “Download the app brought by the Municipal Administration Department and upload the photos of any civic grievance on it. The officials will visit the place within 24 hours and will try to rectify the problem,” he said, and added that people need not visit government offices to get their problems resolved. Complaints related to bad roads, sanitation, water supply, street lights and others can be uploaded."

    "content": "The Karnataka government’s decision to cancel the acquisition of land in Devanahalli for an aerospace park has led to a tug of war between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka over the future of the project, with Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh inviting the aerospace industry to his State and Karnataka Industries Minister M.B. Patil stating that there was no need to relocate.\nBoth Ministers spoke toThe Hinduafter a sharp exchange of comments on the issue on social media platform X.\nSpeaking a day after his post on the subject went viral, Mr. Lokesh, Andhra Pradesh Minister for Human Resource Development, Information Technology, and Real Time Governance, said that his invitation to industries in the aerospace sector was meant seriously.\n“I believe in States being competitive, and the offer was made in that spirit. We are actively thinking of reaching out to the aerospace industry to set up shop in Andhra Pradesh, we have over 8,000 acres to spare, and Anantapur is a good spot. Apart from Kia (South Korean automobile multinational Kia Corporation), we are actively looking at the renewable energy and defence industries sectors for that area. We are totally prepared to scale up the infrastructure required,” he said.\nResponding to Mr. Lokesh’s offer, Karnataka Industries Minister M.B. Patil categorically stated that the cancellation of the land acquisition in Devanahalli, after protests by farmer groups, did not mean the end of the aerospace project.\n“Out of the 1,700 acres that were earmarked, there are some people, with around 700 acres, who voluntarily came forward for land acquisition. Also, this is not the last parcel of land available in Karnataka. For the aerospace industry to prosper, elements apart from land are also crucial, which are available in Karnataka, like an ecosystem for defence-related industries to flourish. Karnataka provides 65% of the aerospace base in the country and is the third largest globally. Not even one industry will move out of Karnataka for want of land. I want to convey to Nara Lokesh that our waters are calm,” Mr. Patil said. “This morning itself I had a meeting with officials from an aerospace company and things are still on,” he added.\nThe land acquisition in Devanahalli was halted after 1,198 days of protests, with direct intervention by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in favour of farmers who did not want to give up land for industry and wanted to continue with agriculture. The aerospace park project envisaged a large space for the development of the sector.\nWhile the war of words has been on, the involvement of senior Ministers has a history behind it. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had, in a previous tenure as Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, managed to entice the team setting up the Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad, despite feelers from other States, by being proactive about the ISB team’s concerns over land and other issues at the time."

The Supreme Court has made it clear that Election Commission cannot determine people's citizenship. Does the Election Commission, by carrying out such an exercise now, intend to say that the electoral roll of 2014, when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, was fake?\".\nHe added, \"The same electoral roll was fine till last year's Lok Sabha polls. We fail to see a problem in conducting the upcoming assembly polls on the basis of the same voters' list.\"\n\"Obviously, the BJP is jittery in Bihar realising that the people here now have a new alternative in Jan Suraaj Party. So they are trying to wrongfully delete the names of voters. I would ask all people who face such wrongful deletions to contact our party. We will extend all possible help\", said the former political strategist.\nMr. Kishor, whose nine-month-old party is aiming to make a big dent in the state's Muslim vote base, also trained his guns at the RJD, which has so far been the first party of choice for the minority community.\n\"The RJD has treated Muslims as nothing more than the kerosene that could serve to keep the lantern bright. But the community has now had enough,\" said the Jan Suraaj Party founder, in an obvious reference to the main opposition party's poll symbol.\nReplying to a query, he said he saw \"no role\" in Bihar for the AIMIM headed by Asaduddin Owaisi, which had won a few seats in the 2020 assembly polls and has expressed the desire to contest the upcoming elections as part of the INDIA bloc.\n\"Bihar does not need to import leaders from Hyderabad,\" asserted Mr. Kishor, whose own party has decided to go it alone in the polls.\nThe IPAC founder, who has in his previous avatar handled election campaigns of several political parties across the ideological divide, was also asked about the Hindi versus Marathi row that has erupted in Maharashtra.\nBlaming the controversy on \"Thackeray brothers\", son and nephew of late Bal Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray, respectively, Mr. Kishor said, \"these people are lumpen elements. But the Congress and the BJP too have their share of the blame as these national parties have no qualms in tying up with such divisive forces.\"\nHe also alleged that Bihar BJP president Dilip Jaiswal has indulged in corruption and favouritism in his capacity as one of the trustees of Kishanganj-based MGM Medical College and challenged the latter, a sitting MLC and former State Minister, to initiate legal action \"if what I am saying is wrong\"."

    "content": "A Climate-Resilient and Energy-Efficient Agriculture (CREEA) report, a State‑wide roadmap shaped by 14 district workshops and consultations with experts from 16 departments (ranging from Agriculture to Power and Disaster Management), was released here on Wednesday.\nThe exercise, steered jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Energy Management Centre (EMC) under the Power department, and climate-policy organisations Asar Social Impact Advisors and Equinoct, charts how Kerala can protect crops, livelihood, and food security as extreme weather tightens its grip on the ₹56,000‑crore farm economy of the State.\nThe CREEA framework has been prepared against the backdrop of the climate crisis and its impact on the food system in Kerala. Around 94% of Kerala’s cropped area has already been categorised as climate-vulnerable, with loss in paddy and banana cultivation rising by 28% since the 2018 floods, according to the State Agriculture Directorate data.\n“Further, farm power use has doubled in a decade alone. The report outlines pathways to cut on-farm energy demand by up to 40% through solar pumps, biogas, and precision irrigation. By reducing production cost, improving soil health, and promoting biodiversity, CREEA will fortify rural livelihood against price and climate shocks,” says agricultural scientist S. Usha, the lead author of the report.\nAgriculture Minister P. Prasad unveiled the report at a farmer-scientist consultation, while Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty opened a technical dialogue on its recommendations. “CREEA is more than a study; it is a blueprint for an inclusive, low-carbon farm economy that keeps smallholders at the centre of climate action,” Mr. Prasad said.\nThe ideas highlighted in the report include forming K-CRAIL (Kerala Climate‑Resilient Agriculture Innovation Labs) at 941 panchayats in phases. The farmer-led “living labs” at panchayat, block, and district levels will trial bio-inputs, micro-irrigation, and resilient cropping systems.\nThe report also suggested forming farmer seed and bio-resource networks, AI-powered risk-mapping platform, low-carbon mechanisation drive, and supporting small and marginal farmers through targeted subsidies.\nAn inter‑departmental CREEA steering task force will be notified this quarter to finalise a three‑year implementation plan. Pilot K-CRAIL labs are slated for launch in Alappuzha, Palakkad, and Wayanad by early 2026.  The EMC will draft an investment prospectus to channel public-private finance into low-carbon mechanisation and AI-enabled advisory services."

The ratio of school dropouts has increased. Maternal and infant mortality are being reported frequently. Migration of rural people to big cities for livelihood and child marriage have become unsolved issues. The officers of the departments concerned should extend coordination to each other in solving the problems with immediate and effective steps,” Mr. Naik said.\nMr. Naik, who is the chairman of the DISHA committee under which three Assembly constituencies, Yadgir, Shahapur and Shorapur, fall, said that Agriculture Department officers should hold programmes for farmers to make them aware of using nano fertiliser which is being treated as an alternative to urea and DAP.\nHe specifically advised the officers to create necessary awareness among farmers about sprinklers, soil tests and also, having their cards.\nThe MP suggested finding solutions for problems that arise in implementing bypass roads for Yadgir and Shahapur cities and the Hyderabad road from Ramsamudra village via Gurmitkal and the Surat-Chennai Express Highway, as farmers have raised entry and exit issues through it to their farmland.\nHe added that the officers of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Karnataka Industries Area Development Board (KIADB) jointly solve the issue involved in laying pipelines to supply water from the Krishna river to the Railway Coach Factory at the Kadechur-Badiyal Industrial Area under the National Highway that passes near the area.\nMLAs Sharanagouda Kandkur and Raja Venugopal Naik raised some issues in implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission, Jaladhare, identifying a place for Akka Cafe and Indira Canteen and schemes sponsored by the Union government.\nDeputy Commissioner Harshal Boyar, Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat Lavish Ordia, Superintendent of Police Pruthvik Shankar and officers were present."

Narasimha, instead, issued notice to the State and the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations on a petition challenging the High Court decision.\nThe High Court had directed Kerala to revert to the standardisation formula followed in the original prospectus of KEAM 2025.\nThe apex court listed the next hearing after four weeks. The court did not budge even though petitioners requested an earlier date of hearing for the reason that admission procedures would be over by August 14 as per the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) deadline.\nMeanwhile, the State of Kerala informed it was not filing an appeal against the High Court order. The top court had, on July 15, asked Kerala to revert on whether it planned to file an appeal.\nAppearing for Kerala, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta said the State proposed to implement the necessary reforms in KEAM’s standardisation formula the next year in order to level any bumps in the playing field between CBSE and State syllabus candidates.\n“We propose to make the change next year,” Mr. Gupta said.\nAppearing for a group of CBSE students who had filed a caveat in the case, senior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph said the State must also reflect on why State syllabus students were lagging behind their CBSE counterparts year after year.\n“Perhaps they need to have a relook of the curriculum. There has to be an introspection by Kerala and other States,” Mr. Ramachandran said.\nAdvocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., representing the State syllabus students who appealed against the High Court order, countered that the State’s decision to amend the standardisation formula was a result of such an “introspection”. The amended formula had been devised to end the disparity between CBSE and State syllabus candidates for KEAM.\nThe State had constituted the Standardisation Review Committee in April after exam authorities had flagged that the 1:1:1 ratio for marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry gave CBSE students an unfair advantage over the State Board students.\n“This had meant the State students would see their marks drop while the CBSE students would have their marks soar,” Mr. Bhushan said.\nOn July 1, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, had decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025 to 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. It had gone on to publish the KEAM rank list the very same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court had directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus.\n“The State government was entirely within its right to make the amendment. It was done on the basis of a report by an expert committee. The High Court had intervened despite a consistent stand by this court to not intervene in policy matters unless they were found to be arbitrary or discriminatory to students,” Mr. Bhushan argued.\nMr. Gupta said the State was entirely with Mr. Bhushan on merits, and assured reforms for next academic year."

The selected students, mostly from Arab countries, Africa and Sri Lanka, will be admitted to undergraduate and postgraduate programmes including BA, BCom and MA.

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh IT Minister Nara Lokesh has drawn flak from farmers’ organisations in his State forextending an open invitation to the aerospace industry to Andhra Pradeshwith an offer of 8,000 acres of ready-to-use land.\nMr. Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, had put out an open invitation to the aerospace industry on social media on Tuesday in a bid to take advantage of theKarnataka government shelving the process of acquisition of 1,777 acres of farmland in Devanahalli taluk,near Bengaluru international airport, for the proposed defence and aerospace park, following stiff resistance from farmers.\nFarmers’ organisations in Andhra Pradesh termed his promise of providing 8,000 acres of land just outside Bengaluru as “inappropriate” and the struggle by Karnataka’s Devanahalli farmers demanding shelving of land acquisition as “historical”.\nIn a statement, Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao, convener of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers’ Associations’ Coordination Committee and Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s Andhra Pradesh unit, said, “Farmer organisations of Andhra Pradesh strongly object to this highly inappropriate statement. Without the consent of the farmers in the Lepakshi Knowledge Park area and without paying the legally mandated compensation under the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, the government has no authority to give away farmers’ land.”\nMr. Rao, who had earlier served as Agriculture Minister in the Chandrababu government, defended the demand by Devanahalli farmers to shelve the land acquisition. “The proposed land acquisition has been strongly opposed by local farmers in a historic struggle. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, respecting the farmers’ demands, announced the withdrawal of the proposal.”\nMeanwhile, Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya has drawn the ire of farmers’ leaders from Karnataka for endorsing Mr. Lokesh’s statement by posting on social media that “this is how business is attracted, industry is welcomed and jobs are created. Hope Karnataka Government learns from Nara Lokesh Garu and correct its course.” Mr. Surya deleted his post later.\nObjecting to this, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Badagalapura Nagendra made it clear that farmers were not opposed to industrialisation, but were against acquisition of fertile farmland for industrial projects.\nQuestioning the logic of Mr. Surya, he said: “The farm sector continues to be the biggest employment generator in the country as it engages nearly 60% of the country’s population. There is a dire need to protect the farm sector too.”\nMr. Nagendra referred to the impact of losing green spaces around Bengaluru and said that there is increasingly not even adequate water to take care of the city’s growing needs.\nKRRS (Collective leadership) president Chukki Nanjundaswamy too took exception to Mr. Surya’s statement and maintained that agriculture and development are not contradictory. “Development does not mean only industrial development. Development of the farming sector is also development,” she said, opposing the view that heeding the demand of farmers to drop acquisition of their fertile and productive farmland for an industrial project, would not make a business sense."

    "content": "Snakelets of Spectacled Cobras are keeping the volunteers of Friends of Snakes Society (FoSS) in Telangana busy this monsoon.\nThe eggs of this snake species hatch from June through September. Over2,970 out of the 5,954 snakes rescued by the Society,from January to June,were Spectacled Cobras. And 1,134 more were rescued from June to July 16.\nAround a week ago, a volunteer with the Society, Aditya Srinath, spent over 12 hours to rescue 23 snakelets and an adult Spectacled Cobra in Jagadgirigutta. These reptiles were found slithering in and out of a small crevice in the concrete floor between the house and a compound wall.\nMr. Srinath said that the floor was hollow and that provided an ideal space to lay eggs. “I reached there at around 7 p.m. and rescued 19 snakelets till 3 a.m. I returned the next day and rescued the remaining five,” he said.\nThe mating season of Spectacled Cobras is from January to April and they lay eggs from March to July, said Chelmela Srinivasulu, professor at Department of Zoology, Osmania University and Director, Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies. The incubation period is 45 to 70 days. “August is the peak hatching period,” he said.\nThough the monsoon has set in, rains have not been intense. Avinash Visvanatham, general secretary of the Society said that when human movement is not restricted due to less rains, people increasingly spot snakes.\nP. Gowri Shankar, founder trustee ofKalinga Foundation,a non-profit research organisation, said that monsoon offers multiple ways of survival such as abundant frogs, toads, rodents, and insects, ensuring food availability for the young.\n“Dense monsoon vegetation offers them shelter and concealment from predators and reduces exposure. The high-humidity monsoon environment prevents hatchling desiccation, vital during their early vulnerable phase. When many hatch at once, predator risk is distributed, reducing per-individual threat,” said Dr. Gowri Shankar, a wildlife biologist who has been studying King Cobras and other snakes for close to two decades."

    "content": "Opposing the State government’s proposed plan to acquire agricultural lands at Karedu village of Ulavapadu mandal in Prakasam district for the Indosol Solar Private Limited’s solar module manufacturing plant, the members of Human Rights Forum (HRF) and Rashtra Cheneta Jana Samakhya (RCJS) demanded to immediately call off the project.\nThe State government has already released multiple notifications to acquire the farm lands at Karedu and other villages. On Wednesday, they campaigned along with the villagers against the land acquisition of more than 8,500 acres in various villages for the proposed project. They addressed street meetings and distributed pamphlets to the local people.\nAddressing the public, HRF Sate general secretary Y. Rajesh and secretary G. Rohith said that the State government is unnecessarily acquiring such a large extent of land when a fraction of it is enough for the project. They also pointed out that the government is facilitating a company that has no track record in taking up such a big project.\nDuring the campaign, RCJS president M. Mohan Rao alleged that the government had taken an undemocratic decision to waive off the consent and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) requirements of the project. “The legal standing of this waiver is on shaky grounds, given that such waiver can only be done in the public interest. Except providing gains to a private company, one is hard pressed to find any public interest in this project. This proposed project involves silica processing, which has been established as highly toxic and polluting,” he said.\nThe HRF and RCJS members questioned the government‘s largesse to Indosol Solar Limited to the tune of around ₹45,000 crore, which is a staggering 60 per cent of the total proposed investment. The alleged it as socialising costs and privatising profits to a private company.\nEarlier, farmers from Karedu met former Chief Minister and YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at the party’s central office in Tadepalli on Tuesday. They had submitted a request letter seeking his support in protecting their agricultural lands at Karedu from industrial use.\nThe farmers expressed strong opposition to the government’s decision to allocate these lands for the project and explained that the area supports two crops a year and sustains thousands of farming and fishing families. They are afraid that the industrial takeover would threaten their livelihood and disrupt the local environment."

Despite being a major one, the K.R. Hospital lacked an RO plant and water was being supplied in cans, the quality of which cannot be assured.\nMr. Krishna said that a notice was served against the contractor of one of the hospital kitchens he visited, where the food provided to patients was not in accordance with the fixed menu. “If the contractor fails to comply with the norm and quality of the food, the contract will be cancelled and a fresh one will be provided,” he warned."

(SHCIL) on the e-stamping transactions that added substantial cost to the process. The SHCIL had been appointed as an intermediary in 2008 for vending e-stamps.\nThe draft of Karnataka Stamps (Digital e-stamp) Rules, 2025, was notified on July 14. Once implemented, it will not only replace traditional stamp papers with entirely digital stamping but also align with sustainability goals, making the process paperless. “The new module is expected to be implemented before the month-end,” Revenue Department sources said.\nThe new module will replace the e-stamping system, which was launched in 2008 to prevent fraudulent practices in stamp paper-based registrations and transactions. Incidentally, the e-stamp was introduced as a fallout of the fake stamp paper racket run by counterfeiter Abdul Karim Telgi, whose alleged multi-thousand-crore worth fraud also shook Karnataka politics in the early 2000s. The department had also started work on e-stamping in 2006.\nThe new module will also encourage registration of approximately three crore optionally registrable documents that are processed annually. These documents are not in an audit trail, creating significant gaps in accountability and revenue tracking, according to a department note.\nAmong other perceived benefits, which will be introduced in phases, are the template-based deed writing that enables users to draft deeds directly on the portal using customisable templates, ensuring standardisation and accuracy. This will also secure Aadhaar-based e-signatures of all the parties involved, ensuring authenticity and validity. While it allows direct payment integration with the treasury, the new system also secures digital storage of stamped documents, eliminating the need for physical storage."

    "content": "Auto aggregator platform Namma Yatri has come under criticism from commuters after it began charging the newly revised autorickshaw fares a fortnight ahead of the official implementation date announced by the government.\nThe fare hike, announced by the Bengaluru Urban Regional Transport Authority (RTA) on July 14, is scheduled to come into effect from August 1. The revised structure raises the base fare for the first 2 km from ₹30 to ₹36, and the per-km rate beyond that from ₹15 to ₹18.\nHowever, several commuters noticed that Namma Yatri, which claims to be a driver-first platform supported by autorickshaw unions, had already begun implementing the new rates from July 15 itself, a day after the official announcement.\nSiddharth Kumar, a resident of Arekere on Bannerghatta Road, was surprised to see the revised fare while booking a ride on the night of July 15 from M.G. Road. “The fare breakup in the app showed ₹36 for the first 2 km and ₹18 per km after that, even though the new fares are supposed to be implemented from August 1. This is unethical and amounts to misusing the fare hike to overcharge customers. Namma Yatri started as an honest initiative by drivers, is now behaving like any other aggregator,” he said.\nAnother commuter, Priya R., who frequently uses autos for her daily office commute in Indiranagar, shared a similar experience. It’s disappointing that a platform built by drivers for the people would jump the gun and disregard official timelines. It raises questions about accountability,” she said.\nAdding to the confusion, the app also showed a waiting time charge of ₹1.50 per minute after 3 minutes, while the RTA’s official notification allows a free waiting time of 5 minutes, followed by a charge of ₹10 for every 15 minutes.\nWhen contacted, Shan M.S., co-founder of Namma Yatri, clarified that the revised fare display was not a full rollout but part of a limited pilot. In an email response toThe Hindu, he said, “We would like to clarify that the new fare policy displayed on the app from July 15 was part of a limited pilot to test system readiness and gather driver-citizen feedback ahead of the official implementation.”\n“However, Namma Yatri will adopt the revised fare structure strictly as per government directions (starting August 1). Until then, we continue to follow the prevailing auto fare structure notified by the Government of Karnataka,” he said.\nThe early rollout, even if termed a pilot, has raised concerns about transparency and consistency in fare implementation.The Hinducontacted Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha regarding this issue; however, he did not respond."

    "content": "Employees of all four State Road Transport Corporations (RTCs) in Karnataka have announced that they will go on an indefinite strike from August 5, halting bus services across the State. The Joint Action Committee of Workers’ Unions made the announcement, citing the government’s continued neglect of their long-pending demands.\nIn a letter to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the unions criticised the government for ignoring transport workers’ grievances, including the release of pending arrears, pay revision, and timely promotions. “Despite repeated calls for strikes, the government only holds meetings and promises resolutions in a few days or months, but nothing changes,” said H. V. Ananth Subbarao, president of the KSRTC Staff and Workers’ Federation.\nAmong their key demands, the unions have sought an increase in various staff allowances, improved medical facilities, and regularisation of drivers and technical staff currently hired on a contract basis. They have also urged that only permanent corporation drivers be deployed to operate electric buses, not contract staff.\nThe union leaders argued that transport workers had played a vital role in implementing welfare schemes like the ‘Shakti Scheme’, which has generated goodwill and revenue for the government. “Despite our contribution, the government has completely ignored us,” Mr. Subbarao said."

    "content": "The golden visa schemes that are being introduced by several countries including the United Arab Emirates is a response to the  currently prevailing sense of global uncertainties, said a leading immigration specialist. Speaking toThe Hinduin New Delhi on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Andri Boiko, Dubai-based immigration specialist and entrepreneur said pandemic, conflicts in West Asia and Ukraine, U.S. President Trump’s orders on U.S. citizenship rules and attraction of tax relief among high net worth individuals in the Global South are reshaping the immigration landscape of the world.\n“United Arab Emirates has started the golden visa scheme that will give ten year visa for high net worth individuals and for individuals with extraordinary skills from India and other countries. Argentina is also expected to start the golden visa scheme later this year,” said Mr. Boiko, explaining that the way global immigration rules are being redefined against the background of the tough changes that are being introduced by the U.S. administration.\nPresident Trump on January 20 issued Executive Order 14160“denying citizenship to persons born from a mother who was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) at the time of said person’s birth”. The order has been at the centre of a fierce debate and has been challenged in the court putting a question mark on the citizenship status of many U.S. citizens.\nMr. Boiko, who started ‘Garant In’ in 2009 as a citizenship and residency advisory service in Dubai, said changing rules and taxation are pushing more and more high achievers to find safe locations where they can ensure safety of their finances and conduct business without hindrance.\n“The UAE’s golden visa will give high net worth investors and high achievers from India and other countries the edge of Dubai while they will continue to be based in India,” said Mr. Boiko, adding, “You can get the golden visa without surrendering Indian passport and this will increasingly become a trend worldwide”.\nMr. Boiko pointed out that while some countries in the West are cracking down on illegal immigration from the Global South, there also some western countries especially Portugal, Italy, France in Europe who want to welcome high net worth individuals from major countries in the Global South. “Taxation, future security of finances and investment into the next generation, status symbol, are also among the reasons that are prompting high net worth people from the Global South to explore possibility of becoming a long term resident of a country like Italy and France,” said Mr. Boiko."

A single-room construction, used as Thottapura (explosives store) by the erstwhile Travancore kingdom, is the latest Raj-era buildings to fall into disrepair in the district.\nThe building is believed to have been constructed during the period of Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, who ruled Travancore as regent. The primary purpose of the construction was to store the explosives required for the construction of temples and the Kottayam-Kumily (KK) Road. The building is believed to have been constructed around 100 years ago using stone and ‘surkhi.’ A magnet was fixed on the building’s roof to protect it from lightning.\nThe building, covered by the roots of a banyan tree, has been in a dilapidated condition over the years. Recently, the roots started to wither, resulting in sudden damage to the building. On Tuesday, it collapsed. Residents have demanded measures to safeguard the historical structure.\nThe Thottapura, covered by roots of a banyan tree, a year ago. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\nA few Raj-era buildings still remain in the Peerumade hills. The 130-year-old Kuttikkanam Palace, also known as Ammachi Kottaram, is one such.\nAccording to Tourism department sources, if the ownership of such historical buildings is given to the department, it can include the sites in heritage tourism projects and ensure the protection and historical worth of such buildings. Buildings such as the Thottappura would help educate the younger generation about our past, said a Toursim department official."

It is likely to submit a detailed report addressing all pending issues, including projects under construction, newly proposed projects, and the management of existing ones on both the Godavari and Krishna rivers and their tributaries, informed Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy in New Delhi on Wednesday.\nDuring a press briefing after a meeting with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on water issues in New Delhi, Mr. Reddy termed the decision to constitute a committee as the first step in their efforts to resolve all water disputes between the two States.\n“We will take a final call on any issue only after the committee submits its report,” he said, stressing the need to honour the report.\nReiterating his government’s commitment to resolving all issues related to water sharing with Andhra Pradesh, the Chief Minister said that they were trying to find permanent solutions to all the disputes. He, however, clarified that the issue of the controversial Godavari-Banakacherla project proposed by Andhra Pradesh had not come up at the meeting, as it was not on the agenda.\nIn response to a query about the legal binding nature of the decisions taken at the meeting, Mr. Reddy said that the Jal Shakti Minister C.R. Patil had facilitated the meeting on behalf of the Union government, but it does not have any legal binding on either State. “However, the decisions taken at the meeting must be honoured,” he added.\nAccusing the previous governments in both States of failing to resolve these issues, he alleged that Opposition parties had wished for the failure of the meeting for political gain. “But we have successfully arrived at four key resolutions — constitution of a committee, installation of telemetry equipment at all drawing points under the Krishna River, location of offices for both the Godavari River Management and Krishna River Management Boards, and repairs and rehabilitation of the Srisailam Dam, which is showing signs of damage,” he added. Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy also addressed the media."

During the meeting, Mr. Satyanarayana lauded their role in villages, claiming that they save people’s money by providing basic treatment and even minor surgical intervention. He said, “In earlier days, people without medical qualifications have done a lot of service to people.”\nTo these remarks, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Telangana Junior Doctors’ Network issued a response, stating, “Such statements are not only misleading and medically unethical but also pose a direct threat to public health, especially in rural and underserved regions. At a time when the medical fraternity is working to improve healthcare delivery and public trust, these remarks undermine both the law and the efforts of qualified professionals.”\nEchoing similar sentiments, the Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA) called the remarks shocking and highly irresponsible, especially coming from someone who belongs to the medical fraternity.\nThe Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA) also condemned the MLA’s comments, saying, “The blatant endorsement of quackery by an elected public representative poses a grave threat to public health and constitutes a serious breach of medical ethics by undermining the credibility and safety of the healthcare system.”\nAll the associations have demanded a public apology from the MLA and called on the Telangana government to issue a clarification reaffirming its commitment to curbing quackery in line with National Medical Commission (NMC) guidelines."

    "content": "The Thiruvananthapuram international airport has commissioned its open access fuel farm and aircraft refuelling Facility, a move poised to redefine operational efficiency and sustainability standards in the aviation sector of the country. An open access fuel farm is a common fuel storage and supply system that allows multiple oil marketing companies to provide aviation fuel through a shared infrastructure.\nAirlines benefit from greater choice and competitive pricing, while the system eliminates infrastructure redundancy, enhances safety, and supports sustainability goals by reducing emissions from fuel transportation and handling. The newly commissioned facility has been developed through the strategic acquisition of existing assets from multiple oil marketing companies (OMCs) operating at the Thiruvananthapuram airport.\nIn the next 24 months, under the open access, the airport will also unveil a state-of-the-art large jet fuel storage facility featuring a unique hydrant refuelling system, which will enable faster, safer, and more streamlined aircraft refuelling, said a statement from the airport here on Wednesday.\nThe model will enhance the competition as the new entrants among fuel marketers can now access the airport without infrastructure investment barriers. A shared infrastructure system eliminates duplication and ensures lower cost of operations for all stakeholders. The hydrant system also reduces turnaround time, enhancing overall airport throughput, reducing the refuelling time drastically.\n“The launch of the open access fuel farm is a cornerstone in our vision to transform the Thiruvananthapuram airport into a future-ready aviation hub. This facility exemplifies innovation, operational excellence, and our commitment to supporting a greener and more efficient aviation ecosystem,” said the statement.\nThe open access fuel farm positions the Thiruvananthapuram airport among the few airports in India adopting progressive fuel infrastructure models, paving the way for increased airline choice, market competitiveness, and improved environmental performance."

    "content": "Researchers at Kerala University have unearthed vital historical data that sheds new light on the 1859 Carrington Event, one of most intense geomagnetic storms.\nDrawing from long-overlooked magnetic logs preserved at the historic Thiruvananthapuram Astronomical Observatory, the team has decoded hidden clues that could reshape the understanding of solar mega-storms and their future threat to modern civilisation.\nThe Carrington Event, triggered by a colossal solar flare, slammed Earth’s magnetosphere on September 2, 1859, unleashing global auroras and sparking unexplained surges in telegraph systems. While 19th-century technology endured the chaos, the scientists warn that a similar event today could cripple navigation systems, disrupt power grids, paralyse broadband networks and cellular communications, and trigger economic losses exceeding $1 trillion.\nLed by R. Jayakrishnan, the Observatory’s Director, the university’s research team analysed magnetic records made in the days before and after the 1859 solar outburst. Their findings, now published in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) publication,Advances in Space Research, reveal that Thiruvananthapuram’s logs, neglected for over a century, captured not only the main storm but also a precursor solar flare on August 28, 1859.\n“Although documented historically, it (the earlier flare) was long overlooked due to its modest appearance. The new analysis reveals that the incident likely destabilised Earth’s magnetic environment, effectively heightening the damage inflicted by the subsequent flare just days later,” Prof. Jayakrishnan explains.\nWhat distinguishes Thiruvananthapuram’s records is the precision of its measurements. Magnetic data had been captured at intervals of 2, 3, and 5 minutes, contrasting Mumbai’s Colaba Observatory which recorded data at 5-minute intervals only. These fine-grained analog observations are being digitised as part of an archival initiative supported by the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi.\nProf. Jayakrishnan adds that the study reaffirms Kerala’s historical role in advancing solar storm research. By applying modern modelling tools to legacy datasets, the researchers reconstructed how solar energy shaped Earth’s magnetic fields over a century and a half ago.\n“We are not just studying the past, but also preparing for tomorrow,” the principal investigator said. “Mega-storms may be rare, but when they hit, they can upend modern life. Insights from Thiruvananthapuram are helping us anticipate such threats.”"

He boasted about tabling the Kantharaj commission report in the State Cabinet. But after a phone call from Delhi and Rahul Gandhi’s directions, the report, which cost ₹165 crore to prepare, was thrown into the dustbin.”\nPointing out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi too hailed from a backward community, he said, “Unlike Mr. Siddaramaiah, who keeps claiming to be a backward class leader, Mr. Modi never played identity politics but instead promoted the ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas’ motto”.\nHe alleged that the OBC outreach and emotional appeals by Mr. Siddaramaiah and the AICC were merely due to the approaching Bihar Assembly elections."

Patil in New Delhi on Wednesday.\nDuring a media briefing after the meeting in the presence of Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Irrigation Minister N.

This will bring transparency and accountability in measuring water usage at each off-take point. We have decided to complete the work on a war-footing basis,” Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said, adding that Krishna River usage had long been a bone of contention between the two States.\nOn the issue of the Srisailam Dam’s structural integrity, the Andhra Pradesh government agreed to take up urgent repairs and rehabilitation work. “The dam, which has shown signs of wear — particularly in the plunge pool area — will now be restored under the supervision of the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA). The Union government has directed Andhra Pradesh to undertake the work on priority since the Srisailam Dam falls within their jurisdiction. Whatever needs to be done, whether in the plunge pool or other parts of the dam requiring urgent attention, will be taken up immediately,” he said.\nRegarding the location of the river management board offices, it was decided that the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) will be headquartered in Hyderabad, while the KRMB will function from Andhra Pradesh. “This decision is in line with the earlier understanding reached at the Apex Council meeting in 2020, and the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act were ratified at the meeting,” the Minister said.\nThe meeting was attended by senior officials from both States, Congress MPs, including Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mallu Ravi, and representatives of the Union Jal Shakti Ministry."

    "content": "The case pertaining to the alleged murder of a minor girl at the Gandikota tourist spot of Jammalamadugu constituency in Kadapa district, took an unexpected turn, with the investigation officials ruling out the sexual assault angle, as it had been projected earlier.\nIt may be recalled that the body of the 17-year-old girl, a second-year Intermediate student at a private college in Proddatur town, was found in the bushes behind a temple on Tuesday with her upper cloth removed, suggesting  occurence of sexual attack.\nHowever, the CCTV footage revealed that her lover Lokesh had left the spot upon getting a phone call from his relatives, evidently alerting him of a possible attack by the girl’s enraged family members. The boy was seen leaving Gandikota alone, leaving the girl behind.\nThe post-mortem reportedly revealed no traces of sexual assault on the girl, nor any attempt indicative of rape. However, the body had bite marks. Meanwhile, Lokesh also reportedly confessed to have merely spent an hour at the spot with the girl.\nThe girl’s cousin brother, who was one of the suspects in the case, reached the spot on a two-wheeler long after the boyfriend left, but he too had left the spot in 20 minutes after moving loitering around. This ‘short duration visit’ has apparently left the police department in a quandary over the possibility of him executing the attack.\nThough there are no external injuries, the medical team that performed the autopsy reportedly found internal bruises to the liver and intestine, indicative of an attack with a blunt weapon or a heavy kick to the stomach. The initial talk of gangrape, as well as the death due to strangulation, head injury, smothering have been ruled out.\nKurnool Range Deputy Inspector General of Police Koya Praveen who visited the spot, along with the Kadapa Superintendent of Police E.G. Ashok Kumar on Wednesday, ruled out Lokesh’s involvement in the girl’s death.\nMr. Ashok Kumar announced that they received fresh leads in the case, however, did not divulge any details. He also hinted at the likely involvement of a miscreant who might have seen the girl in a lonely and helpless condition. “We are inching towards the culprit, but cannot divulge anything more than this as of now,” he toldThe Hindu."

Of this, ₹26,000 crore had been mobilised so far.\nMr. Naidu urged the Centre to release the next tranche of funds as a grant rather than a loan. He also expressed gratitude to the Union Government for its continued support to major infrastructure projects such as Amaravati and Polavaram irrigation project."

    "content": "With the Bhoothathankettu small hydro project plagued by inordinate delays, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) now plans to send a technical team to China to inspect a delayed batch of equipment meant for the 24 megawatt (MW) initiative.\nWhether or not to reconsider a decision taken earlier this year to terminate a contract signed with a consortium of firms from Tamil Nadu and China for the electromechanical works of the small hydro project will depend on the team’s report, according to the KSEB.\nAccording to a July 14 order, the team will consist of the Director-in-charge (Generation and Civil), Executive Engineers handling the Projects Electrical Designs (PED) wing and the Generation Division at Edamalayar, and an independent expert. They will inspect the equipment and witness tests so that a report can be placed before the KSEB director board.\nKSEB chairman and managing director Mir Mohammed Ali toldThe Hinduthat while a decision has been taken to send the team to China, the date for its departure has not yet been finalised.\nThe drawn-out dispute pertains to the delayed despatch of the third and final consignment of electromechanical equipment from China. While the KSEB has received the first two consignments, the third was delayed over disputes related to the conditions of the contract.\nThe delayed consignment consists of key components of the generators, including rotor and stator.\nThe KSEB had executed the ₹81.80-crore contract for the electromechanical works with the consortium of Sree Saravana Engineering Bhavani Ltd. (SSEB), Tamil Nadu, and Hunan Zhaoyang Generation Equipment Company Ltd., China, on March 18, 2015. Under the original agreement, the work should have been completed in August 2016. Following delays, the final extension of time was given till March 31, 2023.\nIn April this year, the KSEB issued a termination notice to the consortium. On the basis of advice from the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC), the KSEB had also decided to invite new bids for the supply of the remaining equipment from China or from other sources.\nIn May, the Tamil Nadu firm approached the Kerala High Court against the decision to scrap the contract. The KSEB also decided to hold a “final meeting” with the consortium as it had already invested ₹169 crore in the civil and electromechanical works of this project.\nAccording to the KSEB, 86.61% of the electromechanical works and 98.4% of the civil construction works on the small hydro project are over."

    "content": "The High Court of Karnataka has expressed shock over the action of the Forest Department in registering a criminal case against an Assistant Commissioner (AC) of the Revenue Department for passing a quasi-judicial order describing certain land as ‘Government Gomal’ against the claim made by the Forest Department that it was ‘forestland’.\n“What shocks the conscience of the court is the Forest Department registering a crime for the performance of the AC’s quasi-judicial functions. As an Assistant Commissioner, looking into the records, he has passed an order, not bartering away the forestland to private entity, but observing it as a ‘Sarkari Gomala’ under the Revenue Department,” the court observed.\nJustice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing a petition filed by B.A. Jagadeesh, the then AC of Hassan sub-division, who is now working as Project Director, Hassan District Urban Development Cell.\nThe complaint before the Hassan judicial magistrate was lodged by IFoS officer Saurabh Kumar, the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, Hassan territorial division, in 2024.\nThe AC passed the order on January 5, 2022, declaring certain land, situated in Tyavalli village, Shanthigrama hobli, Hassan taluk, as ‘Sarkari (government) gomal’ land and was being used by many persons to access their private land. Stating that the land was ‘government gomal’ in the Records of Tenancy and Rights (RTC) for many years, but was classified as ‘forest’ in the recent RTCs, but the Forest Department had not produced documents based on which the RTC entries were changed.\nHowever, the Hassan Deputy Commissioner, on an appeal filed by the Forest Department, passed a quasi-judicial order asking the AC to consider the issue afresh giving sufficient opportunity of hearing to the Forest Department.\nInterestingly, the Forest Department, soon after the Deputy Commissioner remanded the issue back to the AC, registered the criminal complaint on January 27, 2024, against the petitioner, who was by then not holding the post of AC, Hassan sub-division.\n“After having filed an appeal and securing an order of remand to consider the issue afresh, it did not lie with the Forest Department to register a crime against the petitioner for having performed his quasi-judicial functions, unless it is found the exercise of such function is laced with criminality and foundationed onmens rea,” the court observed while noticing that the petitioner had not given the land to any private persons but had termed as land belonging to the Revenue Department on noticing that they were used for cattle grazing for ages.\nAllowing continuation of criminal proceedings against the petitioner in such circumstances would result in the miscarriage of justice and become an abuse of the process of the law, the court said while quashing the complaint. The criminal case against the petitioner was registered for alleged violation of the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980."

My concern is that if they go to Russia now, it will get tougher to keep in touch with them. So, I wish they could stay in India,\" said Mr. Goldstein toPTIVideos on Wednesday (July 16, 2025).\nDror Goldstein (38), who said he lives for nearly six months a year in Goa, said he had been living separately from Kutina (40) for the last couple of years and that he \"lost touch\" with them when she took the daughters and left Goa a few months ago.\n\"I managed to find them on a beach in Gokarna, but Kutina refused to let me be with my children as I don’t live with them anymore,\" added Mr. Goldstein.\nHe said he met Kutina in Goa around 2017 and they had been together, travelling between India and Ukraine, until they split.\nHe said he had left India this time around in March, and because of the war, he couldn’t come before this.\n\"When I heard the news, I booked a flight immediately to Bengaluru to try and meet them,\" said Mr. Goldstein.\nHe said Kutina wants to raise the children alone.\n\"She told me in the beginning itself that if I don’t live in the same house, I should not be in touch with them at all,\" claimed Mr. Goldstein.\nWhen they left Goa a few months ago, Mr. Goldstein said he filed a missing report with the police.\n\"But now, I want to push for shared custody,\" he added.\nMr. Goldstein said he has been supporting Kutina since she gave birth to his first daughter.\n\"I give her money every month and then come here to India to spend six months with them, as I have other obligations for the other six months. Also, the visa is only for six months,\" he added.\nMr. Goldstein said his younger daughter was born in India and that Kutina has been living here (in India) for nearly five years.\n\"As I understand, she [Ama] is a citizen of India and should not be deported,\" he said.\nThe girls, Prema (6) and Ama (4), were found with Kutina in a secluded cave in the Ramatirtha hills of Kumta taluk on July 11.\nThey were found living inside a cave in Gokarna during a routine inspection by the police after a landslide in the area.\nPolice had said that all three had lived in isolation for nearly three weeks before they were found.\nIn an earlier interview withPTI, Kutina said that her life in the cave was not as it was being portrayed in the media.\nShe also complained about the place where she and her daughters were taken after being moved from the cave.\n\"We are now kept in an uncomfortable place. It’s dirty, there’s no privacy, and we get only plain rice to eat. Many of our belongings were taken, including the ashes of my son, who passed away nine months ago,\" she toldPTIVideos."

Speaking toThe Hinduin New Delhi on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Andri Boiko, Dubai-based immigration specialist and entrepreneur said pandemic, conflicts in West Asia and Ukraine, U.S. President Trump’s orders on U.S. citizenship rules and attraction of tax relief among high net worth individuals in the Global South are reshaping the immigration landscape of the world.\n“United Arab Emirates has started the golden visa scheme that will give ten year visa for high net worth individuals and for individuals with extraordinary skills from India and other countries. Argentina is also expected to start the golden visa scheme later this year,” said Mr. Boiko, explaining that the way global immigration rules are being redefined against the background of the tough changes that are being introduced by the U.S. administration.\nPresident Trump on January 20 issued Executive Order 14160“denying citizenship to persons born from a mother who was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) at the time of said person’s birth”. The order has been at the centre of a fierce debate and has been challenged in the court putting a question mark on the citizenship status of many U.S. citizens.\nMr. Boiko, who started ‘Garant In’ in 2009 as a citizenship and residency advisory service in Dubai, said changing rules and taxation are pushing more and more high achievers to find safe locations where they can ensure safety of their finances and conduct business without hindrance.\n“The UAE’s golden visa will give high net worth investors and high achievers from India and other countries the edge of Dubai while they will continue to be based in India,” said Mr. Boiko, adding, “You can get the golden visa without surrendering Indian passport and this will increasingly become a trend worldwide”.\nMr. Boiko pointed out that while some countries in the West are cracking down on illegal immigration from the Global South, there also some western countries especially Portugal, Italy, France in Europe who want to welcome high net worth individuals from major countries in the Global South. “Taxation, future security of finances and investment into the next generation, status symbol, are also among the reasons that are prompting high net worth people from the Global South to explore possibility of becoming a long term resident of a country like Italy and France,” said Mr. Boiko."

    "content": "The Union Cabinet on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) approved the “Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana”, or PMDDKY, to enhance agricultural productivity and increase adoption of sustainable agricultural practices across the country.\nThe scheme wasannounced in the Budget earlier this year. Talking to reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Centre has merged 36 schemes of 11 Ministries into the PMDDKY, which will have an outlay of ₹24,000 crore per year for six years beginning 2025-26. “This scheme will help 1.7 crore farmers,” he said.\nAlso read |Union Budget 2025: Schemes announced for farmers, middle class and students\nA release said the scheme also aims to augment post-harvest storage at the panchayat and block levels, improve irrigation facilities, and facilitate the availability of long-term and short-term credit. “The scheme will be implemented through the convergence of 36 existing schemes across 11 Departments, other State schemes, and local partnerships with the private sector... 100 districts will be identified based on three key indicators of low productivity, low cropping intensity, and less credit disbursement. The number of districts in each State/Union Territory will be based on the share of Net Cropped Area and operational holdings. However, a minimum of one district will be selected from each State,” the release added.\nThe PMDDKY is modelled on the “Aspirational District Programme” of the Centre. Mr. Vaishnaw said the “first-of-its-kind” scheme will focus exclusively on agriculture and allied sectors.\nCommittees for effective planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme will be formed at district, State and national levels. “A District Agriculture and Allied Activities Plan will be finalised by the District Dhan Dhaanya Samiti, which will also have progressive farmers as members. The district’s plans will be aligned to the national goals of crop diversification, conservation of water and soil health, and self-sufficiency in agriculture and allied sectors, as well as expansion of natural and organic farming,” the release said, adding that the scheme’s progress will be monitored on a monthly basis.\nAlso read |Agricultural agenda must move from food security to farmer prosperity: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar\nThe Government hoped that the scheme would result in higher productivity, value addition in agriculture and allied sectors, and local livelihood creation, and help increase domestic production and achieve self-reliance.\nAbhishek Jain, Fellow and Director, Green Economy and Impact Innovations, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said the scheme is a significant step toward boosting agricultural performance in India’s under-performing districts by emphasising not only productivity but also resilience through crop diversification, allied activities, value addition, soil health, and water‐use efficiency.\n“However, district selection could be improved by using annual net agricultural income per hectare,” he said, adding that the scheme should not focus on low-credit disbursement as an indicator for district selection. “A resilient agriculture system should not be dependent on credit. Instead, as we expand and diversify income streams for farmers via allied and value-added activities, and as we mainstream more sustainable agriculture practices, the reliance on external credit to fund cultivation cycles should come down, while still enhancing incomes for the farmers,” he said."

The restriction on the use of tractors on the corridor was imposed following reports that tractors were being driven in a rash and negligent manner along the crowded trekking path towards the temple, a Division Bench of Justices Anil K. Narendran and S. Muralee Krishna said while hearing a suo motu proceeding.\nThe senior government pleader submitted that the State Police  Chief had sought an explanation from Mr. Ajith Kumar on the incident. The court granted the government time to file an affidavit and posted the case for August 4.\nMeanwhile, the Pampa police registered a case against the driver on Wednesday for operating the vehicle recklessly and endangering public safety by transporting multiple individuals in a goods tractor. The FIR, however, did not mention the name of Mr. Ajith Kumar, sparking criticism and raising questions about accountability."

    "content": "Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti and J&K Peoples Conference (JKPC) chief Sajad Lone on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) opposed the move todrop Urdu as a mandatory subjectfor Naib-Tehsildar posts in Jammu and Kashmir.\n“It is deeply unfortunate that our judiciary appears to be influenced by divisive politics. Urdu, a recognised official language for decades, is now being unfairly communalised,” former J&K Chief Minister Ms. Mufti said in a post on social media platform X.\nJ&K’s revenue records and administrative work continued to be maintained in Urdu, she said. “It is only logical that applicants for the post of Naib Tehsildar possess basic proficiency in the language. This requirement is rooted purely in administrative efficiency not in any form of divisiveness,” Ms. Mufti said.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been protesting against the government notification issued in June to fill these posts. A Central Administrative Tribunal Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday passed an order to stay the operation of the provisions of the J&K Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, making knowledge of Urdu as the minimum qualification. It directed the J&K Services Selection Board to accept applications from all candidates who possess an undergraduate degree with knowledge of any of the five official languages in J&K.\n“The exclusion of Urdu as a qualifying requirement is part of a systematic marginalisation of the Kashmiri-speaking majority, and a dangerous step towards the ‘linguicide’ of Urdu,” Mr. Lone said.\nWith Urdu no longer needed to qualify for the post of Naib Tehsildar, “The majority Kashmiri-speaking population has been almost relegated to a footnote in the recruitment lists. Their presence in the recruitment lists is inversely proportional to their numbers. That is of course due to reservations,” Mr. Lone said.\nHe said that Urdu had historically given Kashmiri aspirants a reasonable edge in such posts because of the language’s relevance in administrative affairs. “It is a calculated move to erase regional linguistic roots. The onus of giving a good legal representation is on the incumbent elected government. Hope it is not yet another fixed match in a series of fixed matches that we are seeing lately,” Mr. Lone said."

Officials of the Kochi Corporation health wing the Minor Irrigation department said they did not receive any complaint about waterlogging from anywhere in the city except for the runoff water effect in some pockets.\n“Runoff water posed minor problems on some roads in Edakochi like Ambedkar Road and the Padashekharam Road,” said Abhilash Thoppil, councillor for the Edakochi South division.\nThe monsoon gathering further momentum spawned a nightmare for 77 families of the P&T Apartment Complex at Mundamveli, as their apartments continue to leak — a problem they have been facing since February 2024 whenever the rain intensifies. IIT Madras, appointed as the consultant to recommend solutions for the structural flaws in the building, is yet to issue the building stability certificate — a precondition for carrying out the truss work sanctioned by the district administration and to be executed by the Corporation — as well as the truss work design.\n“At least the truss work should be undertaken without any further delay.

    "content": "In an unusual move, the Tamil Nadu government is yet to send the list of Director-General of Police rank officers to the Union Public Service Commission for finalising the panel to appoint the next DGP/Head of Police Force.\nGoing by Supreme Court guidelines in the appointment of DGPs, the State Government should have sent the list of eligible officers to the UPSC three months before the incumbent DGP Shankar Jiwal’s retirement (August 30, 2025). Once the list of eligible officers is sent, the UPSC would prepare a panel of three officers fit for appointment as Head of Police Force and send it back to the State for picking one to the top post.\nTamil Nadu is among a few States that follow the apex court guidelines in the Prakash Singh case as regards appointment of DGPs/HoPF. It has been the practice since many years to send the list of IPS officers for UPSC empanelling and subsequent appointment. However, with just more than a month left for the present DGP to retire, there is no sign of the State initiating the process, police sources said.\nWhile there is an information that the State might amend the Tamil Nadu Police Act to enable appointment of an officer of its choice as DGP/HoPF, rumours are also agog that Mr. Shankar Jiwal may get an extension of three months with the approval of the Union Government.\nThe Supreme Court in its earlier order had directed the States to ensure that DGPs were appointed through a merit-based transparent process with a minimum tenure of two years irrespective of the date of superannuation.\nHowever, after some States appointed DGPs at the last minute giving them the benefit of a full two-year tenure, the court directed that appointing a person as DGP just before his or her retirement should be avoided. The court also ruled against the concept of appointing an officer as “acting DGP”. Despite specific guidelines, some States appointed “in-charge” DGPs or DGPs with “full additional charge” to bypass the requirement of seeking a panel from the UPSC.\nIn case the State Government sends a list of officers to the UPSC, the officers in the order of seniority who would qualify to be in the proposal are Seema Agrawal, Rajeev Kumar, Sandeep Rai Rathore, K. Vannia Perumal, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, G. Venkatraman, Vinit Dev Wankhede and Sanjay Mathur who are all in the level-16 pay matrix. Though in service, DGPs Pramod Kumar and Abhay Kumar Singh would not fit in the criteria of having a minimum of six months service left before retirement\nThough the police headquarters has written to the State Home Secretary that vacancy to the top post in the police force would arise on August 30, 2025, no decision has been taken yet on sending a proposal to the UPSC for finalising the panel. The UPSC’s selection committee is headed by its Chairman and includes the Union Home Secretary, the concerned State’s Chief Secretary and DGP, and one of the heads of the Central Armed Police Forces nominated by the MHA not belonging same State cadre as members, the sources said.\nWhether Tamil Nadu will deviate from the convention of complying with the Supreme Court guidelines in the appointment of DGPs and go ahead posting an officer of its choice to head the force remains to be seen."

The third edition of the job fair recorded a two-fold increase in attendance compared to the previous fair, which had attracted around 10,000 participants.\nMLA Mohammed Majid Hussain said that in the run-up to the job fair, training sessions were organised for aspirants covering various skills, including drafting resumes, and understanding how to avoid plagiarism in such documents.\n“There was a five-day training session, followed by a one-day training. If you see, youth often indulge in copy-pasting CVs. We wanted to ensure that they do not do this, and they are drafted in accordance with their skills and qualifications. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all CV,” Mr Hussain said, adding that the job fairs were part of AIMIM’s pre-election promise.\nWhile over 2,000 candidates received job offers on the spot, several hundred others are scheduled to appear for subsequent rounds of interviews at the companies’ offices. Mr Hussain expressed optimism that the number of final job offers would rise significantly in the coming weeks.\n“We will be doing this exercise every four or five months, and on the advice of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi. It is a labour and logistics-intensive initiative. From what we have understood, more such platforms are required. There is talent, and companies want such people,” he said.\nMukarram Ali Siddiqui, a member of Mr. Hussain’s team, pointed out the significant presence of women at the fair and noted that jobs suitable for differently-abled individuals were also available. “Job offers ranged from gig work to IT and IT-enabled services,” he said.\nThe AIMIM has indicated plans to continue holding such fairs at regular intervals to address the employment aspirations of the youth."

The inclusion in ground rest of light motor vehicles of angular parking, parallel parking, zig-zag driving, and gradient tests and the limiting of the number of driving tests conducted per day by one motor vehicle inspector (MVI) and one assistant MVI to 40. It also upheld the qualifications specified for driving school instructors.\nThe order was issued following a batch of petitions filed by the All Kerala Motor Driving School, Instructors and Workers Association and others challenging the circular and the subsequent government orders that introduced changes in the conduct of driving licence tests. The petitioners said that as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the power to make rules relating to the licensing and regulation of schools or establishments that imparted instruction in driving motor vehicles vested with the Union government and that the State cannot encroach upon the legislative domain exclusively assigned to the Centre. Upholding the contention, the court said that neither the State government nor the Transport Commissioner cant usurp the powers vested with the Centre in this regard."

After the project started operating in September 2011, the company paid 12% royalty for 12 years, but refused to pay an additional 6% royalty from September 2023.\nThe dispute reached the Himachal Pradesh High Court and the decision was given in favour of the company. The State government then challenged the order in the Supreme Court and got a favourable ruling.\nThe government is hopeful that this decision would also pave the way for other projects that have completed twelve years, which could generate an income of over ₹250 crore per year to the State treasury, the statement said."

It has also not permitted the enhancement of 800 MBBS seats in government medical colleges citing lack of necessary infrastructure and faculty recruitment.\n“We were hoping to get permission to start three new medical colleges and enhance medical seats in government medical colleges this year, but the NMC has rejected permission for both,” said B. L. Sujatha Rathod, Director, Directorate of Medical Education.\nThe Medical Education Department had submitted a proposal to establish three new medical colleges, including two government colleges and one private one — Ramanagara Institute of Medical Sciences in Ramanagara, Kanakapura Institute of Medical Sciences in Kanakapura, and Farooq Academy of Medical Sciences in Mysuru — this year.\nThe State government has been submitting proposals to start government medical colleges in Ramanagara and Kanakapura for the last three years. However, the NMC had denied permission to start the colleges in 2023-24 and 2024-2025 citing the same reasons.\nMedical colleges in Ramanagara and Kanakapura are championed by Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar who has held multiple meetings with Medical Education Minister Sharan Prakash Patil. Mr. Shivakuma has instructed to make the necessary preparations for the start of the new medical colleges. But, this year too, a request was submitted to start the colleges without appointing the required teaching staff."

    "content": "Canadian investors and businesses are looking at India with renewed optimism against the backdrop of attempts by both countries to recondition their bilateral ties, said Victor T. Thomas, president and CEO of the Canada-India Business Council.\n“The new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has certainly signalled the opportunity to engage with India, including inviting Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi to the G-7 Summit. In many ways, this was a reset in Canada-India relations, as trade diversification has been a major focus in Canada in 2025.”\nThis gesture was more than symbolic — it demonstrated a strategic recognition of India’s growing global economic importance. PM Carney’s tone and early actions have re-established some trust on the India file and reignited some bilateral momentum. The business community sees this as an opportunity to rebuild and grow the commercial relationship and hopefully finally sign an Early Progress Trade Agreement after our closest allies, like Australia, and most recently, the U.K., have paved the way,” Mr. Thomas said.\nMr. Thomas said that the business community is encouraged by recent signals arising from the meeting of the Prime Ministers and the move to restore the respective High Commissioners in Ottawa and New Delhi. India and Canada withdrew their respective High Commissioners in 2024, following allegations that Indian agents had orchestrated the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada.\n“The business community values stability and predictability and has continued to make deals and stay active despite recent diplomatic challenges. These are encouraging signals for long-term business planning and I’m cautiously optimistic that relations will continue to improve,” said Mr. Thomas.\nAccording to Mr. Thomas, India presents enormous potential for Canadian firms looking to diversify beyond the U.S. market. Canada and the U.S. are locked in a trade war. “Canadian companies already active in India are seeing real success, on the investment side of things, particularly in infrastructure and real estate. This year, investments from Canada into India — both direct and indirect — hovers around CA $100 billion! There are still many untapped opportunities to explore and with complementary strengths in sectors like agri-food, energy, education, and resources, there’s far more we can achieve together,” he said."

This follows instances reported during the seat allotment process last year, where students tried to misuse the quota by submitting sponsorship from people who are not directly related to them.\nTo prevent such misuse and help genuine candidates who have blood relative sponsors, the KEA has issued a circular informing students and parents that for NRI ward sponsors, it is compulsory to transfer the sponsor amount from the sponsor’s account directly to KEA.\n“In case the candidate finds it difficult to transfer the amount immediately, then they can submit a Demand Draft (DD) for the same amount to KEA and get their admission order. The DD will be returned as soon as the sponsor transfers the amount,” it said.\nThis year, KEA has also made it mandatory for NRI ward quota claimers to get the family tree certified from respective tehsildars. Last year, KEA had received over 500 applications claiming seats under NRI ward, of which 320 were found eligible and during the second level of verification 14 candidates were found submitting fake documents to claim the quota."

Even the security failed to maintain the dignity of the court.\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi with Uttar Pradesh party President Ajay Rai at the special MP/MLA court for a hearing in a defamation case filed over the former’s purported remarks on Army personnel.

In Lucknow, Mr. Gandhi’s security was compromised for more than three hours.”\nMultiple videos of huge crowd inside the courtroom with Mr. Gandhi and within court premises went viral, with people even taking selfies.\nThe Congress said the authorities should look into the matter. “I was not present there, but the security of Rahulji, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, is the responsibility of the Home Ministry and the State government. Any breakdown in security is not acceptable,” said Imran Masood, Congress MP.\nOn July 15, Mr. Gandhi appeared before the MP/MLA Special Court in Lucknow in connection with a case of allegedly making a defamatory statement against the Indian Armed Forces during his Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022. The Congress leader, who surrendered in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Alok Verma, was granted bail after the court allowed his application."

    "content": "The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is set to float a tender for the third time to microchip stray dogs, even as a charitable trust has moved the High Court to challenge the project. The matter is currently sub judice.\nAccording to the tender proposal, the project is estimated to cost ₹3.23 crore. Of this, ₹3.09 crore is allocated for procuring 1,62,817 microchips and ₹14.85 lakh is set aside for purchasing 50 microchip readers. A BBMP official overseeing the project explained that each microchip, measuring around 1–1.5 mm, will be injected into the first layer of a dog’s skin near the neck using a hypodermic needle. This procedure will be carried out by specialists working under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. As the official noted, the selected contractor will be required to procure the microchips, which are not manufactured in India, and also provide software for storing and managing the associated data.\n“Procurement will take place in phases as we complete implanting the previously procured microchips. We will inform the contractor in advance, and they will be responsible for supplying the next batch,” the official toldThe Hindu, adding that while there is no fixed deadline, the project is expected to be completed within one or two years. The contractor is also required to provide software services, which the BBMP will access for free for a period of one year. After that, the contractor will submit an annual cost estimate, and the BBMP will subscribe accordingly.\nAccording to BBMP officials, only two known contractors, one from Gujarat and one from Mumbai, currently meet the eligibility criteria. Suralkar Vikas Kishor, Special Commissioner (Health and Animal Husbandry), BBMP, stated that the first tender, floated in February last year, received no bids. A second tender was issued later that year and awarded to a contractor, but he failed to meet the software service requirements specified in the tender.\nMeanwhile, the BBMP conducted a pilot project in which microchips were implanted in 500 stray dogs. An audit conducted 15 days later showed no adverse effects on the dogs, and the chips functioned effectively, according to Mr. Kishor. Each microchip will contain a GPS tracker and a Unique Identification Number (UIN), enabling BBMP officials to locate microchipped dogs. The UIN will store data, including vaccination details, the dog’s location, and photographs, all of which will be stored on a server accessible via the software.\nAnimal rights activist Arun Prasad called the project illegal. “ABC rules do not permit the implantation of microchips in free-roaming stray dogs. They only allow private dog owners to microchip their pets for identification purposes,” said Mr. Prasad. A Bengaluru-based charitable trust has filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court challenging the project. The case is currently under judicial consideration."

He released the video showing the dead venomous stinger in halwa with the voice accusing the shop for allegedly not showing due attention in preparing and packing the sweet.\n“Since the shop has sold halwa with venomous scorpion, I’m planning to approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum,” the voice says.\nAfter this disturbing visual was shared on social media, officials attached to the Department of Food Safety inspected the shop and the kitchen where halwa is prepared.\n“We’ve served notice to the halwa shop and shared the visuals with the owner of the shop seeking his clarification on this issue. Based on our findings, we’ve asked the shop owner to take a few measures to ensure better housekeeping like fixing mesh in the windows and other holes in the kitchen through which the insects can enter. We’ve also lifted samples from the kitchen and sent for analysis. Based on the analysis report and our findings in the shop, due action will follow,” Designated Food Safety Officer, Tirunelveli, Pushparaj, said.\nThe halwa shop workers categorically denied that there was no chance for a scorpion getting packed along with halwa.\n“We maintain superior cleanliness in the kitchen at any given time. Since halwa would be very hot when it is packed, it would even burn your skin if a small portion accidentally falls on you. So, no insect will come even closer to the hot pan. As we suspect foul play in this issue, we’re planning to file a complaint with the police since this incident should not tarnish our credibility,” said sources in the shop."

The PM is scheduled to address a public meeting at Gandhi Maidan in Motihari. “This would be PM Modi’s 53rdvisit to Bihar and sixth to Motihari in the last 11 years. For earlier Prime Ministers, Bihar was never a priority,” Mr. Jaiswal added.

The PM will also flag off three trains.\nFormer BJP MP from East Champaran Radha Mohan Singh said that “people from as many as 24 assembly constituencies of the region are likely to participate on Friday, to make it an unparalleled event.”\nDistrict administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the forthcoming visit of the Prime Minister at Motihari. “As many as 15 IPS officers, over four dozen Dy SPs, 100 Inspector rank officials, and over 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel will be deployed during the PM’s visit,” a senior police official at the state headquarters in Patna said. Top administrative officials have already visited the place, he added.\n“The Prime Minister’s visit to East Champaran will definitely enthuse and boost the morale of our grassroots party leaders and workers. Yes, the PM is our star campaigner for the party ahead of the assembly elections,” a state BJP leader asserted. “He will keep coming before the polls, and his visits will definitely, uplift our party leaders and workers’ morale,” he added. Several public meetings have been scheduled for the Prime Minister in Bihar over the next two months, ahead of the assembly elections.\nMeanwhile, Opposition leaders see nothing “unusual” in the Prime Minister’s regular visits to the election-bound State. “This is an election year, and every party leader is expected to address public meetings. But the Prime Minister should also speak about basic issues of unemployment, and migration, confronting the State. Of late, the law-and-order situation in the State has become alarming, and the PM must say something on this as well,” leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said. Mr. Yadav has regularly been raising public issues and making announcements on providing jobs and promoting industrialisation in the state. “But the Prime Minister will keep talking about the jungle raj issue to mislead common people,” RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said.\nOpposition leaders also wanted the PM to address the “chaos & confusion” caused by the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state, the RJD leaders said. Earlier, Mr. Yadav had accused the Election Commission of “working on behalf of the BJP.”\nJD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar countered, “He is the Prime Minister of the country, not only Bihar. He has to look after the development of the State along with the country. We welcome his visit to the state.”"

    "content": "India may have achieved an important milestone of sourcing 50% of its electric power capacity, or about 484 gigawatts, from non fossil-fuel sources, though publicly available data show that the share of clean energy in the electricity actually supplied is below 30%.\n“India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources — five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] to the Paris Agreement,” Pralhad Joshi, Minister for New and Renewable Energy, said earlier this week. “This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development, and signals that India’s clean energy transition is not only real but also accelerating under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”\nIn 2014, the share of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, biomass, hydropower (small and large) and nuclear power – constituted about 30% of India’s installed electricity capacity. As on June 30, 2025 – as per the Centre – it rose to 50%. However, the share of electricity generated from these sources rose from 17% in 2014-15 to 28% in the May 2025-26 period.\nTo be sure, the quantum of clean energy (non-fossil) produced annually has risen quite significantly from 190 billion units in 2014-15 to 460 billion units in 2024-25.\nExperts say that despite the rise in clean energy, the slower increase in utilising clean energy was due to the “capacity utilisation factor” (CUF), a measure of how much available energy was usable. CUF values for clean energy have been lower than that of coal or nuclear sources. “While solar and wind now make up a large share of installed capacity, their CUFs are much lower. Solar has CUF of approximately 20% and wind around 25-30%, compared to coal’s 60% or nuclear’s 80%. This means their contribution to actual generation remains limited despite high installed capacity,” said Arunendra kumar Tiwari, Fellow, The Energy Resources Institute.\nBase load demand, or power that is available through the day, is largely provided by coal, which makes up about 75% of India’s energy mix. While there was a rise in solar energy utilisation and easing demand on coal during the daytime, particularly in summer, was unavailable in the evening.\n“To improve utilisation of solar, we primarily need two things: flexibility in the grid and improved battery storage. Right now we pay the same (per unit) for electricity, whether night or day. Much like in the early days of telecom, when night calls were cheaper, we need to experiment with differential tarrifs for electricity during the day.\nThis however will require smart grids and better management,” said Saurabh Kumar, vice-president, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and an expert on energy, “We have several schemes that are being working on and in the next one or two years, I expect there will be significant improvement.”\nIn the days ahead, an increase in ‘hybrid’ power projects that combine solar, wind, hydro and storage elements to meet India’s growing peak and round-the-clock power needs are the way forward, says a policy note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “When paired with battery storage, these hybrids can store surplus energy and release it during peak demand hours, particularly in the evening. However, deployment is currently limited by challenges such as land-aggregation issues, lack of coordinated transmission planning, and high cost of storage components.”"

Recent successes in Chhattisgarh include the killing of general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju (70) who was neutralised by security forces in Narayanpur on May 21 and in a departure from the previous years, operations are continuing in monsoon this year.\n“Significantly, the Dandakaranya region, which spans parts of Bastar Range districts and Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra, has been identified as the area of maximum damage, with 281 Maoists neutralised in the past one year alone,” the IG said. Out of the 357 deceased, 136 were women cadres.\n“As per the vision of the Government of India and the Government of Chhattisgarh, the security forces are adopting a pro-people and development-centric approach.

Sharma Oli to New Delhi is being planned shortly after his return.\nMr. Modi was expected to travel to the U.K. to sign the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but officials said the trip, which is still being planned for July 24, has not been “finalised” and could be delayed.\nMr. Modi is expected to land in Male on July 25, and will be given a ceremonial welcome. He will hold bilateral talks with Maldives’ President Mohamed Muizzu, who visited India in June 2024 for Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony and then for a State visit in October. Among a number of development initiatives, both sides are expected to build on the launch of digital payment system UPI and mechanisms to increase tourist arrivals between both countries, officials working on the visit said.\nOn July 26, Mr. Modi has been invited as a guest to the Independence Day parade and other special ceremonies to mark 60 years of the Maldives getting independence from the British in 1965. The invitation was announced by Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India in May this year.\nOfficials said that India and the U.K. have also been discussing a short visit to London by Mr. Modi before he travels to Male, on July 24, to sign the FTA that was announced by him and Mr. Starmer on May 6. However, it is understood that some technical and “legal scrubbing” is still required to be finished, and the trip may require to be put off or held after the Male visit.\nThe visit to the Maldives is significant as it marks Mr. Modi’s first visit to the neighbouring country since the election of Mr. Muizzu in November 2023. Ties between India and Maldives hit a rough patch over the “India Out” campaign that Mr. Muizzu had backed during his campaign, and the “Boycott Maldives” social media campaign that followed over criticism of Mr. Modi by Maldivian Ministers.\nHowever, the two sides subsequently resolved issues, after India agreed to replace military personnel stationed there for aircraft management with civilian engineers. India has also increased its Lines of Credit and outlay to Maldives from ₹470 crore in 2024-25 to ₹600 crore in the latest budget, and extended a much needed currency swap facility to help Maldives with its debt repayment crisis last year.\nDiplomatic sources further said that India is expected to host Nepal’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli later this month and that discussions are on.\nMr. Oli was one of the first regional leaders to condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam and, subsequently, India accommodated Nepalese citizens while airlifting stranded nationals from Iran against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict.\nMr. Oli in recent months, has also praised India for supporting the democratic process in post-monarchy Nepal. While plans are underway for the visit, there are also internal political developments in Nepal that will be taken into consideration at the planning stage. On Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N), withdrew support to Mr. Oli’s government, reducing the ruling coalition to a minority in the Upper House of the Nepalese Parliament — National Assembly.\nMr. Oli’s India proposed visit has acquired heightened attention as he was sworn in on July 15, 2024 but has not visited India till now, but had visited China in December last year."

    "content": "DMK Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva’s controversial comments that former Chief Minister and Congress stalwart K. Kamaraj wouldn’t sleep without an air conditioner and that he held the hands of  DMK patriarch  M. Karunanidhi in his (Kamaraj’s) final days and urged him to ‘protect democracy’ have caused some unease within the DMK-Congress alliance. TNCC president K. Selvaperunthagai and party Karur MP S. Jothimani have criticised Mr. Siva for his remarks.\nMr. Selvaperunthagai said nobody had the right to question or speak in such a manner about  Kamaraj. “He (Siva) is speaking without any evidence. Leave him. Nobody is qualified to criticise Kamarajar,” he said.\nMs. Jothimani said Kamaraj was not only known for his honesty and administrative skills, but also for his simplicity, and added that he was defeated in elections because of  myths spread by the DMK.\n“He travelled to every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu. . These nooks and corners  do not have air conditioned rooms or five-star hotels. As a Chief Minister, Kamaraj stayed in the government hostels and even slept under a tree when the heat was too much,”  she said. Mr Siva’s statements were “completely untrue.”\n“Kamaraj’s soul will not forgive us if we do not give a proper response to the myths spread against him. Every Congress worker should remember that the party is still standing in the political field in Tamil Nadu because of him.”\nReacting to Mr Siva’s comments, TMC (Moopanar) leader G.K. Vasan said the party was pained over this and strongly condemned them. “Kamaraj is instrumental for the growth attained by Tamil Nadu today. His tenure was known as the golden rule. He was a role model known for his simplicity and integrity. Therefore, such wrong statements (by Mr. Siva) should not have been made,” Mr. Vasan said.\nLater in the day, Mr. Siva requested that his remarks on Kamaraj not be turned into a debate, adding that he held the late leader in high regard.\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Tiruchi Velusamy’s comments at a public rally in Manaparai that only a coalition government is feasible in Tamil Nadu after the 2026 Assembly election raised some eyebrows. “We are not saints. Our intention is to attain power in Tamil Nadu. If my prediction is right, the next government can only be a coalition government and two Congressmen will be ministers. First let us become ministers in Tamil Nadu and then capture power in the State,” he said.\nReacting to it, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said, “This may be his view. But, anything related to seat sharing or sharing of power will be decided by the Congress leadership.”"

    "content": "The launch of the Ungaludan Stalin Scheme (USS) by the DMK regime has prompted the AIADMK to liken it to the Assured Maximum Service to Marginal People in All Villages (AMMA) scheme, which was implemented by the previous AIADMK government when Jayalalithaa was Chief Minister.\nAt least on two occasions in the last couple of days, the general secretary of the principal Opposition party, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is on a State-wide tour, called the new scheme an instance of the DMK government resorting to “pasting stickers” on what was carried out by his party while in power. On Tuesday, former Revenue Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, too, made the same point in a social media post. According to the policy note of the Revenue Department for 2020-21, around 64.15 lakh petitions were received at 64,079 camps during 2012-2020, of which 64.09 lakh petitions were disposed of.\nThe two schemes have a common objective - providing government services at the people’s doorstep. Apart from redressing the grievances of the people, both the schemes pave the way for enrolment of new beneficiaries under various schemes. For example, about 10 years ago, the registration of farmers under the Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana) and individuals under Aadhaar was given priority. Currently, the coverage of new beneficiaries under the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai (KMUT), a basic income scheme for women heads of families, is being given importance.\nStill, the two schemes differ in scope, according to a perusal of the government orders issued in March 2013 (on the AMMA scheme), and in June 2025 (on USS). The key difference between the two schemes is that while the former took care of only those in rural areas, the latter will cover people in urban areas, too. As per the G.O. issued by the Public (Mudhalvarin Mugavari) Department on June 19, a total of 10,000 camps would be held in the next four months (till November). In urban areas, 3,768 camps would be conducted and, in rural areas, 6,232. Among districts, Salem accounts for the highest number of camps at 432, followed by Chennai (400) and Tiruvallur (389).\nClarifying that the current government’s latest initiative is an improved version of Makkaludan Mudhalvar, which was inaugurated in urban areas in November 2023 and extended to the remaining areas gradually, P. Amudha, Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue and Disaster Management), told The Hindu that the USS had been launched with a “door-to-door campaign”.\nTo a query on the continuance of Ungalai Thedi Ungal Ooril, another outreach programme of the government launched in January 2024, wherein Collectors would stay in a given taluk on a designated day for 24 hours to take up field visits, interact with the public, and get feedback on government schemes, Ms. Amudha said it would resume “after the USS camps”.\nWouldn’t the system of providing services to the people online, without direct interface with officials, be better than the conventional way of holding camps, receiving petitions, and disposing of them? To this, the official said that “due to illiteracy and lack of clarity” among sections of petitioners, “supporting documents” were not attached while applying online. This had led to the rejection of a number of applications."

Initial inquiry revealed that, based on orders of Asra Garg, IGP (North Zone), special teams were formed as part of a crackdown on drug trafficking.\nFollowing an alert, special police teams were conducting surprise vehicle checks around public places when they saw the trio loitering at the railway station in a suspicious way. When questioned, the trio gave contradictory answers on their purpose of travel and later confessed that they were waiting to upload ganja consignment to Chennai by train. Subsequently, police checked their jute bags and found ganja.\nWalajah police registered a case and lodged them at the Central Prison in Vellore. It was found that the seized ganja was meant to sell in retail among workers in industrial sites in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Puducherry. A probe is underway."

    "content": "Fish farming in an irrigation tank, which is maintained by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), at Melathikkan village near Tiruvannamalai town has been revived for the season due to rain in recent weeks, resulting in steady rise of waterflow to the tank.\nAccompanied by Collector K. Tharpagaraj, Minister for Public Works and Highways E.V. Velu released young fish in the tank on Wednesday as part of fish cultivation by farmers in the region.\nOfficials of the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation (TNFDC), which maintains fish farms in the district, said that fish cultivation, including harvesting, is done during May to August due to the steady reduction of hot weather and gradual rise in water level due to south-west monsoon.\nThese months also help to retain adequate oxygen in the farming area of the tank due to slow evaporation. Also, as the water level is almost steady, fishing in the waters in the tank remains safe for fishermen. “Local fishermen from the neighbouring Edapalayam village have been doing the job for many years. Such roping of local skilled workers helps to prevent poaching and also provides jobs for them,” S. Velan, Assistant Director (AD), Department of Fisheries (Tiruvannamalai), toldThe Hindu.\nAt Melathikkan tank, Catla, Roya and Mithila are the preferred freshwater fish varieties that are cultivated with acumen, involving local fishermen and officials of the fisheries department. These fish varieties were chosen at least for two reasons - speedy growth and good taste, especially for spicy fish curries. They weighed over one kg in three months after they were left in the tank. As per norms, each hectare of tank area, on average, should release around 2,000 fish should be released to maintain the fish growth in the tank. In other words, 60% of the total area of the tank should be the total number of fish released.\nDivided into forenoon and afternoon, fishing in the tank will be done by 18 units of local fishermen, closely monitored by the officials. Each unit has at least two fishermen in a coracle with a target of 20kg per team everyday.\nIn other words, fishing in the tank should yield at least 0.5 tonnes (500 kgs) daily especially during the peak month of August. These fishermen are paid on a daily basis. Of the total catch, one-third goes for local consumption with the rest goes to the government-run stalls and buyers in the State."

Mr. Vaishnaw also said that the government would address duplication issues posed by States’ own digital service centres. The Minister was speaking at the annual CSC Diwas, where VLEs from around the country gather.\nCSCs are key in making online government services and websites available to people living in remote areas. Lalremruata, 29, a VLE in Lawngtlai, Mizoram had “facilitated business worth over ₹8 crore through his CSC in the financial year 2024–25,” the government said in an award citation. Mr. Lalremruata was felicitated at the event alongside other VLEs working in remote districts. There are over 5.6 lakh CSCs in India, and over four-fifths of them are in rural areas.\nWhile Mr. Vaishnaw and Minister of State for IT Jitin Prasada spoke, much of the VLEs’ enthusiastic applause went to Bhuvnesh Kumar, who is the chief executive officer of the Aadhaar issuing Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). CSCs have not been able to perform enrolments and major updates for Aadhaar since 2018, following an order of the Supreme Court.\nStill, VLEs hope to regain that business, as Aadhaar enrolment and updates are a potentially high volume business. Mr. Prasada and Mr. Vaishnaw said they would look into the issue, but did not commit themselves to reopening all Aadhaar enrolment and update activities to CSCs just yet (VLEs can only perform address and other “demographic” updates for the moment).\n“Don’t clap until the work is done,” Mr. Prasada said. Mr. Vaishnaw said he would discuss the issue with Mr. Kumar.\nMr. Prasada pointed to the issue of cybersecurity, and urged VLEs to work with the government on the issue. India has seen major digitisation, he said. “But with such big achievements, there are equally big challenges and those challenges are of cyber security in which you will also play a very important role to equip the people of India,” he said. “All these things are related to the security of the country. We should take care of the people and there should be a constant dialogue.”"

    "content": "After months of suspense, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership has finally zeroed in on former MLC Naraparaju Ramchander Rao as the new president of the State unit for the next three years. A veteran of student politics, a legal eagle, and long considered the intellectual face of the party, Mr. Rao replaces Union Minister for Coal & Mines G. Kishan Reddy, who held the post for the last two years.\nAlthough the position was slated as an election, Mr. Rao was the only candidate to file a nomination.\nMr. Rao has the backing of the BJP’s central leadership, which will help him to streamline his work systematically. Amid mounting pressure to appoint a Backward Class candidate as the party chief, the BJP stuck to its convention of recognising leaders who have risen from the grassroots. Mr. Rao edged out Malkajgiri MP Eatala Rajender, who had used all his resources to get the top post.\nThe next Assembly and Parliament elections are still four years away, but there has been intense competition among the aspirants for the coveted post. While the selection process was repeatedly delayed, lobbying for the prestigious post never disappeared. Over the past six years, the BJP has taken a calculated risk in wooing leaders from other political parties.\nThe party tasted success in the 2023 Assembly elections, where eight BJP candidates — seven of them first-timers — emerged victorious. The same tempo continued in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, where the BJP again won eight seats, doubling its tally from 2019. Interestingly, several outsiders joined the party and went on to become MPs.\nHowever, the BJP, by encouraging those from other parties, created resentment among old timers. This also led to groupism in the party, which seldom tolerates indiscipline and discourages leader-centric politics. This heartburn among the loyal leaders and cadres has been contained with the appointment of Mr. Rao.\nIn Telangana, where Backward Classes form the largest share of the electorate, followed by Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and then Forward Castes, most major parties — especially the Congress — have focused heavily on winning their support. With this backdrop, BJP workers had hoped the party would elevate a Backward Class leader as State president.\nTo the surprise of everyone, the top brass went ahead by loyalty and commitment, naming Mr. Rao, a Brahmin, as the party chief.\nComing to the caste equations, the BJP is known to hold a strong sway among the Brahmins and the influential Velama community, followed by a few Backward Class communities. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have, traditionally, avoided sailing with the saffron party.\nThe powerful Reddy community, which traditionally sailed with the Congress, had shifted its support base over the years. In the 2018 Assembly elections, it leaned toward the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), backed the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and returned to the Congress fold in 2023.\nAccording to the Socio-Economic, Education, Employment, Political and Caste Survey — which covered 3,54,77,554 people and 1,12,15,134 families — Backward Classes account for 56.33% of Telangana’s population, including 10.08% BC Muslims. SCs make up 17.43%, STs 10.45%, and Muslims 12.56% (of whom 2.48% are OC Muslims). Forward Castes constitute 13.31% of the population.\nTherefore, the new BJP chief has his task cut out to woo the Backward Class voters. Beyond his political capabilities, Mr. Rao’s leadership will be tested in the upcoming local body polls. It is a fact that the BJP has not penetrated the rural areas as expected, with its support base largely confined to a few pockets. The local body polls, particularly the gram panchayat elections, which are held on a non-party basis, will require Mr. Rao to focus on identifying willing and capable candidates. The BJP will be up against the ruling Congress, which will leave no stone unturned to secure a victory. The BRS, the main Opposition party, will also be in the reckoning.\nIf the BJP hopes to make further inroads in the State, Mr. Rao will have to channel all his energy into reaching every corner of Telangana; constituting village units, and enthusing the cadres. His experience and ideological grounding will be put to the test in the coming months, as he takes on both the ruling Congress and the BRS.\nravi.reddy@thehindu.co.in"

    "content": "What does it mean to live in a democracy if your name no longer appears on the electoral roll? In Bihar today, this question has attained chilling salience. Lakhs of citizens face an imminent threat of disenfranchisement solely because they may be unable to meet the onerous, shifting, and arbitrary burdens imposed on them by the Election Commission of India (ECI)’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR).\nThe revision, announced in June 2025, with Bihar’s State elections looming in the background, has ushered in a period of deep uncertainty. There can be little doubt that electoral rolls must be periodically updated, ensuring that people eligible to vote are included and ineligible persons are excluded. The integrity of our democratic process demands nothing less.\nHowever, the present exercise seeks to redraw the rolls in a fashion that is both opaque and hurried. With the publication of a draft roll scheduled for August 1, it is difficult to see how the administration can conduct so expansive an exercise in a constitutionally sound manner within so narrow a time frame.\nMore troubling still is the nature of the classifications that the ECI has introduced. A June 24 notification lists 11 acceptable forms of documentary proof — these range from passports and caste certificates to matriculation records. But, notably, it omits others that are more widely held, including Aadhaar card, ration card, driver’s licence, and even the Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) issued by the ECI itself.\nIn parallel, the exercise also carves out a difference between voters who were included in the roll as part of the last intensive revision in 2003 and those added subsequently. The latter group must now re-establish their eligibility through a fresh application supported by documents. The ECI has not explained why it believes these entries, created and verified through its past processes, now warrant re-verification on a mass scale. If the implication is that the prior inclusion was flawed, then the onus must lie with the state, not with the voter.\nPeople from Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar found during Bihar Special Intensive Revision, says ECI; INDIA hits back\nNot foreigners, Biharis will decide fate of Bihar: BJP\nBihar SIR: CPI(ML) slams Election Commission claim of foreigners on electoral rolls\nBihar SIR: Only 6.85% of voters yet to submit their enumeration forms\nCongress draws parallels between the NRC, and the SIR in Bihar\nSpecial Intensive Revision is a BJP 'conspiracy': Prashant Kishor\nTo be sure, Article 324 of the Constitution empowers the ECI to maintain superintendence, direction, and control over the preparation of the electoral rolls. Article 326 also mandates that elections are predicated on adult suffrage — that is to say, every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than eighteen years of age on an appointed date shall be eligible to vote.\nTo that end, The Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1950, authorises the ECI to revise the rolls from time to time, and even to carry out “special revisions” where necessary. But these powers are not unlimited. They are subject to a slew of constitutional protections. The exercise of discretion, however well-intentioned, must be rooted in legality and proportionality and must remain restrained by the rights of those it affects.\nThe Supreme Court of India has long affirmed that free and fair elections constitute a non-negotiable cornerstone of India’s constitutional order. While the right to vote flows from statute, it remains critical to this guarantee — it operates within a framework that promises equality and political participation. Consequently, the process by which electoral rolls are revised must conform to standards of procedural fairness, transparency and non-discrimination. A revision that imposes unduly onerous burdens — particularly without adequate notice — on registered voters to re-establish their citizenship and which permits exclusions based on vague and inconsistently applied criteria would certainly fall afoul of these imperatives.\nEditorial |​Widen the net: On Supreme Court and Bihar’s revision of electoral rolls\nUnder Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality, a classification made by the state must satisfy a two-part test: there must be an intelligible differentia distinguishing those people grouped together from those people left out. And that differentia must bear a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law or action in question.\nOn this test, the classifications made under the SIR are deeply suspect. First, there is the division between voters added during the intensive revision in 2003 and those added thereafter. Even assuming that this distinction is intelligible, its relevance to the stated objective — of ensuring electoral-roll integrity — remains unclear. Is the ECI suggesting that its post-2003 additions were based on weaker evidentiary standards? If so, why have those names remained on the rolls through successive elections?\nSecond, the categorisation of identity documents also appears arbitrary. The notification treats school-leaving certificates as sufficient documentation, but disregards ECI-issued EPIC Cards, introducing, in the process, an element of unreasonableness that is impossible to reconcile with the guarantee of equal treatment. The consequences of these decisions are far-reaching. If the draft electoral roll published on August 1 omits previously registered voters, they will be left with a mere 30 days to furnish further documents evincing eligibility. That burden will fall most heavily on individuals who are least equipped to shoulder it — the socially marginalised and the economically disadvantaged. Many might not even be aware that their names have been deleted. To impose new documentary hurdles is to raise the cost of participation for those already furthest from the system.\nBihar Special Intensive Revision: The struggle to be counted\nBihar Special Intensive Revision: Electoral Registration Officers empowered to decide voter inclusion in absence of documents, says Election Commission of India\nThe dark signs of restricted or selective franchise\nThe Election Commission of India does not have unfettered powers\nWhat the ‘neutral clean-up’ of Bihar’s poll rolls really is\nBihar Special Intensive Revision: Five of 11 documents sought do not show date or place of birth\nOn July 10, lengthy arguments were advanced before a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on whether the SIR should be stayed. During the hearing, the Bench appeared perplexed by the ECI’s exclusion of widely held identity documents. While it did not issue any interim restraint, the Court said that it would be in the “interest of justice” if the ECI “also considers the following three documents as well (apart from the 11 documents mentioned in order dated 24.06.2025), i.e., A) Aaadhar Card; B) Electors Photo Identify Card (EPIC), which is issued by Election Commission of India itself, and C) the Ration Card”.\nBut what does the word “consider” mean in this context? Must the ECI accept these documents as valid evidence, or merely review them and reject them if it so chooses? The ambiguity leaves enough doubt to create further delay, which can also potentially lead to the creation of a fait accompli. By the time the matter returns to the Court, the draft roll will be on the verge of publication, with voters who have been wrongly excluded scrambling to meet deadlines.\nGiven the gravity of the issues involved and given the impending Assembly elections in the State, the status quo in the case must be preserved. But, equally, given that the questions are limited and the record essentially documentary, the Court must move swiftly. It should prompt parties to exchange pleadings without delay and schedule the matter for a final hearing before the revision becomes irreversible.\nThe legitimacy of an election depends not only on the fairness of its outcome but also on the inclusiveness of its process. When the rules of inclusion are changed midstream, when the onus of proof is moved without reason, and when constitutional guarantees are filtered through layers of bureaucratic and administrative discretion, what remains is not participation but performance. The Court can scarcely supervise every line on the roll, but it must ensure that the manner of its preparation meets our exacting constitutional standards.\nIn India’s founding moment, the electoral roll was an act of republican recognition. As Ornit Shani has shown in her book, How India Became Democratic: Citizenship And The Making Of The Universal Franchise, it was built not by excluding the undocumented but by bureaucrats striving to find and register them. The presumption then was that people belonged. That presumption now hangs in the balance. It is for the Court to decide whether it still holds.\nSuhrith Parthasarathy is an advocate practising in the Madras High Court"

A special squad of the Perumbavoor Assistant Superintendent of Police made the seizure on a tip-off received by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) M. Hemalatha.\nReportedly, they smuggled in suspected ganja from Odisha to Aluva by train. From there they reached the Perumbavoor KSRTC bus stand. They were on their way to their rented house at Vattakkattupady in an autorickshaw when they were intercepted by the police team.\nThe accused had been under surveillance for some time. Seetharam and Pola are siblings and the other two their wives. According to the police, the accused used to sell ganja bought in Odisha for ₹3,000 a kilogram for ₹25,000 here and then left with the proceeds.\nThey used to visit Kerala once or twice every month and had even rented a house at Vattakkattupady to avert suspicion. They created the impression that they worked in a plywood company, the police said.\nFurther probe is under way."

Envisioned as a CoE under IIM-K’s ‘Vision 2047’ and aligned with the aspirations of India’s National Education Policy [NEP], the Centre aims to become a crucible for cutting-edge pedagogy, publishing excellence, and knowledge sharing grounded in Indian wisdom and global best practices,” he added.\nProfessor Atanu Adhikari, the founding Head of Gyanodaya, said, “Gyanodaya is built on the tenets of pedagogical excellence, global relevance, and the sharing of indigenous knowledge. We aim to establish a win-win-win model — where learners, authors, and institutions benefit symbiotically.”\nGyanodaya addresses both immediate and long-term academic needs. In the short term, it focuses on developing and disseminating peer-reviewed content, including case studies, simulations, monographs, books, and research notes. Over time, the Centre aims to become a global hub for educational innovation, fostering collaboration among institutions, faculty, and practitioners worldwide.\nThe centre has already made a strong start — over 30 original case studies, accompanied by detailed teaching notes, have been published, spanning disciplines from marketing and finance to the humanities and liberal arts.\nTo maintain academic integrity and publishing efficiency, the centre operates with the support of Pandulipi, a home-grown online manuscript management platform developed by IIM-K’s web team. The platform facilitates seamless submissions and incorporates a three-stage peer review system, with reviewers chosen for both domain expertise and pedagogical insight."

    "content": "The authorities at Calicut University (CU) have sought to clear the reported confusion over the selection of minor (subsidiary) courses for the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUGP) in affiliated colleges.\nIn a circular to college principals issued on July 14, Dinoj Sebastian, Registrar, said that students pursuing major (main) courses with minor courses must choose all of them from two minor groups offered by a discipline other than their major discipline.\nMr. Sebastian pointed out that the directive followed the recent amendments to certain clauses in the regulations for the FYUGP and their subsequent approval by the university’s Academic Council and the Senate. The circular said that the students pursuing FYUGP, including those programmes which were previously granted certain exemptions from the selection of minor courses, would not be permitted to choose them in their major discipline, from the 2025 academic year.\nEarlier this month, Vice-Chancellor (V-C) P. Raveendran had set up a committee to address the alleged practical difficulties in the selection of minor courses under the FYUGP in small colleges and in specific subjects such as commerce. Some teachers’ organisations had pointed out that the revision of the clauses in the FYUGP regulations would curtail the students’ freedom to choose minor courses in a different discipline from the same department that offers the major (main) course. They also claimed that the revision would force students to pick minor courses they might not like to study, and this was likely to happen in small colleges offering a limited number of subjects.\nMr. Sebastian toldThe Hinduon Wednesday (July 16, 2025) that the circular was issued to clear the air over the issue. “The committee is looking into the concerns raised over the selection of minor courses. If it proposes any exemptions for certain colleges, it will be examined in future course,” he added.\nMeanwhile, the Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association (KPCTA) claimed that the Registrar had shown an unwanted hurry to issue the circular. It was issued just ahead of a proposed meeting of the committee. KPCTA functionaries urged the V-C to put the circular on hold till the committee submit its proposals."

The police are verifying whether the other two – Saddam, 38, from Mewat in Haryana, and Najeer Ahammed, 33, from Nuh in Haryana – have any criminal antecedents.\nA team from the Tamil Nadu police interrogated the accused at the Panangad police station on Wednesday (July 16, 2025).  According to police sources, the accused was into vehicle theft using the container trailer engaged for delivery of cargo. Even in the instant case, the car was stolen while en route to Nettoor within the Panangad police station limits to deliver air conditioners.\nThe stolen vehicle is then used to carry out thefts locally before abandoning it to flee with the theft proceeds. The police also suspect the gang to be into ATM robbery after gas cutter and other such equipment were recovered from the trailer.\nThe State control room of the police had on Monday (July 14, 2025) midnight issued an alert that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of being involved in the theft of a car from Krishnagiri had crossed the border into Kerala. The Panangad police found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque under suspicious circumstances with three persons inside on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) at around 3.30 a.m.\nShortly after the suspects were brought to the Panangad police station, Najeer, on the pretext of a bathroom break, reportedly bolted the toilet from inside and fled by breaking down the toilet window. However, he was chased down by the police.\nIn the ensuing interrogation, the accused reportedly confessed to have stolen the car by driving it inside the trailer. They had kept the car hidden in Krishnagiri itself. The Tamil Nadu police recovered the car."

Once the uploading is complete, we will be able to access the biodiversity features of all 21 wards in Kodenchery at the click of a mouse,” says Alex Thomas Chembakassery, president of the panchayat. He adds that the digitised version will also update the earlier register, which was prepared with only basic information in 2014.\nMr. Chembakassery says the digitised register will contain more specific and comprehensive information on traditional medical practices, agricultural activities, and local biodiversity attractions. In the case of Kodenchery, details of indigenous medicines promoted by tribespeople will be a major highlight, he adds.\nEnumerators involved in the field-level survey say efforts are under way to collect micro-level details of traditional agricultural practices, high-yielding local seed varieties, and unique forest resources. They add that documenting various species of butterflies is also under consideration, with support from experts.\nTo ensure the record is authentic for future reference and planning, the involvement of experienced officers from the Forest department has been secured. Researchers from the Botany and Zoology departments of various colleges will also contribute to validating the data before its online release."

    "content": "Drains along M.G. Road will be widened enough to increase their carrying capacity to accommodate water from intense spells of rain within a short period as experienced during recent years.\nThis will be one of the works to be undertaken by the Public Works department (PWD) using the ₹10 crores to be sanctioned under Operation Breakthrough (OBT). Renovated drains with footpath atop and twin duct for utilities, including one exclusively for the KSEB, will be part of the works. The PWD will seek technical sanction once the amount is credited to its account.\nOut of the 9.40-km stretch of M.G. Road, 2.60 km from Pharmacy Junction is likely to be covered in the initial phase. The PWD prefers a left side-oriented work considering that more shops are on that side, and, therefore, pedestrians are also likely to be more there.\n“M.G. Road has traditionally suffered from lack of flow of water through the drain leading to waterlogging warranting slope correction. Also, the unscientific installation of prefabricated drains on an existing drain has affected the proper drainage of water into the drains, which also need to be corrected. Missing slabs on the footpath also need to be replaced,” said Mayor M. Anilkumar.\nThe works will be carried out in accordance with a detailed project report (DPR) for drains along M.G. Road, prepared by the PWD two years ago after the Mayor wrote to the Public Works Minister. However, as per the DPR, the total cost of the works is ₹16 crore. “A meeting will be held with the Minister to explore ways to secure the remaining ₹6 crore needed to complete the project,” said Mr. Anilkumar.\nA proposal worth around ₹20 crores for laying an eastern-centric outlet to discharge water from the drains directly to the backwaters also remains pending. At present, the discharge outlet through M.G. Road is west-centric. The proposal is to draw an outlet from near the South railway station across M.G. Road directly to the backwaters through DH Road.\nA majority of OBT works have been focused on the restoration of Mullassery Canal, resolving waterlogging near High Court Junction, and the construction of a culvert at Kammattipadam."

Station House Officers will also review each group’s activities and issue necessary guidelines.\n“The presence of community members such as auto-rickshaw drivers and headload workers makes SPGs a strong platform for the police to gather accurate information on student-related law and order issues. The initiative now covers students from Upper Primary to Higher Secondary levels,” says Mr. Umesh. He adds that all 17 police stations in Kozhikode city are working closely with the SPG units to ensure swift action.\nSPG coordinators from various city schools confirm that more active members from diverse sectors will be inducted to ensure the full-fledged functioning of the groups, in line with the guidelines of the social policing division. As the initiative is part of a State-level police programme for students, the Department of Education is also keen on monitoring its implementation and outcomes at the school level, they add."

This would be PM Modi’s fifth visit to the state since January this year. TheBihar Assembly electionswill be held in October-November this year.\n“Whenever he [PM Modi] comes to Bihar, people have huge expectations, and he does not let them down. In his earlier four visits to the State PM Modi had announced multiple projects for the development of Bihar,” said state BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal, who, along with other senior party leaders has regularly been visiting Motihari to oversee preparations for the PM’s visit on Friday (July 18). The PM is scheduled to address a public meeting at Gandhi Maidan in Motihari. “This would be PM Modi’s 53rdvisit to Bihar and sixth to Motihari in the last 11 years. For earlier Prime Ministers, Bihar was never a priority,” Mr. Jaiswal added. He will unveil projects related to rail, roads, rural development, and housing at the public meeting.\nEarlier the PM had visited Bhagalpur, Madhubani, Rohtas, and Siwan districts to address public meetings while unveiling and laying foundation stones for projects worth several thousand crores. The PM will also flag off three trains.\nFormer BJP MP from East Champaran Radha Mohan Singh said that “people from as many as 24 assembly constituencies of the region are likely to participate on Friday, to make it an unparalleled event.”\nDistrict administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the forthcoming visit of the Prime Minister at Motihari. “As many as 15 IPS officers, over four dozen Dy SPs, 100 Inspector rank officials, and over 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel will be deployed during the PM’s visit,” a senior police official at the state headquarters in Patna said. Top administrative officials have already visited the place, he added.\n“The Prime Minister’s visit to East Champaran will definitely enthuse and boost the morale of our grassroots party leaders and workers. Yes, the PM is our star campaigner for the party ahead of the assembly elections,” a state BJP leader asserted. “He will keep coming before the polls, and his visits will definitely, uplift our party leaders and workers’ morale,” he added. Several public meetings have been scheduled for the Prime Minister in Bihar over the next two months, ahead of the assembly elections.\nMeanwhile, Opposition leaders see nothing “unusual” in the Prime Minister’s regular visits to the election-bound State. “This is an election year, and every party leader is expected to address public meetings. But the Prime Minister should also speak about basic issues of unemployment, and migration, confronting the State. Of late, the law-and-order situation in the State has become alarming, and the PM must say something on this as well,” leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said. Mr. Yadav has regularly been raising public issues and making announcements on providing jobs and promoting industrialisation in the state. “But the Prime Minister will keep talking about the jungle raj issue to mislead common people,” RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said.\nOpposition leaders also wanted the PM to address the “chaos & confusion” caused by the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state, the RJD leaders said. Earlier, Mr. Yadav had accused the Election Commission of “working on behalf of the BJP.”\nJD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar countered, “He is the Prime Minister of the country, not only Bihar. He has to look after the development of the State along with the country. We welcome his visit to the state.”"

    "content": "Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday said the Union Territory has been making rapid strides on the path of peace and prosperity under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, achieving all-inclusive growth and social justice, since theabrogation of Article 370in 2019.\nWhile delivering a special lecture on “Jammu and Kashmir Towards Peace” at Gandhi Smriti, at an event presided over by former Union Minister and Gandhi Smriti vice-chairman Vijay Goel, the Lieutenant-Governor said over the past five years, Jammu and Kashmir’s economy had more than doubled.\nMr. Sinha said under the Prime Minister’s visionary leadership, the region was now connected to other parts of the country through railways. There was a massive increase in the influx of tourists with more than 5,000 new hotels constructed over the past four years in Kashmir valley itself. Several infrastructure projects were being implemented and many social welfare programmes launched.\nA key indicator of development was the ₹1,700-crore profit booked by J&K Bank, which had previously suffered a loss of about ₹1,300 crore. Taking advantage of the incentives being provided by the government, a large number of startups were now coming up. Several premier educational institutions had been set up for the local youth, which was committed to peace, prosperity, unity, and communal harmony in the region.\nMr. Sinha said there was a fair and peaceful conduct of Assembly elections in J&K. “No political party raised any doubt about the election process,” he said, adding that the Panchayati Raj system had also been implemented across the UT successfully.\nThe Lieutenant Governor said after the abrogation of Article 370, no stone pelting incident was reported in the past few years. While earlier, terror outfits would radicalise and recruit an average of about 150 local youth per year, only six such instances were reported last year, and just one so far this year, which was a testimony to the fact that J&K residents were pro-development, he said.\nTerming the Pahalgam terror attack a conspiracy by Pakistan to trigger communal unrest and once again destabilise J&K, he said there was a spontaneous protest by the locals against the killings.\nMr. Sinha said Operation Sindoor displayed the capability of the armed forces to deliver a befitting response to the Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, and that too using indigenous defence systems. “Since Partition, terrorism has been the State policy of Pakistan,” he said, adding that the international community should work together to eliminate breeding grounds of terrorism."

    "content": "India may have achieved an important milestone of sourcing 50% of its total electric power capacity of about 484 gigawatts, from non fossil-fuel sources, though publicly available data show that the share of clean energy in the electricity actually supplied is below 30%.\n“India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources — five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] to the Paris Agreement,” Pralhad Joshi, Minister for New and Renewable Energy, said earlier this week. “This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development, and signals that India’s clean energy transition is not only real but also accelerating under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”\nIn 2014, the share of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, biomass, hydropower (small and large) and nuclear power – constituted about 30% of India’s installed electricity capacity. As on June 30, 2025 – as per the Centre – it rose to 50%. However, the share of electricity generated from these sources rose from 17% in 2014-15 to 28% in the April 2024 to May 2025 period.\nTo be sure, the quantum of clean energy (non-fossil) produced annually has risen quite significantly from 190 billion units in 2014-15 to 460 billion units in 2024-25.\nExperts say that despite the rise in clean energy, the slower increase in utilising clean energy was due to the “capacity utilisation factor” (CUF), a measure of how much available energy was usable. CUF values for clean energy have been lower than that of coal or nuclear sources. “While solar and wind now make up a large share of installed capacity, their CUFs are much lower. Solar has CUF of approximately 20% and wind around 25-30%, compared to coal’s 60% or nuclear’s 80%. This means their contribution to actual generation remains limited despite high installed capacity,” said Arunendra Kumar Tiwari, Fellow, The Energy Resources Institute.\nBase load demand, or power that is available through the day, is largely provided by coal, which makes up about 75% of India’s energy mix. While there was a rise in solar energy utilisation and easing demand on coal during the daytime, particularly in summer, was unavailable in the evening.\n“To improve utilisation of solar, we primarily need two things: flexibility in the grid and improved battery storage. Right now we pay the same (per unit) for electricity, whether night or day. Much like in the early days of telecom, when night calls were cheaper, we need to experiment with differential tarrifs for electricity during the day.\nThis however will require smart grids and better management,” said Saurabh Kumar, vice-president, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and an expert on energy, “We have several schemes that are being working on and in the next one or two years, I expect there will be significant improvement.”\nIn the days ahead, an increase in ‘hybrid’ power projects that combine solar, wind, hydro and storage elements to meet India’s growing peak and round-the-clock power needs are the way forward, says a policy note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “When paired with battery storage, these hybrids can store surplus energy and release it during peak demand hours, particularly in the evening. However, deployment is currently limited by challenges such as land-aggregation issues, lack of coordinated transmission planning, and high cost of storage components.”"

The total amount fraudulently withdrawn is said to be ₹8.71 lakh.\nThe arrested duo were identified as Jogula Naresh Kumar, 42, a grocery store owner from Mettuguda, and Balagoni Venkatesh, 37, working as an office subordinate at the Mandal Parishad Development Officer (MPDO) office in Nalgonda. Two others, Korlapati Vamshi, 24, a car driver from Khammam, and Pulipaka Omkar, 34, a driver from Godavarikhani, remain absconding, along with other suspected accomplices.\nAccording to Inspector of Jubilee Hills police K.Venkateshwara Reddy, main accused Naresh Kumar had access to CMRF cheques while working at a minister’s office. “With the new government coming into power in the 2023 elections, he unlawfully retained 230 sanctioned but undistributed cheques. Nineteen of those cheques, issued to applicants who had not followed up, were allegedly deposited in forged bank accounts with similar names at the SBI branch on Road No. 5 in Jubilee Hills,” explained the officer, adding that the amount was divided among the accused.\nNaresh Kumar and Venkatesh were apprehended on July 14 and remanded to judicial custody the following day. The other accused are on the run. The group is also linked to at least three earlier cases registered in 2024 at the same police station for similar offences involving forgery, cheating, criminal breach of trust and cybercrime."

    "content": "Ozone pollution spiked in several parts of Hyderabad this summer, but it was the industrial belt of Bolarum that saw the worst of it.\nBetween March 1 and May 31, Bolarum recorded 17 days when ground-level ozone levels breached the safe limit — the highest in the city — according to a research paper published by the Centre for Science and Environment titled ‘An invisible threat: Ground-level ozone – Metro cities’ based on a study by Anumita Roychowdhury and Sharanjeet Kaur.\nThe study tracked air quality in five major cities — Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata-Howrah, Bengaluru and Chennai — using data from 80 stations under the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS).\nAs per the study, Bolarum is most chronically affected by ground-level ozone pollution, and exceeded the standard for 17 days in the study period. While the standard is 100 μg/m³ (micrograms per cubic metre of air), the levels of ozone nearly touched 140 μg/m³ on the days mentioned.\nThere were no exceedances at other stations in the city barring ICRISAT which exceeded the standard for two days and Ramachandrapuram which exceeded for one day, totalling to 20 days of ozone exceedance in the city. The days of exceedance in Hyderabad were more concentrated between May 2 and 20. Good news is that the figure is 55% lower than what was recorded last summer.\nA comparison of May 2025 with May 2024 reveals that ground-level ozone is now lingering in the atmosphere even after sunset, and the average hourly ozone peak is 3% higher than last year, the study noted.\nAt 45, Bengaluru recorded the highest number of days with ozone exceedance. Mumbai recorded  32 days, Kolkata 22 days, and Chennai recorded the lowest at 15 days.\nUnlike primary pollutants which are emitted directly from sources such as vehicles and industries, ground level ozone is formed through intricate chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide, which are the pollutants released by vehicles, power plants, factories and other combustion sources, the study said.\nIn the presence of sunlight, these substances undergo a series of cyclic reactions that result in the ozone formation near the ground. VOCs also have natural sources such as vegetation adding to the complexity, which explains the higher levels at ICRISAT.\nWhat’s more threatening is that the ground level ozone can travel long distances, turning into a regional pollutant. It impacts agricultural productivity, threatening food security. Ozone is a highly reactive gas which can be harmful even with short duration exposure, and result in serious public health crisis, the study warned.\nGround level ozone can inflame and damage the airways, increase susceptibility to infections and worsen respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Children with underdeveloped lungs, order adults and people with existing respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable.\nHyderabad is prone to experience ozone exceedances during winter too, driven by cold, stagnant conditions and poor vertical mixing. But this winter, there was substantial improvement, with the city recording just nine days of exceedance which is a sharp decline from 43 days recorded during the winter of 2024, the study observed."

The agency seized mobile phones, documents used to open bank accounts, transaction records, and KYC papers.\n“The operation has led to the arrest of three individuals for their active role in facilitating and operating mule bank accounts used to channel and conceal proceeds of various cyber frauds,” it said.\nActing on specific information, the CBI registered a case on June 25 against 37 accused persons, including mule account holders, middlemen, and bank employees who allegedly colluded with cybercriminals. The agency carried out two rounds of searches at 40 locations in different States on June 26-27 and arrested 10 accused persons.\n“The CBI has adopted a strategic approach in the fight against cybercrime, focusing on targeting the key pillars of the cybercrime infrastructure. The first pillar is the financial infrastructure, involving mule accounts, unauthorised payment gateways, and the wider fintech ecosystem misused by cybercriminals. The second pillar is the telecom/communication infrastructure involving mule SIM cards, point-of-sale (PoS) agents facilitating illegal SIM activations, and networks supplying such SIM cards,” said the agency.\nIt said, “The third pillar is the human resource network, which consists of organised syndicates engaged in the recruitment and exploitation of people to execute cybercrimes, otherwise known as ‘cyber slavery.’ The third pillar most of the time operates outside the boundaries of India.”"

    "content": "Kolkata:\nThe Calcutta High Court has dismissed all the petitions regarding the School Service Commission (SSC)‘s new recruitment notification where ‘untainted’ teachers who lost their jobs after the Supreme Court ruling had petitioned against many of the subject seats being reduced, and the eligibility criteria of the 2025 exams being different from 2016 making the process harder for older candidates.\nThe division bench of Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Smita Das De delivered the judgement on Wednesday (July 16, 2025). They said that they will not interfere in the new notification issued by the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) new recruitment notification. A week back, Justice Saugata Bhattacharya of Calcutta High Court had only said that the government must take out the ‘tainted’ candidates out of the new examination; this judgement was upheld at the division bench ruling on Wednesday.\nMehboob Mondal, a representative of the ‘Joggya Sikkhak Sikkhika Adhikar Mancha’ (Deserving Teachers’ Rights Forum) toldThe Hinduthat the new rules of the 2025 recruitment is not allowing special B.Ed. candidates to fill up forms, even candidates with 40-45% marks are barred, but all of them had cracked the exams in 2016. This has left them in the lurch, even though they have served in schools as untainted teachers for over seven years. He also added that some subjects like Chemistry or Nepali language have no seats in 2025 exams, but the same teachers got jobs in 2016, now they have no option but to skip the exams and lose their jobs.\n“We had petitioned that we should not have to compete with fresh candidates because we had already passed the exam. The 2016 panel should have been separately recruited. We are losing all faith in the judiciary because they failed us and we are being punished and losing jobs because of the government’s corruption,” Habibullah, a representative of JSSAM said.\nHe also shared doubts that the same WBSSC body, which was caught in a corrupt recruitment process by the Supreme Court, has been directed to conduct the rehiring process. “What is the guarantee that they will not steal our jobs again? Finding the tainted candidates cannot be our responsibility. It was either the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) responsibility or the government’s responsibility, why are we being criminalised for their lacking?” Mr Habibullah added.\nPreviously, the JSSAM representatives had said that they were against filling out the new recruitment form because they are ‘untainted’ candidates, the last date for which is July 21. They wanted a review petition at the Supreme Court before the last date, but it has not yet been listed. According to the representatives, this has led to a section of the ‘untainted’ teachers filling up the new recruitment form to stay on the safe side, so they have a shot at getting back to their old jobs.\nAfter the verdict was announced, state lawyer and Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee called it a victory for the state. “The court has recognized the state’s rights. The Supreme Court has said that the recruitment process has to be started according to the 2016 recruitment process. The court did not accept the unreasonable request. We also have to consider how many people have come in the last nine years,” Mr Banerjee added.\nAccording to the last WBSSC notification for the 2025 recruitment, the experienced teachers will get a 10 marks advantage. This is the only leeway that the 2016 panel of teachers will get in the fresh hiring process.\nThe petitions were in response to the Supreme Court ruling, which upheld the cancellation of approximately 26,000 appointments made during the 2016 recruitment process conducted by the WBSSC, citing irregularities.\nOn April 17, the top court allowed ‘untainted’ candidates to continue in service until December 31, or until a fresh selection process is completed."

They include Dharavath Rajkumar, a dancer, Kaluvala Abhilash Reddy and Alladi Tharun, both private sector employees, and Gattu Pavan, also working in Hyderabad. All were identified as account suppliers or holders,” said the officer.\nThe case came to light when the victim, a woman, received an automated call on November 12 last year, claiming that her Airtel services would be suspended. She was then transferred through a chain of fraudsters posing as various officials, a woman operator, a DCP and a CBI officer named Rajesh Mishra. They accused her of involvement in a money laundering case linked to Naresh Goyal and claimed that she held illicit bank accounts in Mumbai.\nThe victim, after realising she had been duped, approached the Cyber Crime Police in Hyderabad, prompting the registration of the case under serious sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\nThe group’s modus operandi was to impersonate enforcement agencies like the CBI, ED or Customs, allege fictitious criminal cases such as terrorism or narcotics trafficking, and then psychologically corner the victims into draining their financial reserves. Victims were told the money was to be ‘deposited with the Supreme Court’ to prove their innocence.\nPolice seized a smartphone used in the crime and a Visa Platinum debit card belonging to an absconding Dubai-based accused, Ashok Kumar Javvaji, reportedly running a digital marketing outfit."

Chandrababu Naidu called it a comprehensive blueprint for the State’s economic growth, and that, having achieved the targets laid down in the Vision-2020 document, the government set for itself more ambitious goals now.\nHe said the Swarna Andhra Pradesh vision was in alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Viksit Bharat-2047, and highlighted the importance of innovation and policy reforms.\nMr. Naidu said A.P. had strong and dynamic human resources and fertile land, and was rich in agricultural commodities, especially horticulture, aquaculture, and commercial crops.\nThe State was leveraging those advantages and top priority was given to infrastructure, and asserted that A.P. would be the logistics hub of India.\nThe Chief Minister called upon the affluent sections to invest in people as capital and support the weaker sections so that they would be economically empowered.\nHe noted that Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada had secured the first and third spots in LinkedIn’s first-ever ‘Cities on the Rise’ report, which highlighted India’s fastest-growing non-metro cities for professional growth.\nFrom WhatsApp governance to AI-driven healthcare, the Chief Minister emphasised the role of technology in improving lives, and cited the success of the pilot project of digitisation of health records in Kuppam, developed in partnership with the Tata Group.\nOn the occasion, Mr. Naidu assured industrialists of full support, and thanked the task force Chairman N.

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday unveiled the report of the Task Force on Economic Development for Swarna Andhra Pradesh @ 2047 as its Chairman in a programme jointly organised by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in New Delhi.\nCo-chaired by TATA Sons Executive Chairman N. Chandrasekharan, the expert panel made a host of recommendations to the government on diverse sectors that had the potential to catapult it to the league of progressive States.\nThe task force stated in its report that India emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world and was expected to be a developed economy by 2047, but its journey towards a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by the 100th year of Independence hinged significantly on how the States perform individually and drive the economic growth agenda.\nIn this context, it had been noted that with the third longest coastline in the country and one of the largest land banks, Andhra Pradesh was at a comparative advantage to become one of the champions of the country’s overall goal of achieving around US$ 35 trillion target over the next two decades. A.P.’s economy had more than doubled to US$ 174 billion in 2023-24 from US$ 86 billion (at current prices) in 2014-15 in spite of the challenges posed by the bifurcation in 2014.\nThe task force felt that though there were some gaps to be filled, A.P. was well poised to take the leap in its developmental journey towards a Swarna Andhra Pradesh by 2047.\nIt was pointed out that the top 15 districts — Visakhapatnam, NTR, Tirupati, Krishna, Eluru, Nellore, Guntur, Anantapur, Kakinada, West Godavari, East Godavari, YSR, Sri Sathya Sai, Anakapalli and Prakasam — contributed as much as 72% to the State’s economy. They were expected to contribute nearly US$1.70 trillion to the State’s overall target of US$2.40 trillion in 2047.\nThe task force laid down industries such as food processing, marine and aquaculture, electronics, automotive, and life sciences sectors as the potential growth drivers, while noting that emerging opportunities, which included the blue economy,  would give a fillip to the growth prospects.\nIn terms of enablers, it was recommended that the State needed renewed focus on quality education and skills development.\nTowards restoring industry confidence, the task force suggested introduction of a legislative mechanism to protect already announced incentives and concessions, regardless of a change in political dispensation, prioritising the clearance of all overdue incentive pay outs to help restore industry’s faith in the system.\nExpressing concern that the State’s current fiscal scenario was a cause for concern, , the task force recommended to the government to set up an independent agency to monitor the compliance of fiscal responsibility legislation provisions, and a State Institutions of Transformation in collaboration with the NITI Aayog, to establish an independent public debt management cell in line with the recommendation of the Fifteenth Finance Commission, and to strengthen the State Finance Commission.\nThe experts said the government should leverage the Central government’s initiatives such as the Aspirational Districts Programme to facilitate healthy competition among districts, have a graded incentive structure for specific regions and a dedicated policy for accelerated creation of growth centres in the different regions, and reap the benefits of One District-One Product programme for promoting exports."

    "content": "Gujarat has become the first Indian State to launch a genome sequencing initiative focused exclusively on tribal communities.\nAt a high-level consultation chaired by State Tribal Development Minister Kuber Dindor here, the Tribal Genome Sequencing Project was announced with the aim of identifying genetic health risks and enabling precision healthcare for tribal populations. The initiative will sequence the genomes of 2,000 individuals from tribal communities across 17 districts in the State.\nThe project, titled “Creation of Reference Genome Database for Tribal Population in Gujarat”, is being implemented by the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) and is part of the 2025–26 State budget.\nMr. Dindor said the initiative will focus on early detection and targeted treatment of genetic disorders such as sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, and certain hereditary cancers.\n“This project will serve as a milestone — bridging the gap between science and tradition — toward a healthier and more prosperous future for our tribal communities,” he said. “It is not just a scientific initiative, but a focused campaign to bring long-term improvements in tribal health.”\nThe genetic data collected will also be used to identify markers related to natural immunity and support the development of personalised healthcare solutions. The project will incorporate advanced infrastructure for sample collection, sequencing, and interpretation of genetic data, officials said.\nExperts at the event stressed that the initiative is not limited to scientific research but aims to empower tribal communities through the use of advanced technology and data. The project will involve state-of-the-art facilities for sample collection and genetic analysis."

    "content": "The new Class 8 Social Science textbook of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) introduced to students in academic year 2025-26 describes the colonial rule of the European powers especially the British to be the one which “drained India of its wealth”.\nChapter 4 of the new NCERT textbookExploring Society: India and Beyondstates that, “…the Industrial Revolution in Britain, which required investment, was made possible at least partly by the ‘stolen wealth from India’.” ‘Stolen wealth from India’ is a phrase used by U.S. historian Will Durant, it states.\n“The general thrust of Britain’s dominance in India was plunder, exploitation, trade dominance, imposition of educational, administrative and judicial systems, and Christianization,” Michel Danino, Head, the NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science, toldThe Hindu.\nAn official statement released by the NCERT said, “All the facts presented in this textbook are based on well-known primary and secondary academic sources. However, in order to avoid generation of any prejudice and misunderstanding, “A note on history’s darker period’ at page 20 has been added.”\nThe note states, “While those happenings cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone today responsible for them...”\nThe fourth chapter goes on to include a quote by William Digby which states, “...Modern England has been made great by Indian wealth, ...wealth always taken by the might and skill of the stronger.”\n“A recent estimate for the wealth extracted out of India given by Indian economist Utsa Patnaik, in the period from 1765 to 1938, coming at 45 trillion U.S. dollars or about 13 times Britain’s GDP in 2023. Had this wealth remained invested in India, it would have been a very different country when it attained independence,” the chapter states.\n“This was extracted not just through taxes, but by charging Indians for the colonial power’s expenditures on building the railways, the telegraph network and even on wars!” the chapter further states.\n“In India, it is common to find the colonial period portrayed as a positive one, with the British bringing industries, railways, the telegraph, modern education, and so on. We have tried to correct this perspective by showing what really happened — the destruction of India’s indigenous industries and educational system, the enormous revenue extraction from the Indian population to finance railway and telegraph, etc,” Mr. Danino stated. “Of course we have also shown the other side — the opening up of India to the world and Europe’s discovery of India’s ancient culture, among others,” he further added.\nThe chapter also states that converting indigenous populations to Christianity was a powerful motivation (for territorial expansion of European powers). Colonisation led to loss of independence, exploitation of resources by the colonisers, destruction of traditional ways of life and the imposition of foreign cultural values, the new NCERT textbook states.\nPortugese navigator Vasco da Gama “seized, tortured and killed Indian merchants, and bombarded Calicut from sea,” the chapter states. “The Portuguese presence was characterised by religious persecution... of Hindus, Muslims, Jews and Christian converts...,” the chapter further says. It also highlights the destruction of Pondicherry’s original Vedapurishwaram temple, ordered by Joseph François Dupleix, Governor General of French India in 1748.\nThe chapter states that the British systematically dismantled indigenous governance systems of village communities and replaced them with a centralised bureaucracy. “While presented as modernisation, this imposition of a foreign system unsuited to India alienated Indians from the judicial system, creating courts that were expensive, time-consuming and conducted in a foreign language,” it states.\nThe chapter states that diverse educational traditions such aspadashalas, madrasasandviharastransmitted not only practical knowledge but also cultural values and traditions. It quotes from British reports which stated that hundreds of thousands of village schools were present across India (for instance, 1,00,000 to 1,50,000 of them in Bengal and Bihar) “where young natives are taught reading, writing and arithmetic, upon a system so economical ... and at the same time so simple and effectual...”\nAlso, the chapter states that the system education proposed by the British became a powerful tool for the creation of a class of Indians who would serve British interests; it quotes Thomas B. Macaulay who emphasised that “Indians needed British education... to create a class of Indians who would be Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, opinions, morals and intellect.”\nThe chapter goes on to say that while a few prominent British Orientalists argued that Indian students should be left to study in their own languages, Macaulay’s policy gained the upper hand and India’s traditional schools slowly disappeared, while English became a language of prestige associated with colonial masters. This resulted in lasting divisions in Indian society between English-educated elites and the masses.\n“It also sidelined traditional sources of knowledge and authority, creating generations of Indians disconnected from their own cultural heritage,” the chapter states.\nThe new NCERT textbook, unlike the earlier ones that made a passing reference to the Marathas, has now introduced an entire chapter dedicated to ‘The Rise of the Marathas’.\n“In effect, the British took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals or any other power,” the NCERT textbook states. Marathas have been described as “a powerful political entity that will alter the course of India’s history”. The chapter talks about Shivaji’s need to establish a navy as a “revolutionary step” and his exploits as “legendary”.\nThe chapter goes on to state that when Shivaji attacked Surat, which was a wealthy port city in Mughal Empire, he obtained an enormous treasure of almost one crore rupees, but was careful not to attack religious places. In contrast, the Mughal rulers (like Babur, Akbar and Aurangzeb) have been described as “brutal” in the previous chapter titled ‘Reshaping India’s Political Map’. The chapter says they “destroyed temples” and their rule was fraught with “religious intolerance.”\nIn contrast, Shivaji has been described as “a devout Hindu... who rebuilt desecrated temples, promoted Sanskrit and Marathi literature, religious institutions and traditional arts”.\nAhilyabai Holkar, an 18th century Maratha ruler, has been described as “a devout person who built and restored hundreds of temples, ghats, wells and roads throughout India, from Kedarnath in north to Rameswaram in south. She rebuilt the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi that had been destroyed by Aurangzeb and Somnath temple in Gujarat destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni,” the chapter states.\n“Class 8 being the last year of the middle stage, the students are expected to acquire a broad multi-perspective understanding of our past between 13th to mid-19th century and how the various events of that period have helped shape and influenced the evolution of India of today,” a official statement from the NCERT said.\n“This textbook attempts to provide an idea about the geography, history (medieval & modern), economic life and governance of the country, from a multi-disciplinary perspective in an integrated way,” it says.\n“Our aim has been to consistently avoid attempting to load the child with too much information and to develop a critical understanding of the subject. Hence , the various facts, have been presented in a comprehensible manner to promote holistic learning in this textbook,” the statement further said."

A data bank of these contract killers will be maintained to check their activities in future,” Mr. Krishnan said.\nHe added that a “dossier” will be prepared of each contract killer and the cell will keep their physical description, photograph, along with their name, address and other details so that their movement can be tracked even after coming out of jail.\nEven police personnel in districts have been asked to keep a tab on such contract killers.\n“Police have identified 1290 persons who have acquired proceeds of crime and their assets will be seized soon,”Mr. Krishnan said.\nHe also informed that the state police have also sent its proposal for starting Fast Track Courts (FTCs) to ensure speedy trial to achieve conviction in heinous crime cases.\nMr. Krishnan pointed out that the Narcotics Cell under STF is already functional but to strengthen it further, police are planning to set up a separate “narcotics & prohibition division” for which a proposal will be sent to the state cabinet.\nHe stressed that the move would help in taming the problem of opium, heroin, smack and other psychotropic substances being used by the youths of the state.\nTalking about murders that took place recently in the state, Krishnan said that the statistics does not suggest that the average crime graph has witnessed an increase.\n“This is an election year and a narrative is being built through misinformation and disinformation. No one should try to demoralise the police department as it has always identified and taken action against “black sheep’s,”Mr. Krishnan said.\nMeanwhile, the Bihar Police also suspended a station house officer (SHO) for dereliction of duty in connection with the murder of Patna based industrialist Gopal Khemka.\nThe order of suspension of Gandhi Maidan Police Station SHO Rajesh Kumar was issued by Patna Inspector General (IG) Jitendra Rana.\nMr. Khemka was murdered on July 4 night outside his houseunder the jurisdiction of Gandhi Maidan police station which was 300 meters from the spot. Earlier relatives and family members of Mr. Khemka had alleged that the police had reached the spot after one and half hours of the incident after the shooter fled.\n“When the incident took place, I had given the order to investigate the role of the local police and in the investigation the Patna SSP found that Gandhi Maidan SHO did not perform his duty. If there would be any more officers involved, action would be taken accordingly,” Mr. Rana said while speaking to the media.\nIn the case, police have already arrested the shooter Umesh Yadav and mastermind Ashok Sao who had given theSupuri(contract) of Rs 4 lakh to kill the industrialist who was also earlier associated with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."

However, we will also include the missing person issue in “Police Kaka” and “Police Didi”, which campaign for good touch-bad touch and other initiatives.”\nMr. Danve suggested that the government conduct a social study to understand the cause, rather than treating it as a job. “There are hotspots from where women go missing; these areas lack visible policing. The impact on ground level is only possible if it is seen as a social responsibility. Besides, these issues are to be seen from social angles, including child marriage and sexual violence,” he added.\nThe issue of missing women was raised in the assembly after Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Sunil Shinde asked for the status of the proposal to ‘Track missing women’.\n“All states are connected to the Centre’s missing women portal. The progress will be used to file a consolidated report,” Mr. Fadnavis responded.\nCiting Nagpur’s case, Mr. Fadnavis said, “5897 women were missing, out of which 5210 were traced. This means 90% of the cases were traced. However, a problem arises in 4 to 5% of cases, which goes on the back burner.”\nTo resolve this issue, Mr. Fadnavis has asked to establish a missing cell at each police station to keep track of these cases and an IPS-level officer to review the work every two months."

    "content": "Police teams in Hyderabad and Medak have intensified efforts to track down the suspects behind two separate shootings that occurred within a span of 12 hours. In both cases, investigators are probing rivalries and financial disputes as potential motives.\nIn the Medak incident, Congress leader Marelli Anil was shot dead on the night of July 14 while returning to his village in a luxury SUV. The attack occurred near Kulcharam around 9 p.m. According to the police, Anil was intercepted and ambushed by assailants in two cars. Four bullets were found in his body and four empty shells recovered from the scene. Investigators confirmed the use of .32 calibre pistol in the attack.\nPolice suspect that the killing was linked to a real estate mediation that turned hostile. Anil is said to have maintained a network of ten men who operated through a WhatsApp group titled ‘Janata Garage’. The group handled recoveries of money and financial disputes on commission. According to senior officers, Anil’s involvement in illegal financial dealings and multiple rivalries could have led to his murder.\nTwelve special teams have been formed by Medak police to trace the attackers. CCTV footage confirmed that Anil’s SUV was flanked by two other cars. The attackers, believed to be four to five in number, have been identified and are currently on the run.\nIn the Malakpet shooting incident in Hyderabad, police are still searching for four suspects involved in the murder of State Council member Chandu Naik.\nNaik was gunned down during his morning walk in Shalivahana Nagar Park, Malakpet, on the morning of July 15. Malakpet police, working with the Hyderabad Commissioner’s Task Force, have deployed nine teams to locate the suspects. Officials believe all four are within city limits and have switched off their phones to avoid detection.\n“Nine teams consisting of law and order staff and Task Force officers are working to trace the accused. Their mobile phones have been off since the morning of the incident, and all exit routes are being monitored,” an officer from Malakpet police station said.\nPolice recovered five shells at the scene, including three fired rounds and two that had misfired, indicating that a crude or country-made firearm may have been used. The vehicle used in the attack has been seized, and forensic analysis is ongoing.\nPolice in both districts have stated that further leads are being developed, and arrests are expected soon."

    "content": "The West Bengal government has once again, without explanation, extended the last date for admission to undergraduate courses in colleges run and aided by it, placing in limbo the future of thousands of students who are eagerly waiting to begin college life.\nIn a circular issued on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) afternoon, the Department of Higher Education said that the last date for submitting applications through the centralised portal, already extended from July 1 to July 15, was being further extended to July 25.\nAs it is there was a long delay in the opening of the centralised portal —introduced only last year — because West Bengal’s list of communities eligible for reservation under OBC category is caught in a legal tangle and a hearing is expected in the Supreme Court towards the end of this month. The fresh extension has pushed back the admission process by almost a month so far, whereas first-year classes in many private and autonomous institutions are about to begin.\n“The centralised admission portal has not collected ‘category’ details in accordance with the order of the Calcutta High Court dated June 17, which put an interim stay on a new list of OBC communities prepared by the State Government. As the special leave petition related to this matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court, proper data collection during the application process cannot be completed at this stage. The extension of the application deadline is primarily due to this legal situation,” a professor of a State Government-run college, who requested anonymity for himself and the college, said.\n“While the extension (of the last date for form submission) may allow for a few additional applications, the increase is not expected to be significant. As a result, the admission process may be delayed, potentially affecting the teaching-learning schedule for the upcoming academic session,” the professor said.\nMany in academic circles are convinced that the delay in wrapping up the admission process is also because seats are not filling up sufficiently this year, primarily because many students are headed to private/autonomous institutions or to other States for higher education. Whatever the actual reason for this unspecified delay, the future of lakhs of students who finished school this year is in a limbo at the moment.\n“As a working mother I am agonising over the fact that the process of admission is unlikely to end in July whereas other institutions representing minorities or which do not fall under the purview of centralised portal are conducting their admission tests and have declared that the first semester classes will start from August 1. Many parents like me have been forced to make our children secure a seat in these colleges for the time being even though we would ideally like them to study in a reputed government college,” said a State Government employee whose daughter has registered with the centralised portal and at the same time applied in a reputed Kolkata-based private institution.\n“The State Government should have resolved the OBC reservation issue before the centralised portal went live. Parents have no clue how long the admission process will take to be complete and whether the children should simultaneously apply in private colleges, where education is far more expensive. This delay is creating unnecessary anxiety and annoyance for parents,” the employee said, requesting not to be named."

All you get from there is a gun.” Mr. Rane’s comments came in response to the Congress reportedly starting Marathipathshalas(schools) in several parts of Mumbai.\nHis comments have drawn criticism from the Opposition, who claim he is spreading hatred with “inflammatory” comments.\nCondemning the remark, NCP-SP State president Shashikant Shinde said, “Mr. Rane, being a Minister, should raise such issues in the Cabinet and not publicly; who is stopping him?”\nNCP-SP leader Rohit Pawar called Mr. Rane’s remarks politically motivated, similar to the Hindu-Muslim card used in the Lok Sabha elections, and Marathi versus non-Marathi in local polls . “It is the Home Ministry’s duty to investigate whether the madrassa has guns or bombs. Mr. Rane should not divide people for politics, or fuel communal sentiments,” said Mr. Pawar.\nAIMIM leader Waris Pathan also slammed Mr. Rane for creating unrest in the name of language and religion. “BJP leaders are spreading hatred for the political gains in Maharashtra, he added.”\nCongress Leader Amin Patel said madrasasalready use English, Hindi, and Marathi, while azaanis in Arabic. Language and religion are two different things. “Is Nitesh Rane himself taking any Marathi classes?” he asked sarcastically."

    "content": "Ahead of the assembly election, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked the Education Department to count the vacant post in the government school to conduct the Teachers Recruitment Test 4 (TRE-4) so that recruitment of teachers could be done as soon as possible.\nMr. Kumar asserted that the state government has already clarified that the benefit of 35% reservation for women in recruitment will be given only to women domiciles in Bihar.\nThe Bihar Cabinet on July 8, 2025 made domicile mandatory for accessing the 35% reservation for women in State government jobs. Previously, women from outside Bihar could also benefit from the reservation policy, which was introduced by the State government in 2016.\nMr. Kumar posted a message on social media platform ‘X’ saying, “I have instructed the Education Department to immediately count the vacancies for teachers in government schools and take action to conduct the TRE 4 examination for appointments as soon as possible.”\nहमने शिक्षा विभाग को कहा है कि सरकारी विद्यालयों में शिक्षकों की रिक्तियों की गणना तुरंत कर ली जाए और इस पर नियुक्ति के लिए TRE 4 की परीक्षा शीघ्र लेने की कार्रवाई की जाए। राज्य सरकार ने पहले ही स्पष्ट कर दिया है कि नियुक्तियों में 35 प्रतिशत महिलाओं के लिए आरक्षण का लाभ बिहार की…\nIn January, Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary had announced that more than 80,000 teachers are going to be appointed in the fourth phase of TRE before the assembly election. He had also said that around 20,000 vacant posts were left in TRE-3 and these posts would be included in TRE-4 which means at least 1 lakh posts are vacant.\nKeeping the assembly election in mind, Mr. Kumar has given special attention to the jobs and recruitment. On July 15 itself, the Bihar cabinet gave its nod for creation of new one crore jobs and employment opportunities in the state over the next five years.\nRecently, Mr. Kumar had announced so far, over 10 lakh youth in the state have been provided with government jobs, and approximately 39 lakh people have been given employment.\nOpposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) spokesperson Chitaranjan Gagan termed the announcement of Chief Minister to conduct TRE-4 for teacher recruitment as a mere election slogan.\n“He still asking for vacancies from the education department whereas the government already has the data of vacancies available. More than 3 lakh teacher posts are vacant in Bihar. If the Chief Minister’s intentions are clear for teacher recruitment, then he will have to immediately issue a notification for recruitment with domicile and start the process of recruitment,”Mr. Gagan said.\nHe further said, “The Chief Minister suddenly remembered TRE-4 when half of July has passed and the announcement of Bihar assembly elections is going to be made in the next one and a half months. According to the working style of the NDA government, even if the notification is issued now, it will get stuck in the model code of conduct (MCC).”"

Now we have decided that from August 1, 2025, that is, from the July bill itself, all domestic consumers in the State will not have to pay any money for electricity up to 125 units. This will benefit a total of 1 crore 67 lakh families in the state,” the Bihar CM said on X.\n“We have also decided that in the next three years, with the consent of all these domestic consumers, solar power plants will be installed on their rooftops or at nearby public places to provide benefits,” he added.\nहमलोग शुरू से ही सस्ती दरों पर सभी को बिजली उपलब्ध करा रहे हैं। अब हमने तय कर दिया है कि 1 अगस्त, 2025 से यानी जुलाई माह के बिल से ही राज्य के सभी घरेलू उपभोक्ताओं को 125 यूनिट तक बिजली का कोई पैसा नहीं देना पड़ेगा। इससे राज्य के कुल 1 करोड़ 67 लाख परिवारों को लाभ होगा। हमने यह…\nMr. Kumar further stated that the State government will fully cover the cost of installing solar power systems for extremely poor families, while others will receive suitable financial assistance under the Kutir Jyoti scheme.\nHe stated that the State could have up to 10,000 megawatts of solar energy available within the next three years. “Under the Kutir Jyoti scheme, for extremely poor families, the State government will bear the entire cost of installing solar power plants, and for the rest, the government will provide appropriate support. This means domestic consumers will no longer have to bear any cost for electricity up to 125 units, and at the same time, it is estimated that within the next three years, up to 10,000 megawatts of solar energy will be available in the State,” Mr. Kumar’s post reads.\nThis announcement came as a move to woo voters ahead of the State Assembly elections scheduled for later this year. Continuing with his string of poll sop announcements, a day earlier, Bihar CM Mr. Kumar directed the Education Department to promptly assess vacancies for teachers in government schoolsand initiate the process for conducting the Teacher Recruitment Examination (TRE) 4.\nThe Chief Minister said that the government is committed to filling teaching positions without delay and has asked officials to expedite the recruitment process. He also reiterated the government’s policy on women’s reservation in the recruitment process, stating that the 35% quota for women will apply only to those who are residents of Bihar."

    "content": "It weighs 8.5 kilograms, is minimalistic, and comes in 14 colours. IIT Madras’ latest innovation is YD One, which it claims is India’s lightest active rigid-frame wheelchair. Born out of the joint efforts of TTK Centre for Rehabilitation Research and Device Development and THRYV Mobility, a fully incubated startup within IIT Madras, the device was launched in Chennai on Wednesday (July 17, 2025).\nThe device has a single frame made of aerospace-grade material. It can be fully customised and is available in sizes from 13 inches to 18 inches. So, what is so special about it? “With the monoframe, minimalistic design, you slap 120 kg on it and make it run through two lakh cycles of double drum test, and then drop it for 6,666 times for drop test; the device cannot even have a small crack or scratch. That is precision engineering and innovative geometry,” Justin Jesudas, founder and CEO, THRYV Mobility, asserts.\nMost wheelchairs in the market were heavy and hospital grade, which were unfit for community use, he said. “This was the reason why you find this population largely invisible, despite being high in numbers. We wanted to change this narrative,” said Mr. Justin, who is himself a wheelchair user for the past 15 years.\nTwenty beneficiaries, many of them para-athletes, were given YD One wheelchairs as part of a CSR initiative of Trimble, a Silicon valley-based industrial technology company. For the beneficiaries, it meant enabling bike travel, easier and longer journeys, greater portability, and manoeuvrability.\nSpeaking about his experience with the struggles of soldiers injured and impaired in the line of duty at the launch, Surgeon Vice Admiral Anupam Kapur, Director General, Hospital Services (Armed Forces), said that freedom and independence meant different things to different people. “Independence is not merely personal, it is social, economic, and technological. It is the freedom of a visually impaired student to navigate a campus independently; it is the ability of a stroke survivor to communicate with his or her loved ones; it is the right of a rural woman to access digital health; and it is the power of a veteran amputee to walk unassisted again if possible. In the armed forces, we see this pursuit of independence not just in theory, we see it happening everyday.”\nV. Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras, said that the device may appear simple but it required deep application of mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, and material sciences to be built. IIT Madras’ innovation push is symbolised by the 400-odd patents the institution filed in the past one year that were heavily deep tech and focused on solving the problems in society, he added.\nRavinder Singh, scientist, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), said that ICMR was instrumental in creating the National Centre for Assistive Health Technology at several institutions, including IIT Madras, enabling research and development in assistive technology. It plans to undertake more initiatives to promote and improve accessibility and affordability of assistive products through health systems in India.\nManish Anand, Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras, who was the project coordinator, said that the device was co-designed with users and with inputs from clinicians as well."

    "content": "A study of 141 cities in India from 2003 to 2020 using satellite-retrieved aerosol data reveals a surprise — aerosol levels were significantly high in 57% of cities compared with the surrounding areas outside the city in south and southeast India, while the converse was true in the case of 43% of cities in northwest and northern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region where the aerosol levels were relatively lower in the cities compared with the surrounding areas.\nResearchers at the School of Earth, Ocean and Climate Sciences, IIT Bhubaneswar, refer to the cities in south and southeast India that show higher aerosol levels than the surrounding areas as Urban Aerosol Pollution Islands. And cities that show relatively lower aerosol levels compared with the surrounding areas are referred to as Urban Aerosol Clean Islands.\nIn the case of cities referred to as urban aerosol clean islands, the aerosol levels were not uniformly higher in the surrounding areas compared with the city. Instead, the levels were higher in the areas southwest of the city, which are located upstream of the dust flow, while the northeast side of the city located downstream of the dust flow showed less aerosol levels which almost matched the levels seen in the city.\n“Aerosol coming from outside wasn’t adding to the pollution already seen in the cities that we refer to as urban aerosol clean islands. Instead, the cities in northwest and in the northern Indo-Gangetic Plain region were stopping or diverting the incoming aerosol and moving it around the city. We observed areas upstream of the aerosol flow had more aerosol load than the city, while the areas northeast of the city that were located downstream of the flow had less aerosol load. It is a trail going actually downwind for some distance,” says Dr. V. Vinoj from IIT Bhubaneswar, and the corresponding author of a paper published on July 16, 2025 in the journalCommunications Earth & Environment. “We didn’t expect this.”\n“North Indian cities, despite being blamed for poor air quality, are found to have no consistent ‘pollution domes’. Instead, we observed urban clean islands —zones with relatively lower aerosol levels than surrounding areas. We hypothesise this unexpected pattern to be linked to a phenomenon known as urban wind stilling effect,” he said.\nWind stilling effect refers to a weakening of surface winds across highly urbanised cities where the buildings and infrastructure reshape local climates, creating zones of atmospheric stagnation. These zones collectively lead to invisible barriers around the city (in the upwind regions), partially blocking the entry of long-range aerosol pollution, especially mineral dust from the nearby arid regions.\nAlso, cities located in regions with high background pollution tend to slow down the transport of pollutants from outside the city, like the dust from Thar desert or aerosol from biomass burning that are transported from elsewhere. This results in cities having relatively less aerosol loading than the surrounding areas.\n“While external sources still contribute to pollution, this barrier alters how pollutants accumulate and disperse, leading to a deceptive pocket of cleaner air within the city and its downwind regions. In contrast, southern Indian cities, with less influence from transported dust and different meteorology, show traditional pollution domes,” Dr. Vinoj explains.\nAccording to Soumya Sethi, a Ph.D. scholar and the first author of the paper, the study makes it clear that the proposed barrier effect seen in cities does not eliminate pollutant transport into the city but only slows down the transport. In the process, the cities in the northwest and northern Indo-Gangetic Plain have relatively less aerosol load while the surrounding areas witness an increase in pollutant build up.\nThe reason why cities in southern India do not have urban aerosol clean islands is because southern cities don’t have any large source of pollutants coming from elsewhere to create a large aerosol background, which will allow us to see this rather invisible dome effect. Instead, we see the urban pollution island because cities are still the dominant source of pollutants, says Dr. Vinoj.\nThe urban clean island effect was not studied during monsoon due to non-availability of data due to clouds and rain. The study looked at data for other seasons but found the urban clean islands effect was pronounced and clearly observable only during the pre-monsoon period. During other seasons, a large amount of dust or other sources of aerosols being transported long distances is not seen, making it difficult to see the urban aerosol clean islands effect clearly.\n“The pre-monsoon time is when the signature is clear, and the urban clean islands effect becomes clearly visible,” he said. The urban clean island effect normally disappears during the post-monsoon but is again seen during winter because of dry conditions but not to the extent that is seen during the pre-monsoon period.\nThe study looked at the high dust case and no dust scenario and found the urban clean island effect became pronounced in many cities in northwest and northern Indo-Gangetic Plain in high dust case but not in the no dust scenario.\n“Our hypothesis is that, irrespective of the season, whenever less transport of aerosol or pollution is happening, you will see urban pollution islands. But whenever the pollution transport from outside is enhanced, you will see a clean island effect,” Dr. Vinoj said.\n“There is an invisible barrier that was not noticed earlier. This barrier is seen only when aerosols from biomass burning or dust are transported from elsewhere.”\nIn fact, a few studies carried out over global megacities such as Shanghai, Atlanta and a few European cities have observed clean islands, but attributed it to emissions in suburban regions.\n“These findings, we feel, challenge conventional understanding that long-range transported aerosols will always lead to more pollution over the cities and underscore the need for deeper scientific understanding into how urban growth and evolving micro-climates influence air pollution and its spatial patterns. Therefore, building truly sustainable, climate-resilient cities will depend on our ability to understand and anticipate these complex interactions as cities continue to expand,” he added."

    "content": "\nDigitally capturing attendance of MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) workersthrough web platform National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS) that depends on photo uploads of the workers is “unworkable” & “counterproductive” and must be withdrawn, Congress general secretary (Communications) Jairam Ramesh said in a statement here.\nThe Hinduhad reported on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) Union Rural Development Ministry’s July 8th directions to the States flagging the various ways NMMS,which was aimed at bringing in transparency, was being manipulated. Three years back the government had made it mandatory for all MNREGA workers to use this platform for marking their attendance. It required them to upload their photographs twice a day at the worksite. It was found that to meet this requirement, irrelevant photographs were being uploaded among other discrepancies.\n“FAST is the self-declared motto of the Modi Government. It actually stands for First Announce Second Think,” Mr. Ramesh said in a statement here taking a dig at the government. Since its introduction, Mr. Ramesh said the Congress has highlighted the operational problems with NMMS and the government’s July 8 notification is a final “acknowledgement” of the problem.\nThe NMMS, Mr. Ramesh said, ended up excluding many genuine workers because of internet connectivity and other reasons without effectively checking the fake workers since they can go twice a day to be photographed, get paid without working for a minute.  “However, the Modi Government, post its acknowledgment of the issue, has identified solutions that are worse than the problem,” he said. Engaging the administration from top to bottom to verify the photos is going to waste the precious time of MNREGA functionaries. He demanded that the government must affirm “task-based payments” which is the essence of MNREGA.\nNikhil Dey, founder member of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, said, that the July 8th order is a confession that NMMS doesn’t work but the solution offered is misplaced and misdirected. “The government is paying the MNREGA labourer for the work carried out not simply for showing up. A photo, even if clicked twice a day doesn’t show whether any work was carried out,” Mr. Dey said.\nInstead of imposing newer and more complicated measures on the workers, Mr. Dey argued that the government must hold the supervisory authorities and the engineers accountable. “A worker is paid on the basis of measurements by the engineers, first in carving out the work and then in appraising how much of it has been done. Instead of tasking the entire administration to look at photographs, shouldn’t the government come up with monitoring mechanisms for supervisory authorities and engineers. Let them need to produce geo-tagged and geo-fenced photographs of the times they go to the field,” Mr. Dey said."

Aboobacker Musliarthrough his close friend and respected Yemeni Sufi scholar Sheikh Habib Omar bin Hafiz has had positive results, with the Yemeni authorities postponing the July 16 execution of Nimisha Priya.\nMr. Musliar said talks had been under way with Talal’s family to persuade them to pardon Nimisha Priya, despite their strong desire for retribution.\nHowever, social media posts purportedly by Talal’s brother Abdul Fatah Mahdi indicated the family’s resolute stance on retribution as per the Islamic law rather than refusing to accept the blood money and pardon Nimisha Priya.\nMr. Fatah Mahdi said “justice would prevail” and affirmed that “retribution would come regardless of any delays in the execution.”\nIn a separate post, he said the family would not grant pardon to Nimisha Priya “in spite of interventions by anybody.”\nMr. Fatah Mahdi ended his post saying “the pens have been lifted, and the papers have been dried”, an Arabic idiom meaning the matter has been settled forever. This phrase is interpreted as the family’s resolution to ensure retribution.\nAccording to sources in Yemen, the family insists on “implementing God’s law in Quisas,” which means retribution in kind as per the Islamic law, instead of pardoning and accepting the blood money called ‘diya’.\nMeanwhile, certain people opposing Mr. Musliar on ideological, organisational and political grounds have further complicated the situation.\nThey have been fuelling the controversy by posting negative comments on social media, specifically targeting Talal’s family members. These online comments have likely exacerbated tensions, contributing to the complexity of the issue.\nThey launched personal attacks on Mr. Musliar while persuading Talal’s family to reject Nimisha Priya’s pardon. In their comments, they argued that accepting blood money would “tarnish the family’s reputation and dishonour Talal’s memory.”"

    "content": "The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has introduced an annual pass that will allow those using private vehicles to take 200 trips a year on national highways and expressways. By paying ₹3,000, one can make trips for one year or make 200 trips (whichever comes first) without the need to recharge.\nVirender Sambyal, Regional Officer, NHAI, Chennai, said that it would be applicable only to private cars, jeeps, and vans. “At toll plazas on expressways, State Highways managed by State governments or local bodies, and parking lots and malls, the regular Fastag will continue to operate,” he said.\n“The annual pass, which will come into force on August 15, can be activated only through the Rajmargyatra mobile app or on the NHAI website. It will be activated on the existing Fastag ID,” he said. Each time a vehicle crosses a toll plaza, it will be counted as one trip. For example, if a person takes a private vehicle from Chennai to Tiruchi, it will be counted as seven trips, as there are seven toll plazas on that stretch. A round trip would be counted as 14 trips.\nUnder Fastag, a return trip to Tiruchi would cost ₹990 and 10 return trips would cost ₹9,900. With this annual pass, it would only take 140 trips and a potential saving of up to ₹6,900. Once the 200 trips are over, the users can recharge."

Chandrababu Naidu, Irrigation Ministers, and officials of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the presence of the Union Minister. “Yet, Harish Rao continues to peddle lies to mislead Telangana’s people,” he said.\nMoreover, theChief Minister, Mr. Reddy, himself explained the discussions in detail at the press meetthat followed the talks in Delhi. “It seems those facts did not register in Mr. Harish Rao’s mind,” he said. He alleged that Mr. Rao’s only interest is in making noise for publicity without regard for facts.\nThe TPCC president reminded that Chief Minister Revanth Reddy had already challenged former Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) and BRS leaders to come to Telangana Assembly for an open debate on water disputes and other issues concerning the State. “The Chief Minister also offered to come to the farm house of KCR if he is not interested in joining the debate in the Assembly. But there is no response,” he said.\nMr. Goud recalled the statements of KCR when he was the Chief Minister — who said there were no river basins or boundaries, and Andhra Pradesh can utilise the floodwaters in Godavari that were to the tune of 3,000 TMC every year.\n“With that assurance, Andhra Pradesh went ahead with the Rayalaseema lift irrigation project when BRS was in power, and the present AP government planned the Banakacherla project. You both have mortgaged Telangana’s interests, and yet you blame Congress, Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, and Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy,” he said."

Is anyone anywhere safe in Bihar? Did it happen before 2005?”."

    "content": "When the AirAsia aircraft emblazoned with superstar Rajinikanth’s face took flight as part of the ‘Kabali’ movie promotion back in 2016, it wasn’t crafted in a film studio but painted by hand at Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The same team gave FlyBeond’s aircraft its sleek metallic look, layering copper-toned paint infused with gold-dust mica — a livery that shimmered like no other.\nTucked away in a hangar on the edge of the airport, GMR Aero Technic is doing more than just routine maintenance. It’s redefining what aircraft transformation looks like, one flawless coat at a time.\n“Aircraft painting is not like painting cars or hoardings; here there is no room for error,” says Mohammed Sadiq (name changed), a painter at the facility. “Every coat, from the base to the clear finish, must be applied with precision because it affects the aircraft’s aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. We were trained in everything, from handling paint guns and surface prep to how to safely move on top of the aircraft. It is a critical job that requires both skill and focus,” he adds.\nNine aircraft, in various states of transformation, sit beneath high bay lights, some stripped to their bare metal, and others mid-way through a makeover. This is not just mechanical upkeep, this is where global airlines send their jets to be reimagined structurally, visually and functionally. It is a facility that has turned Hyderabad into a serious contender on the global aviation map.\n“This highly regulated process blends aerodynamics, weight optimisation and visual branding. Every coat matters. Too thick and it adds weight; too rough and it impacts drag. Both affect fuel efficiency and emissions,” explains Ashok Gopinath, president and accountable manager of GMR Aero Technic.\nEach livery painting takes between seven and 11 days, with over half that time spent on surface preparation. GMR employs around 30 skilled professionals per aircraft paint job, each trained not just in technical standards but in visual artistry. Many come from commercial painting backgrounds, automobiles, hoardings and even signages, and are put through a 6-8 month customised aviation painting programme, including training from global paint manufacturers like PPG, Mankiewicz and AkzoNobel.\nThe paint shop at RGIA where aircraft components receive fresh coats.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SIDDHANT THAKUR\nPainting is typically done between midnight and 6 a.m., when ambient temperatures are optimal and the facility is quieter. Hyderabad’s moderate weather gives it an edge over cities like Delhi, where extreme summer or winter temperatures can delay paint cycles. A full repaint typically costs around $200,000 to $250,000, depending on the complexity, materials and branding requirements. “Each aircraft that leaves early because we save a day on painting saves the airline about $30,000. Our hangar is fully booked till mid-2026,” Mr Gpoinath adds.\nUnlike stickers or placards that can peel off mid-air, GMR hand-paints intricate liveries, including the now-iconic Air India Express tails, each representing a different Indian art form. “Each tail is unique. The challenge is to maintain consistency in quality and colour across a 100-foot aircraft surface, often under tight timelines,” he explains.\n“Most of our work happens at night when temperatures are stable. We wear full safety gear and make sure all tools are grounded, even static electricity can be dangerous in this job. Painting a plane is a team effort. The aircraft is divided section by section and each painter knows their part, whether it is the tail, body or wings. We take a few steps back, check every curve and joint carefully, and make sure the finish is perfect before we move on,” says Ajit Kumar (name changed), another painter on the team.\nFounded in 2011, GMR Aero Technic began by focusing on airframe maintenance, the largest and most infrastructure-heavy vertical within the MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) ecosystem. Today, it is India’s largest independent MRO and a full-service provider offering everything from end-of-lease checks and C-checks to cabin upgrades and aircraft modifications.\nWith 9+1 operational lines, the facility can handle up to 10 aircraft simultaneously. Roughly 70% of its business comes from international clients, including Kuwait’s Jazeera Airways, FlyDubai and Southeast Asian carriers. Domestic clients include IndiGo, Air India Express and SpiceJet.\nA Jazeera Airways Airbus A320-200 aircraft sits in one of the nine hangars at GMR Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility at Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SIDDHANT THAKUR\nWhat gives GMR an edge is its extensive regulatory clearances, not just from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), but also from global aviation authorities like the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the US Federal Aviation Administration, and over 30 other countries. This level of accreditation places it in competition with the likes of Turkish Technic (Istanbul), ST Engineering (Singapore) and Joramco (Jordan).\nGMR’s ambition is not just limited to airframe work or paint. It envisions Hyderabad as South Asia’s one-stop MRO ecosystem, akin to Singapore’s world-class aerospace hub.\nTo this end, the company has tied up with global players like Spirit AeroSystems (for engine nacelle repairs), Safran (for DSL booths) and Liebherr (for heat exchangers). It has also launched an aviation academy offering DGCA and EASA-approved training programmes, grooming the next generation of MRO professionals.\nThe next major leap is already on the drawing board: by 2027, GMR plans to add a wide-body aircraft paint hangar, which will allow it to handle long-haul jets like the Boeing 777 aircraft that Indian airlines like Air India currently send abroad, often to the US, for painting. “That work will be done here in Hyderabad,” says Mr.Gopinath.\nAs the aviation world grows, the demand for precision maintenance and visual branding is skyrocketing. The next time a plane takes to the skies gleaming with a new coat, chances are that the shimmer was born in a quiet hangar in Hyderabad."

He said he had also rushed General Education officers in Kollam district to the spot.\nMr. Sivankutty termed the incident “extremely distressing.” He said the government would examine whether there was any indifference on the school management’s part, which caused the tragic death.\nMeanwhile, local people told reporters on the spot that the power line was hanging loosely and almost touched the lean-to.\nThey accused the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) of not realigning the power line, which passed dangerously close to the school building.\nElectricity Minister K. Krishnankutty told reporters that he had ordered an inquiry into the incident, and it was too early in the day to state whether there was any safety lapse on KSEB’s part.\n“The government hopes to get the inquiry report in a matter of hours.

Joseph Vijay in a civil suit filed against him for having used a “deceptively” similar colour combinationin his party flagas that of Thondai Mandala Saandror Dharma Paribalana Sabai, a registered trust based in Mylapore, Chennai.\nJustice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy called for the response of the actor-turned-politician within two weeks after the plaintiff’s counsel Ramesh Ganapathy contended the trust had registered its emblem as a trademark by making an application in November 2023. He said, the mark was registered and a certificate was issued to the trust on June 1, 2024.\nHowever, in August 2024, the plaintiff trust was shocked to come across the TVK’s flag being “deceptively” similar to its registered trademark. It claimed to have issued a legal notice to Mr. Vijay on May 13, 2025, and received a response on May 31, 2025, stating the TVK was not involved in business or commercial activities and hence, a trademark dispute would not arise.\n“The defendants do not even understand that the trademark and copyright protections are available to service providers as well,” the plaintiff trust, represented by its trustee G.B. Pachaiyappan, said. He contended both the trust as well as the TVK were involved in social service and therefore, the use of “deceptively” similar identification marks would cause confusion in the minds of the people.\nThe plaintiff trust also stated it had been using its trademark on its promotional materials and that it runs a Tamil monthly magazine titledSaandror Kuralwith the mark. Further, the trust claimed to have a strong social media presence by running a YouTube channel too, which had gathered a considerable amount of goodwill and reputation for the trademark.\nThe trust urged the court to grant a permanent injunction restraining the TVK from using the latter’s current flag and also sought a similar interim injunction. Stating that the larger question as to whether this dispute would fall under the trademark dispute would have to be examined in detail, the judge said, that issue could be gone into only after the defendants file their response."

Of these, 11 colleges were established in 2022 while the two-year-old Kalaignar Centenary Super Speciality Hospital (KCSSH) will see an increase in its existing PG seats.\nAccording to an official order, the State has granted permission to start new PG courses in the 13 government medical colleges and to increase the seats in the existing PG programmes  at KCSSH. The Essentiality Certificate has been issued and permission granted to the Director of Medical Education and Research to apply for approval from National Medical Commission (NMC).\nA total of 460 new PG seats have been proposed at the government medical colleges in Pudukottai, Karur, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur, Tiruvallur, Namakkal, Virudhunagar, Nilgiris, Kallakurichi, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Ariyalur and Krishnagiri. Except Pudukottai and Karur, the rest are among the 11 new medical colleges added in 2022.\nKCSSH, which is attached to the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, currently offers 38 PG seats. The State government has now proposed 28 additional seats across seven specialties of Nephrology, Urology, Medical Gastroenterology, Surgical Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Aneasthesiology and Radiology.\nThe courses proposed in the 13 medical colleges include MD in General Medicine, Paediatrics, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Radio diagnosis, Anaesthesiology.\nHowever, some government doctors have pointed out that institutions such as the Government Omandurar Medical College and Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate have not been included. “The increase in seats could have been better distributed. Many of us expected an increase in seats in a number of specialties here according to the patient load, but have been left out.” said a doctor who did not wish to be named.\nA. Ramalingam, general secretary of Service Doctors and Postgraduates Association, said by increasing the PG seats, the State government is gradually phasing out  junior and senior resident posts, who according to NMC norms should be engaged in patient care. “Instead of having the posts of junior and senior residents, the State government is misusing PGs as manpower to address the prevailing shortage of doctors. This should not be the case,” he said."

    "content": "Two senior leaders of the outlawed CPI (Maoist), including the founding member of the party’s cultural wing and a contemporary of revolutionary balladeer Gaddar, surrendered before the Rachakonda Police Commissioner on Thursday (July 17, 2025), marking a significant move away  from decades of insurgent activity in Telangana and Chhattisgarh.\nThe couple, identified as Mala Sanjeev alias Lengu Dada and Perugula Parvathi alias Bontala Parvathi or Deena, held key positions in the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC). Sanjeev, now 62, is originally from Yapral in Medchal–Malkajgiri district and served as a State Committee member and Secretariat member of Chaitanya Natya Manch (CNM), the cultural arm of the CPI (Maoist). His wife Parvathi, aged 50, from Vankeshwaram village in Nagarkurnool, held the rank of State Committee member and was part of CNM’s Cultural Sub-Committee.\nThe police said that their surrender was influenced by the Telangana government’s rehabilitation policies and welfare schemes aimed at reintegrating former Maoists into civilian life. The couple expressed their desire to live peacefully with their families and give up the armed movement they were part of for over four decades.\nRachakonda Police Commissioner, G. Sudheer Babu, described the surrender as “a moral victory” for Telangana Police’s sustained and inclusive approach towards counterinsurgency. “Their decision reflects the growing confidence in our rehabilitation policy and the realisation that violence has no place in today’s democratic society,” he said.\nSanjeev’s involvement with the Maoist movement began in 1980 through the Jana Natya Mandali (JNM), the cultural wing of the CPI (ML) People’s War, led by Gummadi Vittal, also known as Gaddar. Between 1980 and 1986, Sanjeev played a crucial role in spreading the party’s ideology through performances across 16 States alongside cultural figures like Dappu Ramesh and Divakar.\nHe later joined the armed wing, working in multiple dalams across Telangana and was eventually promoted as State Committee Member in 2001. After being transferred to Chhattisgarh in 2003, he became the in-charge of CNM under DKSZC, where he remained active until his surrender.\nParvathi entered the Maoist ranks in 1992 and worked in several dalams in the Nallamala region and Visakhapatnam district before being posted to DKSZC in 2007. That same year, she married Sanjeev and continued to perform, compose and train Maoist cadres in Hindi, Telugu, and Koya languages. She was elevated to State Committee Member status in 2018.\nBoth had previously survived exchanges of fire with security forces, Sanjeev in 2002 and 2005, and Parvathi in 2017.\nRachakonda Police urged other underground Maoists from Telangana to follow suit and return to their native villages. “We appeal to all those still underground to return and take part in rebuilding their communities. The door to peace and dignity is open,” said the Police Commissioner.\nThe Police also warned of legal action against individuals operating under the guise of mass organisations with the intent to disrupt law and order. Citing a decline in Maoist recruitment and a shift in youth attitudes, authorities described Maoism as an outdated and failed ideology that has lost relevance in contemporary society.\n“Lay down arms and leave the underground. Join the mainstream of public life,” the Commissioner said.\nREC to Red Corridor: Nambala Keshava Rao, Cherukuri Rajkumar among top Maoists traced back to now NITW\nMaoist couple with ₹25 lakh bounty surrenders before police in Ramagundam of Telangana’s Peddapalli district\nOperation Cheyutha: 12 more Maoist cadres and militia members from Chhattisgarh surrender before police in Telangana\nMaoists now confined to a very small area, says Chhattisgarh CM Sai"

Balagopal has said.\nThe amount has been sanctioned to Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), which is in charge of the procurement. The ₹100 crore is meant for the subsidy for the paddy procurement in March and April this year (2025).\nThe government had sanctioned ₹185 crore earlier this year for paddy procurement up to February. The State Budget for the 2025-26 fiscal has earmarked ₹606 crore for the purpose.\nMr. Balagopal said the State government is ensuring prompt payment of subsidy even though the Centre has run up arrears on the minimum support price (MSP).\nAccording to him, the Centre’s arrears on support price and transportation charges have mounted to nearly ₹1,100 crore. Kerala follows a model where the farmers are promptly paid through the paddy receipt sheet (PRS) scheme, without waiting for the Centre to release the support price, he added."

    "content": "The CBI has succeeded in facilitating the return of 134 fugitives from abroad in the last five years -- nearly twice the number of repatriated persons over an entire decade between 2010 and 2019, officials said.\nCoordinating closely with Interpol as well as state and central enforcement agencies, the CBI was able to secure the extradition or deportation of these 134 fugitives since 2020. Of these, 23 were brought back this year alone.\nIn contrast, only 74 fugitives were brought back during the decade between 2010 and 2019.\nThe uptick in the success rate can easily be attributed to enhanced diplomatic engagements by the government, India's outreach through VVIP visits, bilateral ties, technological advancements, and improved coordination with Interpol, the officials said.\nThe process of extradition has three stages: issuance of a Red Notice by Interpol, geolocation of the fugitive, and third, extradition after legal and diplomatic manoeuvres, all of which are time-consuming processes.\nTo reduce the time required to issue a Red Notice by Interpol, which alerts all 195 countries about a fugitive wanted in a country, the CBI launched its digital portal Bharatpol in January.\nThe platform, developed in-house by the agency, connects Indian police agencies with Interpol through the CBI, significantly accelerating the investigative and repatriation processes, thereby reducing the average time to publication of a Red Notice from six months to three months.\nAlso read:The Hindu Explains: The Interpol and its functions\n\"The portal has ensured improved documentation, which took time because at times officials dealing with Interpol issues were not well versed with the format in which the application for repatriation of fugitives is to be submitted to Interpol through the CBI. The to-and-fro communication between CBI and other agencies has now been significantly curtailed, resulting in a substantial reduction in time wasted,\" an officer said.\nAdditionally, a crucial factor in ensuring extradition and deportation is a government-to-government understanding, which has seen a significant increase in recent years due to enhanced diplomatic activity by India.\nThe role of the External Affairs Ministry, especially that of the ambassadors and high commissioners, is a crucial factor in the repatriation of fugitives.\nThe CBI, which serves as India's National Central Bureau and the country's designated liaison agency with Interpol, has also enhanced its international coordination through the establishment of the Global Operations Centre.\nThis centre plays a crucial role by engaging foreign law enforcement agencies to expedite India’s extradition efforts and vice versa, officials said.\nA recent notable success of this coordinated effort was the arrest of Nehal Modi in the U.S. Nehal is the brother of Nirav Modi, who is currently incarcerated in the U.K., awaiting extradition to India. Nirav Modi, along with his uncle Mehul Choksi, allegedly orchestrated ₹13,000 crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank through fraudulent Letters of Undertaking.\nNehal Modi, previously imprisoned at Franklin Correctional Institute in New York following a separate conviction there, was slated for release on July 4. Acting pre-emptively, the CBI contacted the U.S. authorities nearly a month in advance, resulting in Nehal's arrest upon his release. He is now facing extradition proceedings, which begin on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nMeanwhile, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi remain in custody in London and Antwerp, respectively, with multiple bail applications denied by the courts there. The CBI continues to pursue their extradition through the appropriate legal channels.\nLast week, the CBI successfully extradited an economic offender from the U.S. who had fled there in 1999. After a lengthy legal battle, India secured the extradition of Monika Kapoor on July 9.\nSuch progress is reciprocal, officials said, India has also facilitated the return of fugitives wanted by foreign governments.\nIn March, Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov, wanted by the U.S. authorities of laundering millions through his platform \"Grantax\" was arrested in Kerala. Besciokov, who was preparing to flee the country, was captured in a joint operation by the CBI and Kerala Police.\nThe CBI has also launched the prosecution of a number of fugitives who have escaped to India from Gulf countries.\nIn addition, the crackdown on cybercriminals, based on complaints received from foreign countries, especially the U.S., Germany, and Japan, has led the CBI to bust a number of such gangs that were cheating citizens in those countries.\nThe countrywide searches have resulted in the seizure of ₹30-40 crore worth of cryptocurrency from these syndicates. Such actions have also been beneficial to India, with extradition requests from here gaining increased importance in those jurisdictions.\nAccording to government data, 65 Indian extradition requests remain under consideration by the U.S. as of December 2024.\nThe Gulf region, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has emerged as a key partner in India's repatriation efforts. A significant increase has been observed in recent years, largely due to high-level diplomatic engagements.\nSeveral alleged criminals have been brought back from the UAE in 2025, including narcotics manufacturer Kubbawala Mustafa and drug trafficker Taher Salim Dolais wanted by Mumbai Police, fraudster Upavan Pavan Jain wanted by Gujarat Police, counterfeit currency trafficker Moideenabba Ummer Beary wanted by the National Investigation Agency, and Suhail Basheer wanted by Kerala Police.\nSome jurisdictions remain difficult to expedite extradition proceedings due to their domestic legal constraints, the officials said.\nHowever, persistent diplomatic outreach has led to the apprehension of several high-priority fugitives, they said, without naming specific countries.\nIndia has so far signed extradition treaties with 48 countries and formalised extradition arrangements with 12 others, according to recent government data provided in Parliament.\nThe 2022 Interpol General Assembly, held in India, and the G20 Summit hosted here have also acted as a catalyst in the progress.\nDuring the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a forceful appeal to address delays in the extradition of fugitives.\n\"There can be no safe havens for the corrupt, terrorists, drug cartels, poaching gangs or organised crime. Such crimes against people in one place are crimes against everyone, crimes against humanity,\" he had said.\nHome Minister Amit Shah had similarly advocated for the establishment of a permanent Interpol mechanism for the exchange of real-time information between counterterrorism agencies of all member states."

Kamaraj wouldn’t sleep without an air conditioner and that he held the hands of  DMK patriarch  M. Karunanidhi in his (Kamaraj’s) final days and urged him to ‘protect democracy’ have caused some unease within the DMK-Congress alliance. TNCC president K. Selvaperunthagai and party Karur MP S. Jothimani have criticised Mr. Siva for his remarks.\nMr. Selvaperunthagai said nobody had the right to question or speak in such a manner about  Kamaraj. “He (Siva) is speaking without any evidence. Leave him. Nobody is qualified to criticise Kamarajar,” he said.\nMs. Jothimani said Kamaraj was not only known for his honesty and administrative skills, but also for his simplicity, and added that he was defeated in elections because of  myths spread by the DMK.\n“He travelled to every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu. . These nooks and corners  do not have air conditioned rooms or five-star hotels. As a Chief Minister, Kamaraj stayed in the government hostels and even slept under a tree when the heat was too much,”  she said. Mr Siva’s statements were “completely untrue.”\n“Kamaraj’s soul will not forgive us if we do not give a proper response to the myths spread against him. Every Congress worker should remember that the party is still standing in the political field in Tamil Nadu because of him.”\nReacting to Mr Siva’s comments, TMC (Moopanar) leader G.K. Vasan said the party was pained over this and strongly condemned them. “Kamaraj is instrumental for the growth attained by Tamil Nadu today. His tenure was known as the golden rule. He was a role model known for his simplicity and integrity. Therefore, such wrong statements (by Mr. Siva) should not have been made,” Mr. Vasan said.\nLater in the day, Mr. Siva requested that his remarks on Kamaraj not be turned into a debate, adding that he held the late leader in high regard.\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Tiruchi Velusamy’s comments at a public rally in Manaparai that only a coalition government is feasible in Tamil Nadu after the 2026 Assembly election raised some eyebrows. “We are not saints. Our intention is to attain power in Tamil Nadu. If my prediction is right, the next government can only be a coalition government and two Congressmen will be ministers. First let us become ministers in Tamil Nadu and then capture power in the State,” he said.\nReacting to it, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said, “This may be his view. But, anything related to seat sharing or sharing of power will be decided by the Congress leadership.”"

    "content": "The status report on the stampede at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru that left 11 people dead has blamed the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), their event management partner DNA Networks Private Limited, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) for unilaterally organising RCB’s massive victory parade and celebration without prior permission, or furnishing mandatory details to city authorities.\nThe report has been submitted to the High Court, government sources said.\nAccording to the report, at about 6.30 pm, just hours before the IPL final between RCB and Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Ahmedabad, the KSCA on behalf of DNA Networks Pvt Ltd submitted a letter of intimation to the Cubbon Park police station.\n“Should RCB emerge victorious in the tournament, the management of RCB/DNA Entertainment Networks Private Limited intends to plan potential victory parades around the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, culminating in victory celebrations at the stadium. This was in the nature of an intimation, not a requisition for permission as required under the law,” the report said.\nHowever, the police denied permission due to the lack of critical information, including projected crowd size, event logistics, and crowd control measures. The proposal was also made on short notice, which precluded due processing.\nDespite this, RCB unilaterally proceeded on June 4, announcing a public ‘Victory Parade’ from Vidhana Soudha to Chinnaswamy Stadium via multiple social media posts starting at 7.01 am.\nA final post at 3.14 pm announced that the parade would begin at 5.00 pm and would be followed by stadium celebrations.\nThis post was the first to mention that free passes were available online, but it came after large crowds had already started gathering.\nThe posts garnered widespread attention, with the first four updates accumulating viewership figures of 16 lakh, 4.26 lakh, 7.6 lakh, and 17 lakh respectively.\nThis crowd estimate is supported by BMRCL ridership on June 4, which saw 9.66 lakh commuters compared to a daily average of six lakh.\n“Therefore, including those who travelled on foot, used public transport, and private means on June 4, the estimated gathering would be well beyond three lakh individuals,” the statement said.\nThe report emphasised that the organisers never formally sought police permission in the prescribed format as mandated by the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bangalore City) Order, 2009.\nIt clarified that merely submitting an intimation does not amount to seeking permission, particularly for events involving large public gatherings in central Bengaluru.\nAuthorities claimed that the essential details such as the number of participants, assembly point, timing, names and contact details of responsible organisers, and plans for traffic and crowd control, were entirely missing.\nThis lack of information prevented police from assessing the event’s scale or planning adequate safety measures.\nFurthermore, there was no signage or loudspeakers for public instructions, no trained staff for crowd management at entry gates and within seating areas, and no prior request for loudspeaker use or police bandobast.\nThe organisers also failed to pay for police deployment, as mandated by the Government Order dated May 22, 2019, the report said.\nDespite the absence of coordination or approvals, the Bengaluru City Police implemented multiple measures to manage the situation on the ground.\nA meeting was convened at 10 am on June 4 at the office of the Joint Commissioner of Police, where traffic and law enforcement planning was finalised.\nA total of 654 traffic personnel were deployed, including 4 DCPs, 6 ACPs, 23 PIs, 57 PSIs, 104 ASIs, and 462 constables.\nThe route taken by the RCB team, from HAL to Taj West End, Vidhana Soudha, and finally Chinnaswamy Stadium, was regulated to minimise disruption.\nA traffic advisory and map were released through press, social media, and FM radio, advising the public to avoid central areas and use Metro or other public transport due to limited parking. Nine diversion points were created and 125 barricades installed with an additional 11 barricading zones added as a precaution. Local schools were requested to close by noon.\nBMTC deployed its Sarathi teams, and the E-Path app was activated for ambulance management. A dedicated control room monitored traffic movements throughout the event.\nEight major sectors were identified where police personnel were stationed to regulate and manage the public.\nThe report concluded that RCB, DNA Networks, and KSCA ignored standard procedures and safety measures, leading to violations and potential public safety risks.\nTheir failure to obtain permission and coordinate with authorities ahead of time left the city administration with no option but to respond reactively to an event that had already gained momentum through social media mobilisation.\n“Recognising the need for accountability within the law enforcement hierarchy, the government took action against police officials on June 5, 2025.\nA Government Order suspended five police officers, including three IPS officers of significant rank: the Commissioner of Police, the Inspector General and Additional Commissioner of Police, and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, alongside the Assistant Commissioner of Police for Cubbon Park and the Police Inspector of Cubbon Park,” the report said."

I also had a three-hour meeting with sports lawyers to understand their perspective,\" Mr. Mandaviya stated in his address.\n\"The IOC was consulted as well along with international sports federations. FIFA had a query and I sent an officer to their headquarters to discuss things with them. The National Sports Bill is now read and will be in Parliament during Monsoon session,\" he added but did not go into the specifics.\nThe Bill seeks to make the country's sports administrators more accountable with the provision of a regulatory board which would have the power to grant recognition and decide funding to NSFs based on their adherence to provisions related to good governance.\nThe board will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with the highest governance, financial, and ethical standards. In addition, the Bill proposes the establishment of Ethics Commissions and Dispute Resolution Commissions to ensure transparency in governance.\nIt has been opposed by the IOA, which feels that a regulatory board would undermine its standing as the nodal body for all NSFs.\n\"I spoke to Ajay Maken (senior Congress leader) too. He made a good effort to have this Bill passed,\" said Mr. Mandaviya, referring to Mr. Maken's aggressive push for cleaner sports governance during his eventful tenure that lasted a little over one year.\nGovernance reforms, which focus around timely elections, have been a thorny issue with prominent NSFs such as the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) being accused of dragging their feet on polls that have been long due.\nThe Minister avoided taking names but urged the administrators to rise above their personal interests. \"Main nahi hum(We, not I), that should be the way forward. We have to introspect whether it's enough to just grab the chair. We have to let go of ego. Give the seat to someone better if you see one,\" he said. \"Reforms is a step by step process,\" he asserted."

He said this included procuring fitness certificates from the Fire, Electricity, Motor Vehicles, Health, Local Self-Government and Public Works departments.\n“It is incumbent on school managements to ensure that they follow the government’s direction. There are 14,000 schools in the State. General Education department officials presumably can’t go and inspect every institution individually. School managements should ensure compliance with rules,” he said.\nMoreover, Mr. Sivankutty stated that the rules mandated that no overhead line could pass over a school building or be located proximate to the institution. “It is the bounden duty of school management to adhere to the government checklist strictly. However, the Thevalakkara government-aided school management appeared to have given student safety a back seat. The government viewed the matter with utmost gravity. It has requested reports from various agencies,” Mr. Sivankutty said.\nHe also implied that the school management had failed to mind the children. “How did it escape the teachers, principal and head master that children climbed onto the awning to retrieve articles without them noticing the risky behaviour?” Mr. Sivankutty asked.\nMr. Sivankutty said he has apprised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of the tragic accident. “The Chief Minister has asked me to go to the spot. The government stands with Midhun’s bereaved family. The administration’s focus is on preventing such accidents in the future by identifying hazards”, Mr. Sivankutty added.\nMeanwhile, the incident has caused a public outcry and raised questions about student safety. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers protested in front of the school, blaming the government and the aided management for the student’s death.\nN.K. Premachandran, Kollam MP, demanded a thorough investigation into the incident. He said the KSEB failed to realign the power line, which dangled perilously over the school building. He said the public utility could have prevented the mishap had it drawn an insulated power line, instead of the regular one.\nKovoor Kunjumon, a Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislator from the Kunnathoor constituency in Kollam district and leader of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP-Leninist), blamed the KSEB and the school management for the incident.\nHe demanded that the KSEB state which electrical safety criterion it had applied to grant a fitness certificate to the school management before the commencement of classes for the current academic year.\nMeanwhile, Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has taken a suo motu case concerning the student’s death."

Ramadoss said on Thursday (July 17, 2025) that a probe has been initiated into the allegedplanting of a bugging device beneath his chairat his Thailapuram residence.\nSpeaking to reporters, Mr. Ramadoss said a police investigation was under way to determine who had placed the device. All details would come to light in the next two to three days, he added.\nHe said the State is expected to receive higher rainfall this year compared to previous years. With the shutters of several dams in Tamil Nadu remaining in a dilapidated condition due to poor maintenance, such heavy rainfall could lead to a perilous situation. The government should immediately take up the repair of shutters and other mechanical systems to regulate water across all dams ahead of the northeast monsoon. The State government should also release ₹1,000 crore without delay to carry out the repair works, he added.\nWhile welcoming the ‘Ungaludan Stalin’ (Stalin with you) initiative, Mr. Ramadoss said the scheme should have been launched six months earlier. He also referred to a claim that a grievance raised by a woman was resolved within four hours. “This is not a matter of pride; it is a matter of degradation in the administration,” he said.\nMr. Ramadoss further said the judiciary continued to express its displeasure with the style of functioning of the State police. It is really a matter of concern that even after practicing yoga and meditation, the police are indulging in certain behaviours. This only shows that some of these police personnel are not fit to be in their posts."

Boeing declined to comment.\nApreliminary report into the crashreleased by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said the fuel switches had switched from run to cutoff a second apart just after takeoff, but it did not say how they were flipped.\nAlmost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed abackup energy source called a ram air turbinehad deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.\nOne pilot was then heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. \"The other pilot responded that he did not do so,\" the report said.\nWithout fuel flowing to the engines, the London-bound plane began to lose thrust. After reaching a height of 650 feet, the plane began to sink.\nThe fuel switches for both engines were turned back to run, and the airplane automatically tried restarting the engines, the report said.\nAlso Read |Families of 47 victims of Air India 171 crash victims receive interim payout; lawyers warn against forgoing rights for full compensation\nBut the plane was too low and too slow to be able to recover, aviation safety expert John Nance toldReuters.The plane clipped some trees and a chimney before crashing in a fireball into a building on a nearby medical college campus, the report said, killing 19 people on the ground and 241 of the 242 on board the 787.\nIn an internal memo on Monday (July 14, 2025), Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said thepreliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faultsand that all required maintenance had been carried out.\nThe AAIB's preliminary report hadno safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturerGE. After the report was released, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen byReutersshowed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.\nThe circumstantial evidence increasingly indicates that a crew member flipped the engine fuel switches, Mr. Nance said, given there was \"no other rationale explanation\" that was consistent with the information released to date.\nNonetheless, investigators \"still have to dig into all the factors\" and rule out other possible contributing factors which would take time, he said.\nMost air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.\nThe Air India crash has rekindled debate over adding flight deck cameras, known as cockpit image recorders, on airliners. Mr. Nance said investigators likely would have benefited greatly from having video footage of the cockpit during the Air India flight.\nAir India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said this month it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, afterReutersreported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance."

    "content": "The government has filed a petition before the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) to reduce the tariff on LT 4(a) — the irrigation pump set category — and increase the tariff for industrial and commercial consumers to fill the revenue gap of ₹4,620 crore.\nThe revenue gap occurs at the electricity supply company (escom) level when there is a deficit between the tariff collected and the expenditure, including power purchase cost, that is incurred.\nThe commission has admitted the review petition.\nIn this year’s (FY 2025 – 26) budget, the government of Karnataka had announced a subsidy of ₹16,021 crore for IP sets, and ₹10,101 crore for Gruha Jyothi scheme. However, in the tariff order passed for this year, KERC stated that the subsidy required to provide free power for IP sets is ₹20,095.44 crore.\nIn the petition, the government has also stated that in addition to the subsidy amount of ₹16,021 crore announced in the budget, the government will release an additional subsidy of ₹2,362.47 crore to mitigate the overall shortfall in revenue.\nIndustrialists and experts from the power sector argued that KERC should not have admitted the review petition, as it did not have the necessary criteria.\n“A review petition under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) is a mechanism for a court to reconsider its own judgement or order. This is typically done when there is a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, new and important evidence is discovered, or another sufficient reason exists. It is a way to correct errors, and not meant to be a second chance to argue the case on merits,” said M. G. Prabhakar, former advisory member, KERC.\nHowever, KERC officials said that there are grounds to admit the petition and seek public opinion.\n“When the government itself is appealing, we can admit the petition. We have now directed escoms to publish newspaper advertisements and hold public hearings on the matter. We will take a decision based on the recommendations of all stakeholders,” P. Ravikumar, Chairman, KERC toldThe Hindu.\nIndustrialists, who have already been burdened by a plethora of cess, are dreading an increase in tariff, especially since the recent tariff petition is a multi-year tariff petition.\nShiva Kumar R., former president of Peenya Industries Association (PIA), said, “Industries are already in dire straits. Especially in Bengaluru, the infrastructure is still new, and we face a lot of hardship. The government wants us to increase minimum wage. They have already imposed a tariff of 36 paise per unit for this year to cover the pension and gratuity of escom employees. We are also paying solid waste management (SWM) cess. Instead of burdening us so much, if industries are encouraged, then economic activity and employment generation will increase. Otherwise, how are micro and small-scale industries supposed to operate?”\nHe added, “We strongly oppose this petition. We will definitely file our objections when a public hearing is called.”\nFor FY 2025 – 26, the energy charges for industrial consumers are ₹6.60 per unit, and for commercial consumers, it is ₹5.95 per unit. The energy charges for both these categories were reduced in the tariff order while the charges for the LT 4(a) category went up from ₹5.65 per unit to ₹8.30 per unit."

He also asked whether there is a shortage of this fertilizer.\nIn his reply, State Agriculture Minister Ramvichar Netam said that in the kharif crop season 2025, a target of 3,10,000 metric tonnes of DAP has been set by the Centre for the state.\nA supply plan of 2,19,100 MT has been issued by the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers from April to June 2025, against which 1,08,155 MT has been supplied till June 30, he said.\nA total of 1,48,900 MT has been stored, including the savings stock of 40,746 MT, of the previous season (rabi 2024-25), he said.\nThe Minister said that in the current kharif season, a shortage in the supply of DAP is being reflected against the supply plan issued till June 30.\nKeeping this in view, alternative phosphatic fertilizers are being stored for farmers and it is being promoted for use among them, he added.\nMr. Patel further claimed that so far, not up to 50% of the total demand has been supplied, and asked about the quantities given to the cooperative societies and to the private sector.\nThe Minister said, the departments concerned are in constant coordination with the central government to ensure the supply of DAP.\nTill July 20, a total of 18,885 MT of the fertilizer will again be supplied to the state. On Thursday, 718 MT of it will reach Kharsia (the constituency represented by Umesh Patel), he said.\nIt is correct that there is a shortage of DAP in the state and the same condition persists even in the entire country due to global reasons. Keeping the same in view, nano DAP fertilizer is being promoted, he added.\nNetam said, of the total DAP stock, 64% has been given to the cooperative sector and the remaining 36% to the private sector.\nHowever, Congress members claimed that the fertilizer is available in the private sector and shopkeepers have been black marketing it and selling it at high prices taking advantage of the shortage in the cooperative societies.\nDissatisfied with the Minister's reply, the opposition members created an uproar. Amid pandemonium, the House was adjourned for five minutes.\nAfter the business resumed, Congress members again raised the issue. Shouting slogans against the government, they trooped into the well of the House and were automatically suspended.\nSpeaker Raman Singh announced the suspension of 30 Congress MLAs, including Leader of Opposition Charan Das Mahant and former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, and asked them to go outside the House.\nHowever, Congress members remained in the well and continued sloganeering.\nThe total strength of the Congress in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly is 35.\nLater, the Speaker again adjourned the House. After the proceedings resumed, the Speaker expressed displeasure and said even after his repeated requests to go outside the House, the suspended opposition MLAs violated the rules and remained in the well.\nSingh said he was pained by their act and suspended them from the House for the day."

It lists their genealogy as Samanta Vetti, Gunda I, Erra, and Gunda II. It also mentions that Talapa captured and imprisoned the boy king Vijayaditya and ruled the kingdom for one month.\nThe inscription records that King Vikramaditya II, on the occasion of his coronation, granted the village of Kovuṛu, situated in Kanḍeruvaḍi vishaya, to Lokamamba — wife of Gunda II (administrator of Kondapalli vishaya) — who had died while assisting Vikramaditya II in the war against Talapa to regain the throne.\nIt was issued by Vikramaditya II, son of Chalukya Bhima I and Vijayamahadevi, and bears the Chalukya royal seal depicting a boar (Varaha) and the legend Sri Tribhuvanamkusa.

    "content": "Observing that caste-based discrimination cannot be permitted in a country governed by the rule of law, the Madras High Court on Thursday (July 17, 2025) directed the Ariyalur Superintendent of Police to ensure that Scheduled Caste (SC) persons are not prevented from entering the Puthukudi Ayyanar Temple in Udayarpalayam taluk.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh directed the Superintendent of Police and the Udayarpalayam Revenue Divisional Officer to ensure that all classes of people, irrespective of their caste, are permitted to enter the temple and worship the deity at all times, including the annual festival being held at present.\nFurther, directing the two officials to initiate appropriate action in accordance with the law if anyone prevents a section of people from entering the temple, the judge ordered that the Police and the Revenue departments must also ensure that no disturbance is caused to law and order.\nDisposing of a writ petition filed by a local resident A. Venkatesan, complaining of caste-based discrimination, the judge said, the Tamil Nadu Temple Entry Authorization Act of 1947 was enacted after a long struggle by many leaders who wanted to ensure that no one was denied temple entry based on their caste.\nSection 3 of the Act makes it abundantly clear that notwithstanding any law, custom or usage to the contrary, every Hindu, irrespective of their caste or sect to which they belong, shall be entitled to enter any Hindu temple and offer prayers in the same manner and same extent to which another was entitled to do.\n“If anyone is restricted from entering a temple based on caste of sect, it will clearly amount to an actionable wrong/offence and the person concerned (the one who restricts) could be sued or prosecuted therefor,” the judge wrote and said, the public officials were duty-bound to implement the law in letter and spirit.\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner stated the Ayyanar temple in Puthukudi village had been in existence for several decades and worshipped by villagers of all castes and sects for long. However, in 2019, a group of people tried to hijack the temple administration by deciding to construct a new temple on the premises.\nThough the Scheduled Caste residents too had made monetary contributions toward the construction, they were prevented from entering the temple, leading to multiple complaints made to the police as well as revenue officials. However, these complaints could not be pursued for quite some time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the meantime, the offending group demolished all statues and stone structures that had been put up by the Scheduled Caste residents on the temple premises. Even a big statue of Ayyanar that had been installed, with the name of the Scheduled Caste donor, was removed and dumped into the temple well, the petitioner alleged.\nHe also said an iron gate was installed at the Puthukudi Ayyanar Temple and the Scheduled Caste devotees were made to worship the deity only from outside the gate. Despite such discrimination, the government officials had not made any effective intervention in the matter fearing law and order problems, he added.\nFurther, stating that the offending group identifies itself as the ‘Ezhu Vaigaiyara,’ the petitioner sought a direction to permit the Scheduled Caste devotees too to enter the Puthukudi Ayyanar Temple, besides letting them participate in the temple car festival scheduled from July 16 to 31, 2025."

    "content": "In an attempt to find a solution for arental dispute between the landlords and the Tambaram Police Commissioneratefunctioning from a rented property, the Madras High Court, on Thursday (July 17, 2025), wanted to explore the possibility of allowing the Commissionerate to function in the rented premises for two more years on payment of a reasonable amount of enhanced rent with arrears.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh asked Advocate General (A-G) P.S. Raman as well as the counsel for the landlords to come up with a calculation memo by fixing ₹6.33 lakh as the monthly rent for 2022 and then increasing the amount by 10% for every year thereafter. The parties were asked to file the memo by July 21 for passing further orders in the writ petition filed by the landlords seeking vacant possession.\nThe landlords had approached the court contending that they had given their property on rent to the Commissionerate since January 2022 on the basis of an assurance given by the first Commissioner of Police M. Ravi that they would pay a monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh. However, thereafter, the Tamil Nadu government, based on a Public Works Department (PWD) valuation, agreed to pay only ₹6.33 lakh per month.\nSince the offer was not agreeable to them, the landlords insisted on issuing a direction to the Commissionerate to vacate their property. The A-G told the court that the petitioners could not seek such a direction by way of a writ petition just because the tenant happened to be a government entity. He said, all rental disputes must be raised only before the rent control courts.\nHe also stated that the landlords were blowing hot and cold by .claiming on one hand that they want to sell the property forthwith for settling their huge loan dues of ₹130 crore and on the other hand agreeing to let the Commissionerate continue if it pays a monthly rent of ₹18 lakh per month. He said, the landlords had themselves, at one point of time, agreed to accept ₹6.33 lakh albeit for a limited period of time.\nThe A-G also refuted the landlords’ charge of the Police Commissionerate having encroached upon adjacent lands and putting up unauthorised constructions.\nDehors all his submissions on the merits of the case, the A-G said, since the landlords were aged businessmen, they could be paid a reasonable amount of enhanced rent to be fixed by the court and said that he was wiling to file an affidavit of undertaking agreeing to vacate the property after two years since an alternative land had already been identified for construction of the Commissionerate.\nThe A-G said that the orders to be passed in the present writ petition should not be taken as a precedent since most government offices were functioning from rented premises and all those landlords too should not end up filing writ petitions in the future."

    "content": "A child’s anxiety over separation from his mother stirred theSupreme Courtinto reviewing its own judgement in a custody case.\nA 2024 judgment of the apex court had confirmed a Kerala High Court decision to shift the custody of the child permanently from the mother to the biological father. The mother had remarried after the couple’s divorce over a decade ago, and was lately intending to move abroad.\nThe father had moved the High Court, seeking custody of the child. The High Court concluded the move abroad would upend the 12-year-old boy’s stable life, and he ought to stay back in India with his father. The apex court had confirmed the High Court decision on appeal.\nSeeking a review of the judgment, the mother, represented by senior advocate Liz Mathew and advocate Vishnu Sharma A.S., said she had been the primary caregiver of the child since his infancy. The boy had hardly known his father. They had met only during occasional visits over the years.\nThe mother submitted the child had been deeply impacted by the apex court’s judgment. He had since been exhibiting “anxiety and fears, with a high risk for separation anxiety disorder”. She produced evaluation reports from the Christian Medical College, Vellore, to this effect. Ms. Mathew argued the new evidence about the mental condition of the child was a compelling circumstance to entertain the review petition and set aside the judgment.\nIn an open court hearing, which was itself a rare occurrence, a Bench headed by Justice Vikram Nath agreed with Ms. Mathew. The Court concluded its judgment did indeed have a “calamitous effect” on the mental health of the boy.\nThe Court said the welfare and best interests of the child were the paramount considerations in a custody battle case.\nJustice Nath, who authored the judgement, acknowledged the child had been in the exclusive care of the mother since infancy. “He finds refuge in the mother’s arms and finds her presence calming,” the Judge noted. The Court said the stepfather had also provided a “shield of affection” for the child.\n“The minor child in question is presently 12 years old and at the cusp of adolescence. The factors defining the best interests of a child are multiple and range from quality education, a nurturing family environment, healthy worldly experiences, provision of basic amenities of life, meeting of financial requirements, access to a friendly social system to imparting of spiritual and cultural learnings. The list is naturally not an exhaustive one. However, the essential feature is that a secure, supportive and loving family forms the bedrock of a healthy childhood,” the Court said.\nGranting the biological father visitation rights, the Court said he must not make any crude remarks to the child which may impact the latter’s well-being. “A father-son relation can only be fostered patiently over the course of years,” Justice Nath observed."

The family had a narrow escape.\nThe incident occurred around 8.30 p.m. when a huge rock tumbled down a hill adjacent to the house of Mithesh, an employee at a local tyre shop. The boulder fell on the bedroom. At the time, Mithesh and his mother were sitting outside the house and his wife, C.H. Chaitra, and children had gone to a nearby temple.\nA damaged after a massive boulder rolled down a hillside and crashed onto it at Nadakal in  Chandragiri in Kasaragod on Wednesday night\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\nHearing a loud sound, neighbours rushed to the scene. Though a portion of the house was destroyed, no casualties were reported. The loss is estimated at ₹2 lakh.\nSoon after the incident, the tahsildar, village officer, and officials from the Collectorate and the local panchayat visited the site to assess the damage.\nThe family, however, alleged apathy by the authorities. Ms. Chaitra said that two months ago, she had submitted a written complaint to the village officer and other officials concerned on the potential danger posed by loose rocks and overhanging trees on a hill owned by a man named Habib. The complaint explicitly stated the possibility of the massive rock falling onto the house. “Though the village officer visited the place, he left after a few minutes stating that the rock posed no danger,” she alleged. No preventive action was taken despite the complaint, she added.\nThe National Disaster Response Force team and other officials conducted an inspection at the site and directed the family to relocate to a safer place. The family has decided to move temporarily to their relative’s house."

    "content": "Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy clarified that the Jal Shakti Ministry itself confirmed there was no discussion on the Banakacherla project during the inter-State meeting on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) where both theTelangana and Andhra Pradesh Chief Ministers participated in the presence of Union Jal Shakthi Minister C.R. Patil.\n“How can problems be solved without discussions with the Centre?” questioned Mr. Revanth. “Even India and Pakistan hold talks on water distribution. What’s wrong if I speak to the neighbouring State’s CM? This is about the people’s interests, not political showmanship,” he said in an informal interaction with reporters in New Delhi on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nTaking a swipeat the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), he said, “I am not an engineer. Decisions will come after technical studies. People gave me the authority to work with the Central government. Should I go to farmhouse or New Delhi to get the issues resolved?” he asked, taking a jibe at former Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao.\nHe also announced his intent to visit New Delhi twice a month to work in coordination with various Union Ministries, as continuous dialogue with the Centre was essential to protect Telangana’s interests, particularly on crucial issues like water sharing.\nMr. Reddy also confirmed plans to meet the Maharashtra Chief Minister on the Tummidihatti project soon. “When KCR met with Chandrababu and Jaganmohan Reddy, he claimed it as a victory. Now they say it’s wrong if I meet them [A.P. leaders]. If I don’t attend these meetings, who will present Telangana’s case before the Centre?,” he asked.\nContinuing his attack on the BRS leadership, Mr. Reddy alleged that BRS working president K.T. Rama Rao’s close circles were involved in drug abuse. “KTR’s friend Kedar died of a drug overdose in Dubai, and we secured the forensic report to Telangana,” he claimed.\nThe Chief Minister further attacked KTR saying thathis sister K. Kavithawas not willing to accept her brother’s leadership and has exposed the internal bickering. “KTR ran away when I challenged him for a debate in the past.”\nThe Chief Minister also questioned the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) inaction, despite evidence, in cases like the sheep distribution scam, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) irregularities, and the Formula E race. “The ED has taken the evidence we gathered, yet there is no arrest of KCR, KTR or Harish Rao,” he said, accusing the Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy of not following up with the concerned Ministry.\nOn the ongoing investigations in Telangana, he said investigations against KCR, KTR, and Harish Rao will continue. “The High Court is looking into the phone-tapping issue,” he said."

    "content": "A grand tribute to the life and legacy of communist stalwart A.K. Gopalan is taking shape in his native village, Peralassery in Kannur district. AKG Museum that is getting ready for inauguration is designed to resonate with future generations and is being constructed on a 3.21-acre plot acquired by the Kerala government near the famed Peralassery suspension bridge.\nThe museum project, envisioned as a cultural and historical centre, was set in motion when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan laid the foundation stone in February 2021. With a total outlay of ₹25 crore, covering land acquisition, construction and infrastructure, the initiative is being implemented in multiple phases.\nIn the first phase, a two-storey museum building spanning 10,737 sq ft has been completed at a cost of ₹6.59 crore. The Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society is carrying out the construction. Electrical work and boundary wall have been completed, and finishing touches are progressing rapidly.\nThe museum promises a multi-dimensional experience of A.K Gopalan’s life, struggles, and political journey. Seven galleries based on modern museology principles will trace his evolution from a grassroots organiser to a national leader. Visitors will navigate through curated visuals, rare documents, archival photograph and exhibits enhanced by augmented and virtual reality technologies. A digital library will provide deeper access to AKG’s writings, speeches and historical documents, while documentaries on his life will be screened regularly.\nIn keeping with its community-oriented design, the museum also houses an office, longue, conference hall, restrooms and a scaled-down version of the iconic Indian Coffee House, an ode to the spaces where political discourse once brewed.\nPhase two will see the development of a landscaped park and aesthetic linkage extending to the nearby suspension bridge, making the museum a part of the broader cultural fabric of Peralassery.\n“All major works will be completed before December and the museum will be ready for inauguration,” said A.V. Sheeba, president, Peralassery grama panchayat.\nOnce inaugurated the AKG Museum will not only add to the legacy of one of Kerala’s most-revered leaders but also offer a space for reflection and learning for students, political enthusiasts and historians alike."

    "content": "Over 40 staff nurses employed on a contractual basis by the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Recruitment Board (MRB) at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in Tiruchi have expressed concern over the prolonged delay in sanctioning their pay raise.\nAccording to a Government Order with effect from May 1, 2021, the nurses’ salaries were increased from ₹14,000 to ₹18,000, with a 5% annual increment applicable from their date of joining until their date of transfer to time scale of pay.\nWhile a significant number of nurses have benefited from the increase in the past three years through regularisation, at least 400 continue to wait for their turn throughout the State.\n“There are approximately 46 nurses who have not got the proposed salary raise at the MGMGH, despite their long years of service. It has been four years since the 2021 order, but we are being given excuses each time we raise the issue,” V. Sara, a nurse working at the Tiruchi GH, toldThe Hindu.\nMs. Sara, who pursued the matter through a Right to Information (RTI) petition on behalf of affected nurses, presented a request to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on his recent visit to the city.\nNurses under government service can earn upwards of ₹30,000 as salaries.\n“Though we are working just like the government staff nurses, MRB nurses are still receiving ₹14,000. We get an annual increment of ₹500; those earning ₹18,000 are getting ₹900 as increment. It is unfortunate that such pay disparity exists on different levels within the nursing staff cadre,” said Ms. Sara.\nMany nurses said that it was hard to make ends meet with the current salary. “New appointees under the National Health Mission schemes after 2021 are earning more than us. We have appeared for eligibility exams like the others, so why should we be discriminated against?” asked a nurse from Karur Medical College.\nNurses who have migrated from rural areas said that their salary could not cover their living expenses. “I have to pay rent for a room in Jayamkondan, where I work, and support my family in my village, since my husband’s agricultural income is not regular,” said Ruth, a nurse with five years of experience.\n“The word ‘contract’ is used in our employment, though it does not specify its time duration or validity. MRB nurses work as hard as their colleagues who are on a regular government pay scale. It is unfair to delay the resolution of their pay raise,” said R.M. Vignesh, State joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Government MRB Nurses Empowerment Association."

Without such approval, any enquiry/inquiry/investigation undertaken would be void ab initio,\" the plea added.\nMr. Yadav called it a scenario of \"regime revenge and political vendetta\" as the initiation of investigation without such approval vitiated the entire proceedings since inception with the being a \"jurisdictional error\"."

    "content": "Following the Wall Street Journal report on the Air India AI171 crash, aviation expert Sanjay Lazar on Thursday (July 17, 2025) expressed concern over the leak of investigation details in the United States.\nHe pointed out that while the American report claims the flight commander may have switched off the fuel controls, India's official preliminary report only contains a short pilot denial and lacks the full cockpit voice recorder transcript.\nMr. Lazar questioned why the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript was not shared in the preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and said it is worrying that a foreign media outlet appears to have more information than Indian authorities or the public.\nSpeaking toANI, Sanjay Lazar said, \"The Wall Street Journal this morning has released a report, which suggested that the commander of the flight AI171 had undone the fuel switches. The preliminary report of the AAIB of India has only released a single statement, a very bold statement, which says, \"Why did you cut it off? And the pilot replied, No, I did not.\" Given this single statement, I do not believe that there is ample scope for us to make a determination. The preliminary report failed to provide the entire transcript of the CVR. What is strange is that the AAIB preliminary report is being disclosed and leaked in the United States. And that brings a greater worry for all of us in India because this is an independent organisation controlled by the government of India. Yet the Wall Street Journal seems to know more about it than any of us in India, our parliament, or the Civil Aviation Ministry.\"\nMr. Lazar said there should be a judicial probe into the Air India AI171 crash to ensure full transparency and accountability. He said an appeal should be made to the Prime Minister to order an inquiry led by a sitting High Court judge.\n\"The Federation of Indian Pilots has expressed its dissatisfaction with the report and the role of the AAIB. I concur fully with this. We should make an appeal to the Prime Minister of India, seeking complete transparency and a judicial probe into this matter by a sitting High Court judge to ensure accountability and transparency throughout this process,\" Mr. Lazar said.\nA cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the Air India flight that crashed last month indicated that the captain turned off the switches that controlled fuel flowing to the plane's engines, Reuters reported, citing the Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday.\nAs perReuters,The Wall Street Journalreport cited people familiar with U.S. officials' early assessment of evidence uncovered in the investigation into the crash, which killed 260 people.The recording suggested that the first officer, who was flying the Boeing aircraft, opened the new tab 787 Dreamliner, asked the other captain, who was more experienced, why he moved the switches to the \"cutoff\" position after it climbed off the runway, the report said.\nThe first officer expressed surprise and then panicked, while the captain seemed to remain calm,Reutersreported, citingWSJ.\nIndia's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Boeing and Air India have not yet responded to the report.The two pilots involved were Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.\nA preliminary report released last week by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before the June 12 crash, and raised fresh questions over the position of the critical engine fuel cutoff switches.\nMeanwhile, Air India on Wednesday announced the successful completion of precautionary inspections on the locking mechanism of the Fuel Control Switch (FCS) across its fleet of Boeing 787-8 aircraft."

He reportedly slipped while on the roof of the shed and touched the electric line, which was hanging dangerously low.”\nMidhun’s mother, who works as a home nurse, had gone to Kuwait three months ago. “We have not yet been able to contact her to inform the news of her son’s death. According to our information, she is currently in Turkey. Efforts are under way to reach her,” Mr. Sivarajan added.\nThe students who witnessed the incident were left traumatised. “When I saw him, he was lying on the electric wire. Foam and froth were coming from his mouth. It was a terrifying scene. Everyone tried to save him,” said a student of the school.\nThe school is located in Mynagappally grama panchayat. P.M. Said, president of the panchayat, placed the blame squarely on the school management and the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). “The school is managed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). First of all, there should not have been an electric line running through the school compound. The key question is, why did the school authorities fail to take steps to relocate the line despite the risk?” Mr. Said asked."

Annamalai on Thursday (July 17, 2025) said he stands byUnion Home Minister Amit Shah’s positionthat a coalition government will be formed in Tamil Nadu if the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is voted to power in the State next year. He said if the AIADMK, which heads the NDA in Tamil Nadu, holds a different view on this matter, the party can take it up with Mr. Shah (considered a key strategist of the BJP).\nSpeaking to the media after appearing at the Saidapet Court in connection with adefamation case filed against himby DMK MP T.R. Baalu, Mr. Annamalai said the alliance was conceived by the Union Home Minister himself and that he had no role in reviving the ties between the AIADMK and BJP. “As a party worker, it is my duty to stand by what my leaders say. Amit Shahjihas clearly spoken about this [coalition government] several times in his interviews to various dailies,” he said.\nResponding toremarks made by DMK Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Sivaon veteran Congress leader K. Kamaraj, he said the DMK had no right to talk about the late leader, as the party was solely responsible for defeating him in the 1967 elections by “spreading lies.” Later, when there was a split in the Congress party, the DMK aligned with the faction led by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and prevented Kamaraj from emerging as a national leader. He also alleged Mr. Siva had misrepresented history by distorting the truth.\nFurther, Mr. Annamalai said the DMK should release a white paper on the poll promises it had made in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections. He also claimed several alliance partners of the DMK are on the verge of exiting the coalition."

Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan said it was “not at all convinced” by the manner in which the High Court exercised its discretion.\nThe Bench asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the actor, to give “good reasons” why it should not interfere with bail order.\n“To be very honest with you, we are not convinced with the manner in which the high court has exercised discretion. Very honestly, we will say this. We will hear you because your clients are on bail; they have come for cancellation of bail and you must have seen the manner in which the high court had dictated the order,” Justice Pardiwala told Mr. Sibal.\nMr. Sibal asked the Bench to examine the statements of key witnesses recorded by the police and the judicial magistrate.\nOn being asked as to which part of the High Court’s order was troubling the Bench, Justice Pardiwala referred to the portion where the High Court was looking for “how to release them (accused) on bail”.\n“You need to convince us that there is no good reason for this court to interfere,” the Bench said.\nThe Bench told senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Karnataka, to inform about antecedents, if any, of the accused persons on the next hearing on July 22.\nThe Bench was hearing a plea filed by the State Government challenging the High Court’s December 13, 2024 order granting bail to Darshan and other co-accused.\nDarshan, along with actressPavithra Gowdaand several others,is accused of abducting and torturing33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan whoallegedly sent obscene messagesto Pavithra.\nThe police alleged the victim was held in a shed in Bengaluru for three days in June 2024, tortured and his body was recovered from a drain.\nThe top court on January 24issued the notices to the actor, Pavithra Gowda, and others in the case on the plea of the state government. In the interim order, the Bench refused to cancel the bail granted to them in the case.\nWatch: Kannada actor Darshan arrest case | All you need to know\nDarshan case: Why it is unfair to blame the Kannada film industry at large\nWatch: Four high-profile crime cases and quest for justice | Decode Karnataka\nThe top court then observed it wasn’t “proper to stay the operation” of the bail order, as it would amount to cancellation of bail, as prayed by the State.\nDarshan was arrested on June 11, 2024, for allegedly killing his fan Renukaswamy on June 8 the same year after he reportedly sent obscene messages to Gowda.\nThe actor was arrested and lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Jail in Bengaluru but when a photograph of him relaxing with some other jail inmates went viral, he was transferred to Ballari Central Jail.\nThe State moved to the top court against the bail on January 6, 2025. The mortal remains of 33-year-old Renukaswamy, an autorickshaw driver, were discovered on June 9, 2024.\nHe allegedly succumbed to injuries after being attacked on the orders of Darshan, who reportedly urged his fans to accost and kidnap Renukaswamy for posting derogatory comments about Gowda on social media.\nThe Karnataka High Court granted Darshan an interim bail on medical grounds for six weeks on October 30, 2024 butgranted regular bail in December 2024."

However, the Lokayukta proceedings were subsequently closed citing lack of jurisdiction.\nMr. Kumaraswamy has maintained in the High Court that the land was purchased by him, and he was a political target for theCongressgovernment in the State.\nThe present Congress regime in the State argued that the allegations wereprima facietrue.\nA contempt case was filed in the High Court on the ground that the State did not comply with its assurance to take action against the encroachments as recorded in the January 2020 order. During this time, revenue authorities issued eviction notice to Mr. Kumaraswamy on the basis of the contempt proceedings.\nMr. Kumaraswamy, represented by senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, and advocates Balaji Srinivasan and Rohini Musa, had approached the apex court, arguing that he had been issued eviction notice on the basis of a contempt case in which he was not even a party. The lawyers had termed the turn of events as a “comedy of errors”.\nThe  apex court had granted him liberty to approach the High Court with this plea. The High Court responded by impleading the Union Minister in the contempt proceedings in the April 17 order."

    "content": "An international team led by astronomers from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) here has discovered radio emission with a special property known as circular polarisation near a massive young protostar that is still forming about 4,500 light years from earth. [Protostar refers to the earliest known stage of a star when it is still accumulating gas and dust material from its surroundings.]\nThe discovery linked to IRAS 18162-2048, a massive protostar in the Milky Way galaxy, opens an exciting window into scientists’ understanding of how massive stars form, astronomers at the IIST said on Thursday.\nCircular polarisation occurs when electric and magnetic field vectors of electromagnetic waves—in this case radio waves—rotate in a circle about the direction in which the waves travel through space. This emission offers the first direct clue to the strength of magnetic fields in the immediate neighbourhood of a protostar, they said.\nThe findings have been published inThe Astrophysical Journal Lettersunder the title ‘First Detection of Circular Polarization in Radio Continuum Toward a Massive Protostar.’\nIn the early stage, the protostar can also eject high-velocity material in opposite directions, known as a bipolar jet. ‘Massive protostars’ evolve to have mass more than 8 to 10 times that of the Sun.\nAccording to the astronomers, IRAS 18162-2048 powers one of the largest and brightest known protostellar jets in the Milky Way, the HH80-81 jet. It is believed that the magnetic field and rotation in the protostellar system are responsible for the ejection of the jet. While a magnetic field has been imaged from the jet earlier, this is the first time that hints of it have been detected directly from this massive protostar, according to the IIST.\nStrong magnetic fields have been observed earlier in low-mass protostars that go on to form stars like the Sun. But measuring such fields around massive protostars has remained elusive, until now.\n“Massive protostars are much harder to study. The circular polarisation we are looking for is very faint and sporadic, making such measurements very challenging,” Amal George Cheriyan from the IIST, lead author of the paper, said in a statement.\nThe radio observations were carried out using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s (NRAO) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in the U.S.\n“This is the first inference of the magnetic field strength using circular polarisation in radio waves from a massive protostar,” said Sarita Vig of the IIST who conceptualised the work.\n“The detection of circular polarisation is an exceptionally rare and challenging feat even in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where conditions are extreme, but better investigated,” Nirupam Roy from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, said. Samir Mandal of the IIST noted that observing the phenomenon in the environment of a massive protostar, which lies buried in dense gas and dust, is even more difficult, making this result remarkable.\nThe new data has allowed researchers to infer that the magnetic field near the protostar is roughly 100 times stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field. They also support a long-standing theory that powerful jets from stars and black holes are driven by the same magnetic engine."

    "content": "Nothing enlivens courtroom dramas than fiery arguments, which open new pathways into our understanding of a case. InJanaki V Vs State of Kerala, celebrated advocate David Abel Donovan (Suresh Gopi)‘s arguments are full of fire. Still, a significant portion of them are so irrelevant that they would fit more in a loud television debate than in a courtroom. He is the kind of person who would talk about cheese when he is supposed to argue about chalk. So, it is no wonder that he would go on a long diatribe against the State’s developmental projects when he is arguing in court in a case related to sexual assault, or that he would ask a rape victim whether she watches porn and how often.\nThe opening credit sequences of the film hint at this behaviour with news clippings of his various press statements on a host of issues, all of which reveal a lawyer who is more active outside the court than inside.Janaki V Vs State of Kerala, which arrives in theatres with an extra ‘V’ thanks to the diktats of the censors, is caught between the need to tell a sensitive story and projecting the superhero aura of the actor playing the advocate. Debutant director Praveen Narayanan, who has also written the film, struggles on both counts.\nJanaki (Anupama Parameswaran), an IT professional in Bengaluru, becomes the victim of rape in her hometown when she is on vacation. In the courtroom exchanges that follow, the chain of events falls under intense scrutiny. Right from the early sequences, the filmmaker makes it clear that subtlety is not something he would strive. Everything comes with loud visual and audio cues, leaving no doubts in the minds of the audience.\nThe writing, as well as the filmmaking, harks back to the 1990s. The thinly veiled references to contemporary issues become a convenient writing option. However, when the film proclaims its pet original ideas, one wishes that it had stayed with the borrowed ones. One of these ideas, which forms the core of the film, regarding the paternity of a child born out of rape, is probably one of the most outlandish ideas heard in cinema in recent years. It, in a way, trivialises a serious issue, by turning it into an outright political weapon.\nALSO READ:JSK–Janaki vs State of Keralarow:Isn’t demand for change of name of film a challenge to freedom of creative expression, asks Kerala HC\nMany of the arguments irrelevant to the case uttered by the advocate are also political, fitting in with the real-life persona of the actor. For a courtroom drama, there is hardly any scene that makes an impact. As if to excite the audience lulled by the sluggish drama, there is an unnecessary jump scare sequence, which seems inspired from a B-grade horror movie. Songs further drag down the narrative.\nWith its insensitive take on an important issue,Janaki V Vs State of Keralabecomes a film as pointless as the letter ‘V’, which was added to Janaki’s name to satisfy the whims of the censors.\nJanaki V Vs State of Kerala is currently running in theatres"

    "content": "Ahead of the State government’s ‘Sadhana Samavesha’ to be held in Mysuru on Saturday, the BJP in the city dubbed it as a “celebration of non-performance”.\nAddressing the media here on Thursday, senior functionaries of the city BJP said that the event was laughable, as there was nothing to celebrate. Party functionaries M.A. Mohan and former MLA L. Nagendra said that there was an “administrative collapse” in the State and that the law and order situation had deteriorated.\n“While there was an increase in crimes of various nature across the State, the police does not have a free hand to investigate and crackdown on the culprits due to the interference of the Congress leaders,” Mr. Mohan alleged. “The only achievement of this government led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is that it has survived for two years,” he added.\nThe BJP leaders said that the Congress was content with just talking about the five guarantee schemes, but claimed that its benefits were questionable. “While women have been given free rides under the Shakti scheme, the government has raised fuel charges, thus cross-subsidising the scheme with public money,” said Mr. Mohan.\nBJP leaders also criticised the State government for its “inability” to make timely payment to the beneficiaries. “This is a government which does not have funds to pay salaries to the government staff on time, and hence it is too much to expect timely disbursement of money under the scheme,” they added.\nThe government’s tenure has been marked by lack of any development works and this is due to the fact that none of the licensed contractors were keen to take up government works as their collective arrears was in excess of ₹33,000 crore, according to the BJP, which reiterated their earlier stand that the Sadhana Samavesha was nothing more than a show of strength.\nSchemes like the ‘Yuva Nidhi’ were criticised as being available only on paper by the BJP leaders, who said that in contrast, certain Central government programmes like the ‘Mudra Yojana’ offered real financial support to the youth.\n“Narendra Modi is working to make people self-reliant, while this government is busy with publicity shows to hide its failures,” the BJP functionaries said."

He further explained that this report suggests a challenge-and-response dynamic exists between the two pilots, with one questioning the other, and a state of confusion.\n“The report uses a particular word - ‘transitioned’. Thefuel control switches transitioned, according to the report. This report suggests that a challenge-and-response dynamic exists between the two pilots, with one questioning the other, and a state of confusion between the pilots, potentially leading to a breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM),” Captain Dhalla said.\n“If any changes were made due to a failure in this aircraft, they would have used these switches to regain power. If there was a problem with the locking mechanism of these switches, then the pilots were also helpless,” Captain Dhalla added further.\nMeanwhile, the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) President, C.S. Randhawa, on Thursday (July 17, 2025), condemned a media report that claimed that the captain of the flight deliberately cut off fuel to the engines.\nCaptain Randhawa emphasised that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report makes no mention of the pilots turning off the switches controlling fuel flow to the engines.\n“Nowhere in the report has it been mentioned that the fuel control switch was turned off due to the pilot’s mistake. I condemn the article. They have not read the report properly, and will take action against them through FIP,” said Captain Randhawa.\nFurthermore, he urged people not to comment on the AAIB’s preliminary report, as this might create undue fear among commuters about air travel.\nThe two pilots involved were Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kunder, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.\nA preliminary report released last week by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before the June 12 crash and raised fresh questions over the position of the critical engine fuel cutoff switches, the report said.\nThe AI 171 crash of the Boeing Dreamliner 787-8 aircraft in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, killed 260 people, including 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and 19 people on the ground."

    "content": "A large multicentre study of 587 children with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu has revealed that scrub typhus, a bacterial infection, is now the most common infectious cause of AES in southern India.\nThe study by a team of researchers from NIMHANS, Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health,  Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, and St. John’s Medical College Hospital has been recently published in The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia.\nAES, characterised by acute onset fever and altered mental status and/or new seizures, presents a significant global public health challenge. It has an incidence of 3.5 to 13.8 cases per 1,00,000 patient-years, disproportionately affects children, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\nIn India, over 10,000 cases of AES are reported annually to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP).\nHistorically, surveillance efforts have prioritised Japanese encephalitis (JE), even as its incidence has significantly declined due to widespread vaccination. Moreover, recent studies reveal a dynamic, region-specific, and evolving aetiology of AES in India. Scrub typhus (caused by bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi), an under-recognised cause of AES, has been increasingly reported in certain regions.\nAimed at systematically investigating infectious aetiologies of AES in children from southern India and developing clinical prediction models for diagnosing scrub typhus, the study found that the bacterial infection is now the most common infectious cause (44%) of AES in southern India, far exceeding Japanese encephalitis virus (11%).\nScrub typhus and other doxycycline-treatable infections are significant contributors of AES in India. However, limited surveillance in southern India has hindered their recognition and the inclusion of doxycycline in treatment protocols.\nThe prospective study enrolled children aged above 28 days to 18 years with AES presenting to three tertiary care hospitals in Bengaluru - Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, Vani Vilas, and St. John Medical College Hospital. Primary outcomes were microbiological diagnosis of AES and clinical prediction models for diagnosing scrub typhus and identifying patients with doxycycline-treatable causes. Models were developed using multivariable logistic regression, internally validated, and simplified into point-scoring systems.\nBetween March 2020 and February 2023, 714 children were screened, of whom 587 were included. Of these, 315 (54%) had a microbiological diagnosis. Scrub typhus accounted for 138/315 (44%), and doxycycline-treatable causes were diagnosed in 193/315 (61%) of these cases. Key predictors associated with both scrub typhus and doxycycline-treatable causes were age, illness duration, lymphadenopathy, oedema, hepatomegaly, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and serum albumin levels, said Tina Damodar, clinical virologist and DBT-Welcome Trust fellow, Department of Neurovirology at NIMHANS, who is the lead author of the study.\n“Among the 315 children with an identified infectious cause, dengue (10%), leptospira (5%), and chikungunya (5%) were also notable. Other detected pathogens included herpes viruses, enteroviruses, pneumococcus, tuberculosis, and measles, reflecting a diverse and region-specific AES landscape. These findings highlight the need to update AES surveillance and treatment protocols,” Dr. Damodar toldThe Hinduon Thursday.\n“The study found that over 60% of microbiologically confirmed AES cases were caused by doxycycline-treatable infections, primarily scrub typhus. Despite this, doxycycline is not routinely included in empirical AES treatment in many parts of India,” she said.\nAnother author Reeta S. Mani, head of Neurovirology at NIMHANS, said that based on the results, the study recommends including doxycycline or azithromycin in the initial treatment of children with AES or acute febrile illness (AFI) in southern India - a change already implemented at the participating referral tertiary care hospitals.\n“Timely treatment is critical. Among the 138 children with scrub typhus, nearly 40% either died or developed neurological complications, largely due to delayed diagnosis. To address this, the study calls for wider availability of scrub typhus diagnostic tests (IgM ELISA or PCR) at primary and secondary care levels,” the doctor said.\nThe researchers have also developed a clinical prediction model - a simple point-based tool that can help frontline clinicians identify children likely to benefit from doxycycline, even before lab confirmation is available."

Kurnool Traffic Circle Inspector Mansuruddin toldThe Hinduthat the traffic wing got one exclusive drone and the same was used from Raj Vihar circle to C-Camp on Tuesday (July 15). The drone covered nearly two kilometres and the visuals were clear, he added.\n“We noticed violations such as triple-riding, mobile phone driving and wrong route driving and cases have been filed against 30 violators,” he said.\nMr. Mansurrudin said that the drone would be used over the main thoroughfares and also to monitor the flow of traffic at important junctions in the city. “We can easily know when there is traffic congestion in any area and immediately send our mobile teams to clear it,” the inspector said.\n“Being the district headquarters and Hyderabad–Bengaluru national highway passing through the city, the vehicular movement is always high,” the official said and added that lack of proper parking places, encroachment of pavements and vendors setting up shops on the roads is adding to the problem.\nThe city traffic wing has a strength of 60 officers who work in two shifts. At least 80-90 personnel are required to man the traffic and ensure there are no snarls. Officials are positive that the usage of drones will ease the pressure on them and also address the lack of sufficient manpower."

    "content": "Hours after announcement of free electricity up to 125 units per month in Bihar, ahead of Assembly elections in that State by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, several Ministers in the ruling Congress in Karnataka claimed that the NDA led by the BJP has been copying ‘guarantees’ implemented by the Congress in the State.\nSpeaking to reporters, Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, Ministers Santosh Lad, K.J. George, and Laxmi Hebbalkar said that the BJP had been criticising five ‘guarantees’ implemented by the Congress here, but copying the same for luring voters in the coming Assembly in Bihar.\nMr. George said the BJP had exposed itself by implementing the Congress guarantee in Bihar and other States. “Why is the BJP adopting double standards when it comes to guarantees?“ he asked. The State government has been implementing the “Gruha Jyoti” scheme which exempted households from paying for electricity up to 200 units in a month."

The man was observed to have made several complaints but no action was taken.\n\"Father of the child apprehends that the petitioner has been facilitated to flee out of the jurisdiction of this court. She was statedly seen entering the Russian Embassy through a back door on July 4, 2025 along with a Russian diplomat, with whom she is alleged to have some relationship. It is further alleged that the police have failed to provide protection to the minor child, thereby defying the directions issued by this court,\" the bench said.\nThe top court, therefore, directed the Ministry of External Affairs officials to liaise with the relevant authorities in the Russian embassy and seek permission to enter into the residential premises of the diplomat, who was last seen in her company on July 4, 2025.\n\"Keeping in mind the comity, diplomatic relationship, and autonomy enjoyed on a reciprocal basis by different embassies, we are not issuing any directions in respect of the officers of the Russian Embassy in India. However, we do not hesitate to observe that if, on the basis of the police report, we find any diplomatic personnel attached or connected to the said embassy has prima facie committed an offence within the framework of the penal laws of this country, the law must take its own course.\"\nThe bench for now advised the highest authority in the Russian embassy to assist the Indian authorities, including the Delhi police to ensure directions of this court, issued from time to time, were not violated.\nThe top court further noted getting \"very evasive and vague replies\" upon inquiries made about the woman's whereabouts which raised \"serious doubts\" on the bonafide conduct of her counsel.\nThe bench's order was directed to be shared with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, Delhi police commissioner for information and necessary compliance.\n\"The officials at the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs, Union of India are also directed to communicate this order to all international airports and other ports within India, and the immigration authorities be intimated to ensure that neither the petitioner (woman) nor the minor child is permitted to leave the country,\" the order said.\nThe top court posted the hearing on July 18, when it asked the authorities concerned to file a status report.\nThe bench had previously remarked that in a \"furious fight\" between the husband and wife over the child, several speaking orders were passed by the court from time to time.\nThe top court on May 22, 2025 directed that the exclusive custody of the child was given to the mother for three days in a week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and for the remaining days, the child was directed to remain in the exclusive custody of his father.\nThe mother of the child is a Russian citizen, who has been residing in India since 2019, initially coming to India on an X-1 Visa, which expired subsequently.\nHowever, during the pendency of the court proceedings, the top court directed the extension of the visa from time to time.\nOn May 22, the top court directed the Deputy Commissioners of Police (South East and South) and the station house officers of Lajpat Nagar and Defence Colony Police stations to maintain a discreet but effective vigil over the residential premises of both parties."

Govindan told reporters here on Thursday that the grave accusation that the IUML leadership had paid four times more than the current market value to purchase 3.5 acres of land from a top functionary’s close relative ostensibly to build houses for families rendered homeless in the 2024 landslides prima facie smacked of entrenched nepotism.\n“Moreover, the suspicious transaction appeared to be an exercise in futility. The Meppadi village officer has disallowed construction on 2.5 acres of the IUML land citing serious environmental concerns,” he said.\nMr. Govindan said the Youth Congress had set a target of ₹2.5 lakh for every Assembly constituency. “Now, the outfit says it has only ₹89 lakh in its account. Its leadership seemed suspiciously reluctant to reveal the accounts, and the money in its kitty remains unspent,” he said.\nMr. Govindan noted that senior Congress leaders, notably P.J. Kurien and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, have been openly critical of the Youth Congress leadership’s current self-promotional political trajectory.\nHe stated that the Congress veterans felt that the Youth Congress leadership led an ivory tower existence far removed from the travails of ordinary people and seemed mono-maniacally fixated on creating “self-promotional” social media content instead of championing public causes.\nHe noted that Mr. Kurien lauded the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) for placing themselves at the forefront against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) bid to saffronise State-funded universities and undermine their administrative and intellectual autonomy.\nIn contrast, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, Mr. Govindan said, brazenly towed the RSS’s line by terming the SFI-DYFI fight against Governor Rajendra Arlekar, who is also the Chancellor of State universities, as “criminal hooliganism”."

    "content": "G.K. Panikkar, director, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, Thiruvananthapuram, on Thursday said that the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru, has the potential to become the world’s topmost institution in the field of language-related study and research and in finding out solutions to language-related problems.\n“For sustainable development of Indian languages and for protection of the cultural ethos of Indian people, I appeal to the Government of India to strengthen the CIIL, giving it necessary freedom, and academic, financial and administration support,” he said, in his address as the chief guest at the 57th foundation day of the CIIL here.\nMr. Panikkar praised the CIIL for its work in the protection and documentation of minor languages. Almost all tribal languages of India, including those with less than 10,000 speakers had been analysed by CIIL researchers, who prepared grammars and lexicons for them, he explained.\nHe further said that textbooks were prepared for primary classes to enable tribal students to have their early education in their own mother tongue itself, and then switch over to the major language of their respective regions.\n“As a part of CIIL’s role to promote multilingualism and its efforts for the effective implementation of the three-language formula, school teachers were trained in different languages — especially South Indian languages to the teachers of North Indian states,” he stated.\n“I think this project successfully continues even now by expanding its scope to all the major languages of the country. It now trains teachers in second language teaching methodologies providing them with linguistics orientation,” he added.\nHe said that the application of AI and other technological innovations may also be helpful to CIIL for solving many of our present-day problems. Similarly, steps towards equipping one’s mother tongue for higher education such as the preparation of dictionaries of science terms in regional languages and so on are the need of the hour, he added.\nOn the occasion, the ‘Bhasha Sanchika’ portal — a digital language repository of CIIL, which is described as a pioneering platform where language preservation, dissemination, and technology converges, was launched.\nThe launch of the Bhasha Sanchika (Language Archive of India) marks a significant milestone in CIIL’s ongoing efforts to safeguard India’s linguistic diversity. Developed using D-Space, a widely adopted open-source digital asset management system, the portal serves as a resource hub for the promotion, documentation, and preservation of Indian languages and cultural heritage, according to CIIL.\nCIIL Director Shailendra Mohan presided over the event. Former CIIL Directors, language experts, and other dignitaries were present. The inaugural event was followed by panel discussions."

    "content": "A crucial stretch of the Kasaragod-Kanhangad State highway is teetering on the brink of destruction as sea erosion worsens at the Thrikannad coastline, reducing parts of the road to a dangerous state and alarming residents and authorities.\nThe land on the seaward side of the Thrikannad road has already been partially washed away, leaving a gaping hole and a sunken road near the historic Trimbakeshwar temple. With the sea just five metres from the tarmac, fears are mounting that the entire section could be swallowed if urgent action is not taken.\n“The people residing along the coast are facing huge problems. We have seen erosion over the years, but never like this.”\nIn response to the rapidly deteriorating situation, local MLAs C.H. Kunhambu and M. Rajagopalan met Water Resources Minister Roshi Augustine in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday (July 16) to seek immediate intervention. The Minister assured them that an initial allocation of ₹25 lakh would be sanctioned for temporary protective measures to curb further erosion. “This road is a lifeline for thousands,” said Mr. Kunhambu. “We cannot afford to lose it. The situation is grave and demands an emergency response.”\nThe police have already flagged the issue in a report submitted to the District Collector, warning that a serious disaster is imminent if corrective action is delayed. The report cites the collapse of road edges and potential risks to vehicles and commuters, especially at night.\nHeavy rains on Wednesday night worsened the situation, with large parts of the Kerala State Transport Project road submerged. In Thrikannad, the soil beneath the road has been loosened and dragged away by the restless waves, creating voids and weakening the structure.\n“We are not just worried about the road,” said Sulekha, a member of the local panchayat. “If the erosion continues unchecked, houses and places of worship nearby could also be in danger. We need a permanent sea wall, not just a stopgap solution.”\nThe State government’s initial promise of funds has brought some relief, but locals stress the need for a comprehensive, long-term coastal protection strategy, especially with changing weather patterns and rising sea levels compounding the risk.\nAs of now, the Thrikannad stretch remains precariously close to collapse. Residents and commuters continue to navigate the road cautiously, even as the sea looms menacingly just metres away."

He sent the letter on June 12.\nLater, he withheld his request after persuasion by the Chief Minister, Home Minister G. Parameshwara and Minister H.K. Patil.  He rejoined duty in Dharwad on July 3.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Baramani dismissed as baseless rumours speculation that he was planning to join the BJP and contest from Belagavi North Assembly Constituency.\nMr. Baramani who joined service as a Sub-Inspector has had a chequered career. He was known as a tough officer who tried to end rowdyism in Belagavi, during the tenure of Hemant Nimbalkar as Superintendent of Police.\nResident organisations feted him, along with other officers like Mahantesh Jiddi, for eliminating anti-social elements in the city.\nHe has also faced some controversy. He was suspended in 2008 on the charge of amassing disproportionate amounts of wealth.\nThe Lokayukta found that Mr. Baramani accumulated disproportionate assets to the tune of 93% in excess of his known sources of income and that he created assets like a stone crusher, farmland and house during his service between 1994 and 2008.\nHowever, he was exonerated in a departmental inquiry on merit before being reinstated.\nA District Court in Bagalkot dismissed the case against him in 2017 saying that investigation officers erred in estimating the value of assets and also other reasons. The High Court of Karnataka upheld this order in 2022."

He and others reportedly jumped into the sea and floated for several hours. Mr. Augustine and a few others were rescued by a team, but my husband and 10 others remain missing. We fear they may be in the custody of Houthi rebels,” Ms. Sheeja said.\nMr. Anilkumar had joined the shipping firm after retiring from the Indian Army, where he served for 19 years.

    "content": "An inter-state gang of three involved in a high-profile ATM theft in Jeedimetla earlier this month was arrested on Thursday, July 17. Police recovered ₹17 lakh in stolen cash and four motorcycles worth around ₹3 lakh from the trio.\nThe accused have been identified as Yasib Hussain alias Asif Haarun Khan, 28, a labourer from Palwal district, Haryana; Aamir Ansari, 24, a resident of Hyderabad; and Md. Abed, 31 from Nuh district, Haryana. They were arrested on Thursday by a joint team of CCS Balanagar and Jeedimetla law and order police.\nThe arrests come after a theft of ₹34.71 lakh from an HDFC ATM at Markhandeya Nagar, which was looted using gas cutters on the intervening nights of July 8 and 9.\nAccording to Jeedimetla police, the gang had a history of targeting ATMs across multiple states, relying on a methodical and well-rehearsed modus operandi. They conducted recces of ATM kiosks with external shutters, disabled CCTV surveillance, used gas cutters to breach machines, and escaped on stolen two-wheelers. In this case, they abandoned one such vehicle in Gummadidala and later stole another from Kamareddy before fleeing to Adilabad, where they again ditched the vehicles and split up, returning to their native States in trucks.\nThe investigation involved combing through footage from over 500 CCTV cameras to track the suspects’ movements. Technical and human intelligence eventually led to the identification and arrest of the accused.\nThe trio is currently booked in at least four criminal cases across Jeedimetla and Gummadidala police stations. They are also linked to over 30 past offences, including house burglaries, ATM break-ins, and vehicle thefts in various states.\nYasib Hussain has previously served a seven-year prison sentence for multiple charges under the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) in Kotwali police station of Madhya Pradesh, while Aamir Ansari, convicted for 20 years in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case, is currently out on bail."

    "content": "Kochi has been adjudged the cleanest city in Kerala under the ninth edition of the Swachh Survekshan survey 2024. At the national level, Kochi has significantly improved its position, rising from 416th place previously to 50th this year.\nThe latest survey was based on four key aspects. The first two focused on citizens’ feedback regarding the cleanliness of the city. The third aspect involved the assessment of waste treatment facilities, while the fourth was based on field inspections. Cleanliness, urban beautification, treatment of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, and wastewater management were among the various parameters considered during the inspection.\nA city from Kerala has entered the top 50 at the national level for the first time since the inception of Swachh Survekshan. “This is no small achievement, but there is still room for improvement. We must remain aware that 49 cities are ahead of us. Much work remains to be done to secure the top rank. We could make a significant leap once the compressed biogas (CBG) plant at Brahmapuram becomes operational,” said Mayor M. Anilkumar.\nThe Brahmapuram-centric waste treatment projects played a crucial role in helping Kochi surpass other cities in Kerala. The bio-mining of legacy waste at Brahmapuram is nearing completion. The existing 100-tonne capacity Black Soldier Fly plant, bottle booths established at various locations, resource recovery facility (RRF) plants, and container material collection facilities (MCF) are all exemplary models in waste treatment. The faecal sludge treatment plants at Wellingdon Island and Elamkulam, along with the organic waste composting plant at Manappattiparambu, were also inspected as part of the survey.\nThe Kochi Corporation has made notable progress in sanitation, waste management, and urban beautification. “We are confident that sustained efforts will help us elevate Kochi to the top of the list in the coming years,” said Mr. Anilkumar.\nHe expressed gratitude for the support of Local Self-Government Minister M.B. Rajesh, former Chief Secretary Sarada Muraleedharan, and former Corporation Secretary Babu Abdul Khadeer, as well as the guidance provided by the Kerala High Court, all of which contributed to the Corporation’s commendable achievement."

    "content": "Union Minister of Coal & Mines G. Kishan Reddy has urged Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy to partner with the Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) under his ministry, including Coal India Limited (CIL) and NLC India Limited (NLCIL), in taking up renewable energy projects, encompassing solar and wind power plants, Pumped Storage Projects (PSP) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS).\nIn an official communication to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media on Thursday, the Union Minister said these initiatives are projected to attract investments in the range of ₹10,000 crore to TG over the next three years.\nThe proposals are for development of solar power plants utilising Telangana’s high solar isolation zones, deployment of advanced BESS systems to enhance grid stability and energy reliability; pre-feasibility studies and implementation of PSPs to provide critical balancing capacity; and formation of joint venture models with State PSUs or on a standalone basis by the coal companies, to ensure faster project execution and maximize local economic benefits.\nAll these proposals and projects would require support in the acquisition or allocation of land by the State Government. They would be instrumental in the reduction of carbon emissions, improved air quality, and sustainable natural resource management, he said.\nMr. Kishan Reddy, also the Secunderabad MP, said that the proposals also offer substantial socio-economic dividends, including job creation, skill development, enhanced energy security, and affordable power access, driving inclusive growth and improved quality of life for all.\nTo take these projects to fruition, he has requested that a structured and seamless coordination be established between the State Government and the CPSUs. This can be done with the Chief Minister’s “active and timely engagement” and interventions in ensuring swift and effective implementation of these projects.\n“Your leadership in this matter can serve as a model for constructive Centre-State cooperation in building a greener and self-reliant future,” he said.\nTelangana’s substantial renewable energy potential and the Central Government’s unwavering commitment to green growth, offers an opportunity to accelerate the State’s economic development and position the State as a key contributor to India’s sustainable energy transition, he pointed out."

Ramachander, in Visakhapatnam on Thursday, urging the Commission to intervene and protect his two-acre of property in Raghunathapuram village of Tekkali mandal, Srikakulam district.\nJoint Action Committee of Scheduled Castes and Tribes of Srikakulam district co-convener Kantha Venu, Ambedkar India Mission State vice president Taekwondo Srinu, and representatives of various Dalit organisations briefed Mr. Ramachander about the injustice faced by Mr. Prakash. They claimed that many Dalit entrepreneurs in Srikakulam were being harassed by influential individuals who were attempting to grab lands belonging to those from marginalised communities.\nIn the memorandum, Mr. Prakash and others alleged that Tekkali Revenue Divisional Officer  M. Krishna Murthy was encouraging a few Tekkali residents including Lakkoji Gangarao, L. Keshava Rao, L. Sankara Rao and Y. Srinivasa Rao to create legal problems and project the site as a disputed property although it was bought by Mr. Prakash in 2023.\nAccording to them, Mr. Prakash obtained all valid documents from members and legal heirs of the Jagadhatri Displaced Goldsmiths RCC Spun Pipes Cooperative Society in 2023. The land comes under the survey numbers of 520/1 and 520/3 of the Tekkali mandal.\nMr. Prakash said: “The government is encouraging SC entrepreneurs across the State. Unfortunately, Tekkali revenue officials are causing mental agony despite the then Tekkali sub-collector and other officials having issued sale deed,adangaland conversion approvals after payment of the statutory fees to the government two years ago. No Dalit industrialist will come forward to set up industries if fake petitions are encouraged by the revenue department.”\nMr. Ramachander assured the delegation that the Commission would verify the veracity of the documents and investigate the issue in a few days."

Only 1,200 vehicles will be allowed per day in two sessions. The new system will come into effect within a week.\nChikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner Meena Nagaraj on Wednesday told the media that during the last six months, more than 2.5 lakh visitors travelled through the narrow lanes of the hill stations. The Geological Survey of India had also recommended restrictions on the number of vehicles at hill stations, keeping in mind the safety of the visitors.\nPeople residing in the villages around the hill stations, however, will not be a part of this system; instead, the administration will issue passes with a QR code to them. The number of tourist vehicles will be restricted to 600 in the morning, and another 600 in the afternoon. The 600 vehicles per session include 100 two-wheelers, 100 taxis (cars and jeeps), 50 tempo travellers, and another 350 private vehicles. The gate at Kaimara will be closed after the entry of the allowed number of vehicles.\nThe tourists will have three hours to spend at the hill stations.\n“All the vehicles will be stopped at Seethalayyanagiri. From there, the visitors can either walk or travel by the designated vehicles that has been allowed by the Tourism Department, which will also deploy two minibuses for the service,” the Deputy Commissioner said.\nThe district administration will also shift the shops located at the parking yard of Mullayyanagiri to Seethalayyanagiri. No new shop will be allowed in the area, the DC said.\nHundreds of vehicles visit the hill stations on holidays and weekends. Visitors often have a tough time negotiating the deep curves because of the heavy traffic. Environmentalists of Chikkamagaluru have been demanding restrictions on the number of vehicles for quite some time now."

    "content": "The Ahmedabad Crime Branch police have recovered the 150-year-old sacred ‘Panjtan Pak Kalash’, stolen from the Sarkhej Roza mausoleum, a nationally protected monument in the Gujarat capital. The police have arrested four persons for the theft, while four others are absconding.\nThe theft, reported at the Sarkhej police station on July 1, involved the disappearance of a Panjtan PakKalash— a religious urn made ofPanchdhatu(five metals) — from the dome of Sheikh Ahmad Khattu Ganj Bakhsh’s mausoleum, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Ajit Rajian.\nIt was installed on the dome of the mausoleum of Sheikh Ahmad Khattu Ganj Bakhsh — the spiritual mentor of Sultan Ahmad Shah, founder of Ahmedabad. The artefact is deeply revered in the Islamic faith and holds significant cultural and spiritual value for devotees, who tie threads ofmannat(faith) to it. Sarkhej Roza was built around 1445 CE.\n“Considering the religious and cultural sensitivity of the site, a special team of the Ahmedabad Crime Branch immediately initiated a thorough investigation and arrested four persons, while four more are at large,” Mr. Rajian said.\n‘Panjtan Pak’ refers to the five holy members of Prophet Muhammad’s family.\n“Architecturally, the site represents a 575-year-old Indo-Islamic masterpiece, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India since 1921. It is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List and played a pivotal role in Ahmedabad’s recognition as a World Heritage City in 2017,” Mr. Rajian said.\nThe police official said: “The probe included extensive CCTV footage review, aerial drone surveys of nearby lakes and remote areas, and the use of technical surveillance. We traced the accused to Kadi town in Mehsana district, where they were reportedly planning to sell the artefact.”\nThe four accused arrested were: Sureshbhai Dharmshibhai Dantani (40), a labourer from Chaprama, Kadi, Mehsana, originally from Peparana village in Harij taluka, Patan district; Gopalbhai Dharmshibhai Dantani (30), labourer, and younger brother of Sureshbhai, with the same residential details; Munnabhai Jayantibhai Dantani (23), labourer, also from Chaprama, with family roots in Chanasma, Patan; and Vishnubhai Chunabhai Dantani (22), labourer, resident of Rajvinagar, Jotana, Mehsana, originally from Shedhal, Chanasma, Patan.\nWhile those absconding are: Dinesh Dharmshibhai Dantani, resident of Chaprama, Kadi, Mehsana, native of Peparana, Patan; Kishorbhai Somabhai Dantani, resident of Mahemdabad, Kheda district; Jaliben Somabhai Dantani, resident of Chaprama, Kadi, Mehsana, a native of Peparana, Harij, Patan, and Dasu Dantani, a resident of Pendarpur, Chanasma, Patan."

    "content": "In an emotionalhomecoming, 29 tribal families, who had left their ancestral village of Mota Pippodra in Banaskantha’s Danta taluka 12 years ago due to a deep-rooted custom, were ceremoniously welcomed back on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nThese families, belonging to the Kodarvi community, had abandoned their native village on account of the tribal practice of Chadotaru — a traditional vendetta custom that had driven them into exile.\nThe emotional return of nearly 300 members of these families to their ancestral land was facilitated through a collaborative initiative involving the Banaskantha police, local administration, and community leaders. The event was marked by symbolic rituals, heartfelt gestures of reconciliation, and a firm governmental commitment to integrate these families back into the mainstream with dignity and support.\nAddressing the gathering, Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi called the occasion historic not just for Gujarat, but for tribal communities across India. “Today marks the eradication of an old social ill and a step towards progress, peace, and collective prosperity,” he said. He praised the elders of both communities for choosing dialogue over conflict and honoured them on stage for their role in restoring harmony. “Unity is the true identity of society, while hatred is a burden of darkness,” the Minister said.\nMr. Sanghavi welcomed the returning families withkumkum tilak, conducted traditional housewarming rituals (gruh pravesh), and later they sowed maize seeds in their fields to mark a new beginning. Each household was provided with educational kits, ration supplies, a wheelchair in the case of a differently-abled member, and certificates of appreciation for their courage and patience.\nThe Kodarvi families, who had scattered across Palanpur and Surat after fleeing Mota Pipada, were resettled on their legally owned 8.5-hectare land. The Banaskantha police, working with the District Inspector of Land Records, cleared and levelled the overgrown, desolate land to make it cultivable again, officials said.\nThey said that two houses had already been constructed, and under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, efforts were underway to provide permanent housing for all families. Partnerships with voluntary organisations were also being leveraged to provide essential infrastructure and livelihood support.\nMr. Sanghavi lauded the Banaskantha police for going beyond their security duties to help achieve lasting peace through community outreach. “This is an exemplary case of law enforcement leading social change,” the Minister said."

    "content": "Euthanasia of diseased and rabid stray dogs, as proposed by the State government, is unlikely to deliver the desired results considering the legal hurdles and the health risk involved in the process, according to veterinary experts.\nThe State government had on Wednesday permitted the local bodies to euthanise the rabid dogs by invoking the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Animal Husbandry Practices and Procedures) Rules 2023. As many as 3.17 lakh people sought treatment from government hospitals in the State in 2024 for dog bite-related cases. The first four months of the current year witnessed 16 rabies deaths and 1.31 lakh cases of dog bites, according to government data.\nThe Rules state that any diseased animal that can spread disease shall be put to death if a registered veterinary practitioner certifies that it is mortally or severely injured or in a physical condition that it would be cruel to keep it alive.\nEuthanasia, say the Rules, shall be done after blindfolding the animal. It shall be handled and controlled humanely to minimise its fear, pain and distress. The animal shall be sedated if it’s in an anxious state or fear or if there are concerns over the safety of the animal or the handler. It shall be put down by giving an overdose of anaesthetic to cause death, noted the Rule.\nHandling of rabid dogs as prescribed in the Rules could pose serious risks to the dog handlers and the veterinarians, who shall administer the drug to put the animal to death, pointed out V.K.P. Mohankumar, State general secretary of the Indian Veterinary Association, Kerala.\nThe government shall go for legislation to facilitate the legal euthanising of rabid dogs without much hassle. The practice of administering one dose of anti-rabies vaccine to street dogs suspected of having been bitten by rabid dogs is unscientific. Such dogs shall be given the full course of vaccine and kept under supervision for 120 days before releasing them. Intensive Animal Birth Control measures during the breeding period and not euthanasia can help in bringing down the canine population, he suggested.\nAny deviation from the Rules while euthanising the dogs could land the veterinarians in legal trouble. Moreover, administering drugs to put the dogs to death is a risky task as there exists a high possibility of the animal attacking humans, feared a senior government veterinarian.\nAggressive animals shall be kept in shelters and at least 150 ABC units shall be opened. Pet dogs, which are not kept for breeding shall be sterilised and their licensing made mandatory. Besides the reduction in dumping of waste, mobile surgery units and portable ABC units should be set up, the Association demanded."

Krishnankutty has pointed to lapses on the part of the management of the Thevalakkara Boys High School and the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) in connection with the electrocution of Class VIII student Midhun on Thursday.\nTalking to reporters, the Minister also announced an initial financial assistance of ₹5 lakh to Midhun’s family.\nCiting a preliminary report on the incident, Mr. Krishnankutty said the Electrical Inspectorate had found that adequate clearance was not maintained between the overhead power line and the ground. Necessary clearance also was not maintained between the line and the roof of the bicycle shed, atop which the boy came into contact with the live wire.\nHe said a detailed probe would be carried out into the incident by the Chief Safety Commissioner. The officer’s report is expected within one-and-a-half weeks.\nTerming the incident unfortunate, Mr. Krishnankutty said it is assumed that the boy was electrocuted while trying retrieve a slipper from the roof of the school’s bicycle shed. Mr. Krishnankutty said the school did not have permission to construct the bicycle shed.\nRegulations stipulate a clearance of 4.6 metres from the ground for bare, low-voltage conductors, Electrical Inspectorate officials said. In the school’s case, it was found to be only 4.28 metres. Also, constructions are generally prohibited under overhead lines. It was also found that at the school, the clearance from the roof of the shed to the line was a mere 0.88 metres, they said.\nAccording to Mr. Krishnankutty, the KSEB had on July 15 sought the approval of the school management to convert the overhead line into covered conductors and to install an electric post to prevent the distribution line from sagging. The school management had informed the KSEB that it would convey its decision after the next meeting of the school management committee.\nThe Minister said directives will be issued to the KSEB to inspect its overhead lines urgently and to adopt safety measures wherever necessary."

    "content": "Two doctors were assaulted at United Hospital in Mahabubnagar late on Monday, July 14, after the death of a reportedly terminally ill patient triggered violence within the premises. The incident has sparked outrage among the medical fraternity, with calls for immediate legal action and stronger protection mechanisms for healthcare workers.\nAccording to hospital authorities, the patient had been admitted in a critical condition with advanced cervical cancer and bilateral renal failure. She was also suffering from urinary retention and displayed extremely poor clinical indicators. Despite sustained efforts by the emergency medical team to stabilise her condition, the woman succumbed to her illness later that night. Hospital sources stated that her prognosis, complications, and medical limitations had been clearly communicated to the family beforehand.\nTensions flared when the news of her death was formally conveyed. A mob soon gathered at the hospital and turned violent, attacking staff and destroying property. Amith Mankal, one of the attending doctors, was physically assaulted during the chaos. His shirt was torn and his mobile phone, which contained video recordings of counselling sessions with the patient’s family, was snatched. Hospital records, including case sheets and consent forms, were damaged in the violence.\nRammohan, President of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Palamuru and Vice President of IMA Telangana, was also targeted during the attack. According to IMA members, he was beaten with footwear in full view of hospital staff and bystanders. The hospital management has lodged a formal police complaint, and an investigation is currently underway.\nCondemning the assault, the IMA Palamuru chapter has demanded legal action against those involved. The association has called for the attackers to be booked under the Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, a special law meant to deter violence against healthcare workers. It has also urged the State government to ensure proper security measures at both public and private hospitals.\nOn July 16, a delegation from IMA Telangana visited Mahabubnagar to attend Praja Charcha Sabha Vedika, a public forum hosted by the local chapter. Addressing the gathering, IMA Telangana President Dwarkanath Reddy described the incident as a grim reminder of the vulnerability faced by doctors today. “There are many reasons why a patient dies, especially in terminal cases. Doctors work under immense pressure and with limited options. No doctor treats a patient with the intention of causing harm. This violence should serve as a wake-up call to society. Those responsible must be held accountable,” he said.\nV. Ashok, General Secretary of IMA Telangana, appealed to the public to seek redress through legal means rather than resort to violence. “We are not above accountability. If anyone feels medical care was inadequate, there are courts, there are legal forums. But don’t raise your hand against us,” he said."

According to Revenue department officials, 2,100 people possessed thandaper documents in the two villages. “Among these, 645 people hold 10 cents of land, and nearly 25 people hold over five acres of land,” said a department official.\n“The Revenue department will consider issuing title deeds to those who hold 10 cents of land in these areas. If the land is not suitable for constructing houses, we will provide them another plot. However, action will be taken against those who hold land in these survey numbers without valid documents,” said the Collector.\nEarlier, the Collector had appointed the Revenue department special team, headed by the Idukki Subcollector, to investigate the land grab on the Parunthumpara hills. The special team has issued notices to over 1,475 people in both the survey areas, asking to produce their documents. “The document verification process is going on,” said a Revenue department official.\nThe Revenue department officials said they are planning to complete the document verification process within three months.\nA special investigation team (SIT) headed by K. Sethuraman, former Director, Police Training College, had found large-scale land encroachments and illegal constructions on the government lands in Parunthumpara. The SIT had submitted a 774-page report to the government and the Kerala High Court on this."

In the petition, Mr. Shiyas sought action against Mr. Vijayan for making a speech ‘abetting violence’ while referring to agitating Youth Congress activists reportedly coming under attack, mainly from alleged Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists during the Nava Kerala Yatra led by Mr. Vijayan in November 2023.\nIn his petition, Mr. Vijayan had sought a stay on all further proceedings before the CJM Court, pending disposal of the case. In its order issued on Thursday, a Single Bench of Justice V.G. Arun said that there appeared to be prima facie substance in the contention of the counsel of Mr. Vijayan that the CJM exceeded his jurisdiction by entertaining the complaint, since the alleged incident (of violence against the protesters) took place outside the territorial limits of the court.\nThe contention that the contents of the speech does not attract the offence under Section 109 (that states the punishment for abetment) of the Indian Penal Code is also liable to be considered. Hence, the interim stay on further proceedings for three months in the petition that is pending before the CJM Court, the court added. The case has been posted for hearing on October 14."

    "content": "The BJP has accused the Congress Government of sowing the seeds of doubt into the minds of farmers in Telangana about the purported shortage of urea for the Rabi season, even when the Centre had actually supplied three lakh metric tonnes more.\nAddressing the farmers’ wing (Kisan Morcha) of the party, during a meeting of its office-bearers at the State BJP office here on Thursday, party president N. Ramchander Rao said that the ‘urea shortage bogey’ is being created by the ruling party only to reap the benefit during the forthcoming local body polls.\nThe BJP chief charged the government with spreading falsehoods when the Centre had supplied 12.02 lakh metric tonnes of urea for the 24-25 agriculture season, when the demand was just 9.5 lakh metric tonnes. In fact, under the Modi Government, necessary steps were taken to provide ample supply of fertilizers to farmers across the country and also in dealing with black marketers with an iron hand, unlike the UPA regime “where farmers were forced to stand in queues for obtaining it”, he added.\nYet, the Congress Government here wants to mislead farmers and to cover up its own failures in not ensuring proper payment of Rythu Bharosa, which has been cut from the promised ₹15,000 during the elections to ₹12,000, but now ₹6,000 is being credited into farmers’ accounts, he said.\nMr. Ramchander Rao also said that the farmers’ welfare scheme payment was made last month only after the High Court had directed the local body polls to be held by September end. It has been 19 months since the Government has come to power but there has been no movement to provide the farm insurance which would help the famers during natural calamities under the PM Fasal Bima Yojana and following the BRS Government in this connection, he said.\nThe former MLC also questioned the government about the Bhu Bharati module replacing the controversial Dharani of BRS regime and said it is marked with technical glitches. “Farmers are forced to run around registration offices for justice still and there is a lack of accountability from the administration side. We should go to the local level and highlight farmers’ grievances,” he advised the wing.\nThe BJP leader said such is the sad financial condition in the State that retired employees are being denied benefits and made to run from pillar to post. General secretary G. Premender Reddy, farmers’ wing national executive member G. Madhusudhan Reddy and others were present.\nMr. Ramchander Rao will tour Medak district and participate in various programmes, organised by the BJP, in Narsapur, Chegonta, Medak, and Toopran, on Friday, said a press release."

The government will constitute a district-level purchase committee (DLPC) in every district for this purpose. The District Collector will verify the title, non encumbrance certificate, basic tax receipt, building tax receipt, possession certificate, and other relevant records.\nAfter categorisation of lands, the committee will arrive at the basic value of the land. Price escalation up to 50% over the basic value of land will be allowed. Any increase beyond the basic value of land negotiated and agreed by the purchase committee will be based on specific merit and sound reasoning to be recorded in writing."

Sathyanarayanan, Secretary, Kumbakonam All Traders Association.\nThe line could provide connectivity to Gangaikonda Cholapuram, where the famous Brihadisvara Temple built by King Rajendra Chola I is situated. With the Prime Minister scheduled to visit Gangaikonda Cholapuram later this month, it would be apt for the Railway Ministry to announce new rail line now, Mr. Sathyanarayanan said.\nKumbakonam is an important spiritual, commercial, and historic city in Tamil Nadu. It is located in the single line section between Thanjavur and Villupuram on the 147-year-old Main Line section of Southern Railway. The Mahamaham festival, popularly known as the Kumbh of the South, is celebrated here once every 12 years.\nThe city attracts continuous flow of pilgrims from different parts of the country through the year as it is also the hub for visiting the Navagraha temples. Yet Kumbakonam is neglected in terms of traffic and development as it has not been upgraded as a junction, he regretted.\nThe demand for this new line had been in existence for over 50 years ago and a question in this regard had been raised even in Parliament in 1955, said A. Giri, secretary, Thanjavur District Railway Users Association. Considering the repeated demand, a preliminary survey was conducted for a new line between Kumbakonam and Vriddachalam in June 2016.  The project is awaiting approval ever since, he said.\nThe new line between Needamangalam and Vriddhachallam via Kumbakonam will provide an alternative shorter route to Salem, Bengaluru, Tirupati and other destinations from Rameswaram and southern Tamil Nadu via Pattukottai and Mannargudi.\nIt would ensure speedy movement of freight traffic from Karaikal Port and boost spiritual tourism as it would connect places such as Kumbakonam and Gangaikonda Cholapuram. By providing train connectivity to under developed places such as Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Jayamkondam, and Andimadam, it would boost economic growth in the region, Mr. Giri added."

The chunk of dental practitioners is in the private sector in urban areas, making dental care services inaccessible and unaffordable to most.\nWhen even States like Haryana, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, whose public health systems are ranked lower than that of Kerala, provide dental care services right from primary health centres, primary and preventive oral health care through public health centres (PHCs) is yet to happen in the State\nWhen community health centres (CHCs) were standardised as part of the Aardram Mission in 2021, it was specified that there should be at least one dental surgeon in every CHC. Yet, just 42 out of the 257 CHCs in the State currently have dental surgeons. Most of the dental OPDs in taluk hospitals and CHCs are single doctor clinics, where dental surgeons struggle to manage the outpatient load as well as handle various treatment procedures\n“The State needs to prioritise the provision of dental care services to people. We do not even have baseline public health data regarding the burden of oral diseases. Increasing incidence of oral cancers, that too in non- tobacco users, points towards poor oral health care at the primary prevention and care level,” a dental surgeon pointed out.\nA comparison of the cost of various dental procedures in the private sector and in the public sector can leave one staggering because the cost difference is ten fold.\nA root canal treatment at a taluk hospital would be charged ₹200, whereas the same could be anywhere from ₹3,000 to ₹6,000 or more in the private sector. A complete denture for an elderly person is approximately ₹520 in the public sector. In the private sector, it ranges from ₹18,000 to ₹25,000. A tooth extraction is just ₹30 at a CHC but will be charged from ₹500-1,000 in a private clinic. Composite fillings or tooth-coloured fillings are more aesthetically pleasing for repairing cavities or chipped tooth . This is charged around ₹150 in the public sector. The same will cost around ₹1,800-2,400 in the private sector.\nThe high cost of care for various essential dental procedures in the private sector and the woeful inadequacy of dental care services in the periphery have been driving the general public to government dental college hospitals in the State, where treatment costs are nil.\nThis has led to problems of overcrowding in all government hospitals in the State, which are bogged down by huge waiting lists of patients from the periphery, requiring essential dental procedures like root canal treatment, fixed orthodontic treatment and prosthodontic treatments.\n“The minimum waiting time for a root canal treatment (which is one procedure most in demand) is six months. Timely treatment is crucial for oral health and this will remain elusive to the poor unless better dental services are made available in the periphery,” a faculty member at the Government Dental College here said\n“At present, despite the huge demand for dental care services and the increasing number of BDS students graduating every year, the Health Services has just 135 posts of Assistant Dental Surgeons. Not a single new post has been created in the last nine years,” he added\nThe last Kerala PSC examination for Assistant Dental Surgeons was held in  November 2020 and it was written by  9,161 candidates. The rank list published on August 29, 2022 had just 156 candidates but only 16 persons got appointed. There are currently no vacancies.\nHowever, a proposal to create 130 new posts of Assistant Dental Surgeons in Health Services has been hanging fire with the Health department since 2018. With the current PSC list expiring next month, the existing job aspirants on the list are looking to the government to take a favourable decision regarding post creation\nThe community of dental surgeons in the State are quite worried about the surplus workforce, job insecurities amongst their tribe and the meagre pay scales in the government sector. They hope that the demand for affordable dental services will not be ignored."

Following the incident, the residents of Koppa took out protests, and officers concerned were suspended.\nThe PSIs, as part of the initiative, gave surprise visits to various hostels and residential schools across the district on July 14 and 15. During the visits, they interacted with the students, teaching, and non-teaching staff. They spread awareness of the laws that ensure the safety of the girl children and the measures they need to take for their safety.\nThe officers also reviewed if the administration had installed CCTV cameras at common areas and the appointment of security guards and also enquired if students faced any inconvenience from outsiders. The hostel staff had been instructed to put up posters informing the students of emergency helplines, including the police control room."

A private firm has been given the contract for ₹12,217 crore and the machinery required for the process has been moved to the dump yard. Nearly 1,68,285 metric tonnes of fertiliser would be generated.\nThe MLA would also lay foundation for laying of drainage lines and roads at a cost of ₹1.70 crore in different wards of the Anantapur city."

    "content": "The inclusion of Mysuru in the ‘Super Swachh League’ of clean cities has baffled citizens including NGOs who want a reality check at the ground level before the local authorities bask in the new glory.\nWhile Mysuru is historically known to be a planned and clean city - and was rated among the cleanest in the country in the first few editions of Swachh Survekshan – its performance has continuously declined since then. Last year, it was a dismal 27th rank in the country and raised a furore among the stakeholders.\nB.S.Prashanth of Federation of Organisation and Associations of Mysuru, said that categorising Mysuru among the cleanest cities is a welcome news. “But we the citizens demand more from the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) and find it not pro-active enough,” he said.\nThough parts of the city appear clean, the filth and uncleared garbage greets public including tourists and hence both the MCC Commissioner and the Health Officer should be more pro-active on this issue, said Mr. Prashanth.\nHe urged the authorities to convene meeting with stakeholders like those in the tourism sector, hospitality sector, etc., and elicit their views on issues related to Mysuru. However, Mr. Prashanth said that MCC was stretched to its limits due to paucity of staff strength and the growing demands of the city.\nR. Chandra Prakash, an academician who was with the Institute of Development Studies, University of Mysore, and articulates on issues related to the city, said that the ranking is a welcome development but should not lull the authorities into complacency. “The award should not lead us to slumber as it happened in the past when Mysuru slid from 1st rank to 27th rank,” he added.\nThere is a general perception that not withstanding the relative cleanliness of the city, there were issues like uncleared garbage in most residential areas apart from disposal of construction waste. Encroachment of footpaths by hawkers and street food vendors is going on unabated and the MCC has been unable to find a solution.\nThe NGOs have also urged the MCC to impose stiff penalty on people littering public places and throwing garbage, so as to check the menace. The stakeholders also want the local authorities to make it a habit to keep the city clean 24x7 and not during Swachh Survekshan alone."

Over 2,000 illegal outlets were sealed, and more than 500 institutions were found operating without sewage treatment plants.\nSeventy such erring units were shut down for violating environmental norms, according to an action taken report filed by the Chief Secretary of Kerala before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal on July 15, 2025, in the case related to the pollution of the waterbodies.\nA total of 12,199 inspections were conducted between March 2023 and May 2025 to check for violations. Of the ₹69.23 lakh in fines imposed, only ₹12.24 lakh has been collected so far. A total of 556 units were found lacking sewage treatment plants, and nearly 194 plants were found non-functional.\nThe report said that 878 pre-monsoon cleaning drives were conducted over the past two years. More than 900 public spaces were cleaned, and around 385 tonnes of waste were removed. Around 1,281 km of canals and drains were cleared during this period.\nA three-tier monitoring system comprising local-level vigilance squads and district- and block-level enforcement squads has been set up as part of the remedial measures against pollution. Nine major community-level projects were under implementation in the districts through which the lakes traversed, aimed at preventing illegal discharge.\nThe focus has been on treating faecal sludge and septage, commissioning sewage treatment plants, and supporting the necessary infrastructure. According to the report, local bodies have initiated steps to set up bio-digesters, greywater treatment systems, and soak pits to curb the illegal sewage inflow from houseboats, residential and commercial establishments, and institutions."

    "content": "The State Horticulture and Sericulture Department is set to recruit 175 new Horticulture Extension Officers on an outsourcing basis, following the issuance of an order by the State government on Thursday. As per the order, these officers will work under the administrative control of the Director of Horticulture, Hyderabad, for a period up to March 31, 2026, or till the regular posts are filled up or till the actual need ceases, whichever is earlier. They will receive a monthly remuneration of ₹22,750.\nHowever, the Telangana State Horticulture Officers Association (TGHO) has raised objections to the government’s decision, citing concerns that many of these officers to be recruited, who had worked under the Micro Irrigation Programme (MIP) till 2020, lack the necessary qualifications, such as a Diploma or Degree in horticulture.\n“It is not right to continue their services again as they do not possess a Diploma or Bachelor’s Degree in horticulture. If eligible candidates are given the posts, farmers can receive advice in a scientific manner,” said an office-bearer of the TGHO, adding that they are requesting the government to appoint qualified officers.\nThe TGHO has demanded that the government sanction new Horticulture Extension Officer positions on a regular basis, similar to the Agriculture department. They also want the number of existing horticultural officers to be doubled to ensure adequate coverage.\nThe current staff strength in the Horticulture Department has remained unchanged since its sanction in 1982, despite the vast potential for growth in vegetable, fruit, and palm oil cultivation. Each Horticulture Officer currently has to travel to 5-10 mandals, and only 100 personnel are working at the field level across the State.\nWhen contacted over phone, Director of Horticulture Department Shaik Yasmeen Basha said that the department would provide required training to the proposed Horticulture Extension Officers before sending them to the field. She also mentioned that employees who had worked with the MIP had been requesting the government for postings."

The authorities believed the residents were using the delay as a pressure tactic to push their demands. Nearly 200 metres of cable went up in flames, generating thick fumes and a pungent smell that left many residents dizzy on the evening of July 8.\n“The meeting at the Chief Secretary level will be arranged by next week. Once a decision is reached, the families may agree to return to their homes,” said District Collector N.S.K. Umesh.\nThe day after the fire broke out, the District Collector convened a meeting and appointed two separate committees. One of the committees, led by K. Manoj, Deputy Collector (Disaster Management), and comprising the BPCL-KR security officer, electrical inspector, and KSEBL officials, has been tasked with investigating the cause of the fire. “That study is under way, and a report is expected within a week,” said the Collector.\nA separate committee comprising the Pollution Control Board (PCB) engineer, grama panchayat health inspector, village officer, and company representatives had already visited the households in Ayyankuzhi to assess their suitability for habitation. The committee collected air samples from the area and is awaiting the analytical results. However, a previous study conducted by the PCB had already categorised the neighbourhood as a ‘red zone’ unfit for living.\n“We will not return to our homes unless a final decision is made on the acquisition of our land. There is no guarantee that an even more dangerous fire incident will not occur, given the highly inflammable piped gas and chemicals passing through the neighbourhood,” said Saji Kumar, convener of the Ayyankuzhi Janakeeya Samithi.\nMeanwhile, a medical camp was held two days ago to assess the health of the families, and a report has been submitted to the District Medical Officer, who could not be reached for comment."

Around 60 elephants participated in the ritual, including seven brought in from the Guruvayur Devaswom.\nAs part of the offering, the elephants were fed large rice balls, which contained a carefully prepared Ayurvedic mix in it. The feast also included sugarcane, watermelon, jackfruit, bananas, and cucumber, specially selected for the well-being of the animals.\nThe homam prasadam was prepared using an impressive array of ingredients, including 12,008 coconuts, 2,500 kg of jaggery, 200 kg of ghee, 1,000 kg of flattened rice, 100 kg of puffed rice, honey, and Ganapathi lemons, making it one of the most grand and spiritually charged offerings of the season.\nThe Vadakkunnathan temple Aanayoottu is more than a visual spectacle—it is a blend of devotion, tradition, and reverence for elephants."

    "content": "Crime hot spots within the Kochi City police limits are set to come under round-the-clock surveillance, with at least 150 CCTV cameras to be installed within the next three months.\nThe cameras, connected to a centralised control room in Thevara, will receive live footage. The installation of cameras for the Kochi City police marks the second phase of the project, under which Thalassery-based Southern Electronics and Security Systems has agreed to install 300 CCTV cameras — 150 for the Kochi Corporation to track and penalise illegal waste dumping, and 150 for the Kochi City police to monitor crime.\nThe company has already installed 120 of the 150 cameras meant for the Corporation, with a minimum of two cameras proposed in each of the 74 divisions. “Cameras are being installed in areas identified as waste dumping hot spots and are connected to a centralised control room set up at the Corporation’s Yatri Nivas. In return, the company will be allowed to generate revenue by advertising on Cochin Smart Mission Limited [CSML] poles,” said T.K. Asharaf, health standing committee chairperson. The project will be inaugurated shortly.\nPradeep Kumar, managing director, Southern Electronics and Security Systems, said the company would be responsible for the maintenance of the cameras and the operation of the control room for seven years, as per the project being implemented under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model. “The remaining 30 cameras will be installed shortly. We have already set up the control room, which is equipped with six 55-inch monitors and manned by two persons in three shifts,” he added.\nAction is already being taken based on CCTV camera footage. Where vehicles are involved, the Motor Vehicles department is contacted to collect the owner’s address, which is then passed on to the health inspectors and the councillors concerned.\nThe company, he said, will be allowed to advertise on 600 CSML poles. However, Mr. Asharaf put the total number at 400, with advertising on the first lot of 200 poles to be permitted once the commitment of installing 150 cameras for the Corporation is fulfilled, and the rest upon the completion of camera installation for the Kochi City police.\nSenior Congress councillor Antony Kureethara said that the number of poles permitted for advertising should be restricted, especially in the wake of the High Court’s direction against the disfiguring of public spaces. “Two cameras in a division will be inadequate since the number of waste dumping hot spots has gone up. Ideally, the Corporation should have directly implemented the project with better coverage, considering how much funds are otherwise being wasted. Also, rather than a centralised control room, it would have been more efficient if the CCTV cameras were monitored across the seven Corporation zones,” he added."

    "content": "Dissatisfied over the ‘unilateral’ statements made by both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on the Banakacherla issue, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Bandi Sanjay Kumar said that the Centre took on the role of a facilitator to help resolve the long-standing water disputes between the two states amicably.\nSpeaking to the media after distributing bicycles to Class 10 students of government schools in Huzurabad town on Thursday, Mr. Sanjay said, “The Centre organised a meeting with CMs of both States with the sole intention of achieving a peaceful resolution to the long-standing water disputes.”\nIn reality, both the Chief Ministers had gone to the meeting with separate and individual agendas. For the Centre, both States are equal, he said, and noted that the Centre formed the expert committee to look into the listed issues to ensure justice to both.\nTerming the BRS party’s allegations over the issue as politically motivated, he accused the previous BRS rulers of colluding with the then Andhra Pradesh government and mortgaging Telangana’s share of Krishna waters. The current government seems to be following the same path, he charged.\nHe reiterated that the BJP will not accept any move to provide 10% reservations to Muslims from within the 42% quota for Backward Classes. “We will convince the Centre so that full 42% quota is exclusively earmarked for BCs,” he noted.\nHe said the corruption among the errant irrigation officials associated with the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) is shocking. Crores of rupees have been uncovered in ACB raids, he pointed out, saying the ‘inflated estimates’ of the project show how the previous BRS rulers indulged in ‘massive corruption’.\nThe Union Minister said he had received a notice from the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the phone-tapping case to appear before it as a witness on July 24. “I will submit all the facts I know before the SIT,” he added."

    "content": "The Union Government has approved a ₹7,000-crore investment by NLC India Limited (NLCIL) into its renewable energy arm, NLC India Renewables Limited (NIRL).\nAccording to an NLCIL press note, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister has granted an exemption from the existing guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), empowering NLCIL to invest in NIRL, and to enable NIRL to invest in projects independently or through joint ventures.\nThis significant decision exempts NLCIL and NIRL from the 30% net worth ceiling imposed on Central Public Sector Enterprises for investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures (JVs), ensuring enhanced operational autonomy and financial agility. The move is poised to catalyse NLCIL’s growth in the renewable energy sector, aligning with India’s national energy transition goals.\nNLCIL operates a renewable energy portfolio of 1.4 GW. These assets will be transferred to NIRL to consolidate green energy initiatives under a unified platform.\nWith this strategic support, NLCIL plans to scale its renewable energy capacity from the current 1.4 GW to 10 GW by 2030, contributing significantly to India’s commitment of installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, as declared at COP 26 under the ‘‘Panchamrit” strategy.\nThe long-term vision of NLCIL includes expanding this capacity to 32 GW by 2047, in alignment with the nation’s goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070.\nNLCIL said the approval would help the company strengthen India’s global position in green energy leadership; reduce India’s coal imports and carbon footprint; ensure reliable 24x7 power supply through clean sources; generate large-scale direct and indirect employment, and promote inclusive socio-economic development in project regions.\nAccording to NLCIL Chairman and Managing Director Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, “The support extended by the Government of India through this exemption is a game changer for NLCIL’s renewable energy roadmap. It reaffirms our commitment to building a sustainable future and scaling up green energy infrastructure. The company is now well-positioned to invest in cutting-edge technologies and forge strategic collaborations that will help us realise our goals.”"

A war room was opened three months ago, and the staff at the room received over 2,500 complaints from different places. “We have reports that there are many illegal migrants from Bangladesh settled in Bengaluru, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, and Vijayapura districts. They have got fake Aadhar cards. Because of them, the local plantation workers are suffering without job,” he said.\nThe former Minister said that he would share the information collected from local people with the State and Central governments. “The police have ample information about the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They need to act immediately. The Election Commission (EC) has said that many illegal immigrants have enrolled their names in the voters’ list in Bihar. The EC may conduct a drive to revise the voters’ list in Karnataka too in the coming days,” he said.\nFormer Minister Kumar Bangarappa, who was also part of the team, stated that the Aadhar card should be linked to the family tree of every individual. “If the family tree is linked to the Aadhar card, it will be easy to trace every individual’s background. We will place this demand before the Central government,” he added.\nBJP MLA B.P. Harish, party leader N.R. Santosh, and others were present. The team visited coffee estates and interacted with planters and plantation workers."

Chinnaswamy stadium, it was argued before the High Court of Karnataka, on behalf of senior IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash.\nEarlier, it was contended on behalf of the State government that some police officers acted like “servants” of RCB and “embarrassed” the government due to the death of 11 persons in the stampede that occurred outside the stadium on June 4.\nThese submissions were made before a division bench comprising Justice S.G. Pandit and Justice T.M. Nadaf during an appeal filed by the State government, which had questioned the Central Administrative Tribunal’s July 1 verdict of quashing the government’s June 5 order of suspending Mr. Vikash Kumar, who was holding the post of Additional Commissioner of Police (West) on the day of stampede.\nSenior Advocate P.S. Rajgopal, appearing for the government, argued that the police officers made some security arrangements without first asking who had authorised the public event.\nPointing out that the senior police officer have the power under Section 35 of the Karnataka Police Act to “prohibit certain acts for prevention of disorder” Mr. Rajgopal contended that they failed to exercise this power and Mr. Kumar, who was allegedly aware of the request made by the Karnataka State Cricket Association on victory celebrations to the station house officer of Cubbon Park police station, had failed to take proper measure.\nSenior advocate Dhyan Chinnappa, appearing for Mr. Vikash Kumar, contended that the senior police officers were made “scapegoats” as suspension was not based on any material against the police officers but to fix “accountability” to someone.\nThough the order of suspension refers to dereliction of duty, the government has made it clear in its status report submitted to the High Court that it took action (of suspension) against senior police officers “recognising the need for accountability within the law enforcement hierarchy.” Mr. Chinnappa pointed out.\nIt was also pointed out that an IPS officer cannot be suspended on the charges of dereliction of duty, sans following procedure, which in the case of Mr. Vikash Kumar has not been followed, argued Mr. Chinnappa. The arguments will continue on Friday."

As per the agreement, a part of the revenue generated from tourism will be utilised for the upkeep of the fields, especially to repair bunds damaged by country boat movement and to strengthen the outer embankments of the paddy fields.\n“To ensure organised and equitable operations, designated landing points will be set up in each padasekharam in coordination with the respective farmer committees. Country boats will operate on a rotational basis, allowing fair participation of all operators. Strict safety protocols, including mandatory use of life jackets, will be in place. All country boats will be registered and the destination will function as a model for responsible tourism,” said K. Anil Kumar, convener of the Meenachil-Meenanthara-Kodoor river relinking programme.\nWith Malarikkal now officially recognised as a tourism zone, traffic management has become a key focus. Visitors will be required to park their vehicles near Kanjiram Palam and proceed to Malarikkal Junction. Parking has been made compulsory and additional private parking areas have been set up,  which are accessible for a fee.\nTo preserve the natural charm and orderliness of the area, no temporary or permanent commercial establishments will be allowed along the newly widened tourism road. Unauthorised stalls and structures will be removed by the Public Works department.

ICFRE is an apex body under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, which undertakes forestry research, education, and extension activities at the national level through its regional research institutes located in different parts of the country.\nSanjay Sood, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Himachal Pradesh, said the ICFRE and HFRI have recently completed three research projects regarding “fodder bank, poplar, and wild edible fruits” that are vital from the point of view of the State of Himachal Pradesh.\n“Since fodder is a very important component for the cattle, the establishment of a fodder bank can play an important role in the animal husbandry sector. Similarly, conservation and cultivation of wild edible fruit trees can also be useful in tackling the problem of monkey menace prevalent in Himachal Pradesh and addressing the problem of human-animal conflict. Poplars are useful for their rapid growth, timber production and environmental benefits, are used in agroforestry, provide wood for various industries, and play a vital role in carbon sequestration and soil stabilisation,” he said, inaugurating the workshop.\nMr. Sood said he was optimistic that the outcome of these research projects would prove useful to the stakeholders as well as policymakers in formulating policies for the future."

Tyagaraja saying that it is false and baseless.\nProf. Tyagaraja has been leading the university towards progress. His future vision and tireless efforts have significantly contributed to the academic and infrastructure development in the university, it said.\nHowever, some vested interests have been making false allegation against him. It is baseless and far from truth. We condemn such efforts to malign an academic’s reputation, it said.\nAssociation president J. Manjanna said that the allegation was made by those who cannot tolerate the Vice-Chancellor’s achievements.\n“There appears to be a hidden conspiracy behind the allegation aimed at tarnishing the university’s reputation. However, the accusation has no substance when verified with the documents available in the university. The Vice-Chancellor has been working tirelessly for the progress of the university. He is introducing innovative ideas for qualitative education and the university’s overall development is advancing through several progressive initiatives,” he said.\n“Under the PM-USHA MERU scheme, with a grant of ₹100 crore, a process is under way to procure state-of-the-art equipment for the university’s central laboratories and a few buildings on the new campus. The university has distributed laptops to all Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes students, reflecting its commitment to supporting students education and employment. All these are due to the Vice-Chancellor’s efforts,: he said.\n“The Vice-Chancellor is facilitating interaction of students with accomplished individuals from diverse fields by organizing special programmes. Some faculty members have taken up collaborative research works with prestigious universities in foreign countries. Some have published articles. Resource persons have delivered lectures to students and faculty. The university is preparing to shift to a new campus,” he said.\n“It is important that administrative functioning continues smoothly without distractions. Therefore, the teachers association strongly condemns the baseless allegation against the Vice-Chancellor,” the letter said.\nThe Dalit Vidyarthi Parishat staged a protest against the Vice-Chancellor in Vijayapura recently saying that he has fudged records to claim false academic achievements.\nHe has obtained voluntary retirement from the university before seeking appointment as Vice-Chancellor. His academic degrees are questionable. His work experience does not make him eligible for appointment as Vice-Chancellor, the parishat said during the protest.\nDalit Vidyarthi Parishat State president Srinath Pujari said that he has obtained some documents through RTI, to support his allegation. He said that he has written a letter to the Governor seeking action against the Vice-Chancellor.\nProf. Tyagaraj, however, is yet to respond to the allegation."

Further, a few have raised concerns that law and order issues have been surfacing due to “indiscriminate drinking on the streets.”\n“Hence, the State government is considering allowing the consumers to have the drink at the shop itself and go home,” the sources say.\nThe government did not allow permit rooms in the initial liquor policy introduced last year. But, based on the latest developments, the Excise Department is making certain amendments to the policy to allow permit rooms.\n“The permit rooms are intended only for the purpose of having alcohol. But licensed liquor shops are not allowed to serve food. Serving food, along with the liquor, is allowed only at licensed bar and restaurants only,” the sources maintain."

    "content": "The Telangana Excise and Prohibition Department has proposed shutting down all toddy shops operating within the limits of the Outer Ring Road (ORR), in a bid to crack down on the sale ofadulterated toddy.\nThe government is actively considering the proposal and has sought a detailed report from the Excise Department, according to informed sources.\nThe move comes after theKukatpally adulterated toddy incidentthat claimed at least ten lives and left over 50 individuals hospitalised. The case has led to mounting concern over the increasing use of banned substances  including alprazolam, chloral hydrate and other chemicals in toddy.\nSharing the rationale behind the move, a source close to the development, said that the Kukatpally incident not only triggered public outrage but also drew parallels to a similar episode in 2004, which led then Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to shut down toddy shops in Hyderabad and Secunderabad.\nAccording to data compiled by the Excise Department, a total of 454 toddy shops operate within ORR limits, functioning under 390 cooperative societies. These include 53 shops in Hyderabad, 50 in Secunderabad, 79 in Malkajgiri of Rangareddy district, 52 in Medchal, 158 in Saroornagar and 62 in Shamshabad.\nIf the ban is implemented, it would impact toddy sales across major urban zones including Hyderabad, Secunderabad and parts of Rangareddy, particularly under the excise divisions of Malkajgiri, Medchal, Shadnagar and Saroornagar.\nAdditionally, the government is likely to cancel Tree For Trade (TFT) toddy concessions (licensing of toddy shops to individual tappers or Tappers’ Cooperative Societies) in these areas as part of the broader crackdown.\nAuthorities maintain that removing toddy outlets from the ORR region is the only effective way to prevent the distribution of adulterated toddy in urban areas. The State government is expected to make a final decision on the proposal in the coming weeks."

    "content": "Over a decade after many patients were administered expired Hepatitis-B vaccines at government-run Gandhi Hospital, the Telangana Human Rights Commission (THRC) has ordered the State government to pay ₹1.25 lakh in compensation to each of the victims.\nThe Commission, in its order dated July 4, also called for strict action against hospital authorities and a complete overhaul of medicine procurement and verification protocols in government hospitals.\nThe incident, which came to light through complaints filed in 2014 and 2015, involved 16 individuals who suffered adverse effects after being given expired vaccines at the hospital’s Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre of Excellence.\nThe complainants alleged that Dr. V. Tara Devi, a Research Fellow at the centre, administered the vaccines despite their expiry, leading to dizziness, stomach pain, drowsiness, and significant mental distress.\nThe THRC also took suo motu cognisance of a newspaper report published in 2015, which revealed irregularities in the hospital’s medicine supply system. Its investigation found that the vaccines were indeed expired, and that the packaging displayed two conflicting expiry dates, one for the vaccine and another for the syringe. While hospital authorities claimed the administration was unintentional and blamed the manufacturer for the unclear labelling, the Commission rejected the explanation, holding the hospital accountable for failing in its basic and non-negotiable duty to verify expiry dates before drug administration.\nThe Commission found the hospital superintendent’s report defending the act to be motivated by a desire to shield the hospital staff. It also dismissed the claim that the expired vaccines had low potency and were therefore harmless, calling it medically unfounded.\nJustice Shameem Akther, Chairperson of the THRC, held that the victims’ fundamental rights to health, dignity, and bodily integrity were violated. He noted that although Dr. Tara Devi had been suspended, disciplinary action alone was not sufficient to address the seriousness of the breach.\nThe Commission directed the Chief Secretary of Telangana to initiate proceedings against all responsible officials, including the hospital’s Superintendent and supervising staff. It further asked the government to ensure that expired or nearly expired drugs are not accepted at any government-run healthcare facility. Suppliers must be made to print clear and prominent expiry dates on both the outer wrapper and internal containers of all medical supplies. The State government has been given two months from the date of the order to implement the recommendations in full."

    "content": "The State government told the High Court of Karnataka that “it did not stop the RCB’s victory celebrations” at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium even though permission was not granted for the event, “as abruptly stopping the celebrations could have potentially incited violence among the gathered crowd and adversely affected overall law and order situation across the city”.\n“The event commenced around 5.30 p.m., and a measured response was taken by curtailing the duration of the function. Instead of complete termination, a measured approach was adopted by allowing the event to proceed with significantly curtailed duration and enhanced monitoring,” the government has said in its status report submitted to the court on June 12.\nThe report has now become public as a Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice V. Kameswar Rao and Justice C.M. Joshi, which had on June 5suo motuinitiated a public interest litigation petition on the stampede incident, had on July 8 rejected the government’s plea to keep the report in a sealed cover while stating that the issue involved is neither of national security nor of privacy rights.\nThis tactical decision considered the evolving ground situation, crowd psychology, the massive scale of the gathering, and the information asymmetry among the assembled masses, the government said in the report, which was submitted to the court on June 12 in a sealed cover.\n“The risk of large-scale rioting both within the stadium premises and throughout Bengaluru necessitated this careful balancing approach, prioritising overall public safety over immediate event cessation. It is common and known in law and order situations that cancellation of anticipated events can incite the crowd tremendously and lead to widespread mob violence, as has been seen in several events where such decisions have been take,” it has been claimed in the report.\nThe government has also reiterated its consistent stand that the stampede occurred due to the RCB’s call to fans through social media about the victory parade and organising the event without obtaining permission as per the law.\nThe status report also disclosed that “recognising potential intelligence failures”, the government transferred the head of Intelligence (Hemant M. Nimbalkar, Additional Director-General of Police-Intelligence) and appointed a new Intelligence chief in his place."

    "content": "A section of the faculty, students, and alumni of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) has opposed the move to shift the department from the Lakeside (Marine) campus in the city to the university’s main campus in Thrikkakara.\nThey said the strength of the programme lies in its natural and necessary integration with other Earth Science disciplines such as Physical Oceanography and Geology, which were housed on the Marine campus. The university authorities revealed the decision was taken because the lab and radar facilities required for the course were located on the main campus.\nFormer students had urged the authorities not to shift the department, stating that Meteorology was not a stand-alone subject. Its strength lay in its integration with allied Earth Science fields. Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences were inherently interconnected, particularly in understanding large-scale systems such as climate change, monsoons, and weather prediction. They said separating these disciplines across campuses would fragment the curriculum and weaken research collaborations.\nThe authorities pointed out that the decision to shift the department from the lakeside campus to the main campus had been taken on the basis of a recommendation by a subcommittee of the Syndicate. They said a major research facility like the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR) was located on the main campus. The shifting had been suggested to ease the woes that arose from carrying out various departmental functions from two campuses. The integration would resolve the problem, they added.\nThose opposing the relocation pointed out that the radar centre primarily served as a data collection centre and that the analysis of atmospheric data could be done remotely from anywhere in the world."

    "content": "A day after holding talks with Telangana over river water sharing, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday asserted that there is no need for a confrontation with the neighbouring State and advocated for `give and take’ policy to resolve the issues.\n“Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana should prosper and develop. Andhra Pradesh will bear the cost of repairs to the Srisailam Project plunge pool. I have asked Telangana to utilise the Godavari river waters, if needed, and asked it to cooperate with inter-linking of rivers,” Mr. Naidu said, addressing a gathering of water users associations and farmers at Malyala in Nandikotkur mandal of Nandyal district.\nEarlier, Mr. Naidu offered Jala Harathi and released water from the Malyala pump house into the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi canal which has been expanded within 100 days after commencing the works by the NDA government.\nExplaining his efforts to resolve water sharing issues, he said they have decided to establish the Godavari River Water Board in Hyderabad and the Krishna Board in Vijayawada. “I want to provide water to every acre of land in Rayalaseema. Completion of the Vedavati project will provide water to Aluru, Adoni and Mantralayam Assembly Constituencies. We want to take water till Chittoor district. We will complete the Adivipalli reservoir and take water from Handri to Neeva branch canal,” he said. They will provide water to Chittoor next year, he added.\nChief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu performing puja to the Krishna river, in Nandyal on Thursday.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                PTI\n“The water that starts from the footsteps of Mallanna (Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna swamy temple at Srisailam) will be taken to Venkanna (Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala) at Tirupati. This is not just inter-linking of rivers but also Gods. We will prepare plans accordingly,” he said.\nMr. Naidu said the party general secretary and IT Minister Nara Lokesh had released the Rayalaseema Declaration during his Yuvagalam Padayatra and the same will be implemented. “People of Rayalaseema have elected us with huge margins and we will never forget the promises made to the region. We will develop the region industrially. We will commence Drone City in Orvakal of Kurnool district. We will set up High Court bench in Kurnool and also complete the Rayalaseema Steel Plant in Kadapa,” Mr. Naidu said.\nTaking potshots at the previous government, the Chief Minister said earlier schools were run without teachers while they have started recruitment of 16,000 teachers through DSC soon after coming to power. ‘‘Similarly, we have come to the rescue of the mango farmers by providing ₹4 per kg support price and also purchased tobacco from farmers,” he said and added that the government would deposit Annadata Sukhibava financial assistance to farmers in three instalments.\nMr. Naidu reiterated that the promise of free bus ride to women would also be fulfilled and they would also extend financial assistance to the unemployed as promised.\nThe Chief Minister recalled launching the Handri-Neeva project in 1995 at Uravakonda, a 554-km-long canal many once called impossible. He highlighted sanctioning ₹3,890 crore for canal expansion, completed in just 100 days. Mr. Naidu promised that within 10-15 days, water will reach the last villages and all reservoirs in drought-prone Rayalaseema will be filled."

Under such circumstances, the inspector is required to handover the charge by writing it down on the station house dairy.\nBut this is not happening for many reasons, and the people who come to the station with their grievances have to wait for the officer in charge to return. This is resulting in inordinate delays in handling the complaints that require immediate attention.\nRecently, in the Whitefield police station limits, a food delivery executive was robbed of his mobile phone by two men on a scooter at knife point. When the victim went to file a complaint, the staff reportedly sent him back saying that the officer had gone out and asked him to come back later.\nMany complaints and disputes that come to the station can be resolved through dialogue on the spot if attended immediately, a senior police officer said.\n“We are aware of the issue and are taking measures to resolve it at the earliest,” Mr. Singh added."

    "content": "Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee has called for a review of the functioning of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), flagging several concerns, including the high rate of failure of Aadhaar biometric verification which can lead to many beneficiaries being excluded from social welfare schemes.\nAt its meeting on Thursday (July 17, 2025), the committee, headed by senior Congress leader K.C. Venugopal, received a briefing from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) team which produced a 2021 report on the UIDAI. The panel also listened to oral evidence from officials of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and the UIDAI itself. “This is a common man’s issue. We flagged various problems and have raised several questions,” Mr. Venugopal told reporters at the conclusion of the meeting.\nAcross party lines, MPs on the committee pointed out that biometric verification failure is a serious issue since the majority of the government’s social welfare schemes are tied directly to Aadhaar. This has led to many eligible beneficiaries being prevented from recieving food rations or jobs, under schemes such as the Public Distribution System or the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, because their biometric data no longer matches the UIDAI record.\nThe UIDAI officials, according to sources, explained that in many cases of people doing hard labour, their fingerprints are not read properly by the machines. In the case of elderly people, there is often a failure in matching iris patterns. However, the officials also insisted that the UIDAI is constantly upgrading its systems to address these challenges.\nSources said that several MPs also cited various reports to underline the dangers of data leaks. The UIDAI officials claimed that their central repository is unbreachable, and their investigations have shown that whatever leak has been reported has come from the enrolment centres. They added that UIDAI has strengthened the monitoring mechanism to plug all holes.\nSome estimates suggest that there are more Aadhaar cards currently in use than the total population of the country, indicating possible duplications as well as delays in deactivating the cards of the deceased. The UIDAI officials said that in the case of the deceased, it is dependent on voluntary deactivation. The PAC directed the UIDAI to act proactively to clean up the list of Aadhaar card holders."

She had reportedly racked up debts of nearly ₹5 lakh through online gambling. Exploiting the family’s routine visits to Karmanghat, she stole a key from her sister-in-law’s purse and roped in two friends, Karthik and Akhil, to carry out the theft,” explained the officer.\nThe trio made away with 12 tolas of gold jewellery, silver ornaments, and cash. A portion of the gold was later pledged to repay her betting debts.\nCCTV footage proved crucial in tracking the suspects’ movements, leading to their arrest on Thursday, July 17.

    "content": "Nived would have turned 10 on July 7, but fate had other plans. He lies in a single grave with his siblings Dhyan and Ishan at Puthumala in Meppadi, their lives cut short in the devastating Wayanad disaster of July 30, 2024.\nDespite the light showers, the remnants of a heart-wrenching tribute left by their grieving parents remain: cakes, chocolate bars, pens, and toy bikes scattered on the grave, a reminder of the joy that would never be.\nThe darkness of that fateful night still lingers in the minds of the Chooralmala-Mundakkai disaster survivors. July 30, 2024 was a day that will forever be remembered as a day of unmitigated tragedy in Wayanad.\nThe cries of the lost, the screams of the terrified, and the desperate wails for help still echo through the ravaged landscape, a haunting reminder of the lives forever shattered.\nFor the survivors, the memories of that night are a painful wound that refuses to heal. Those memories constantly remind them of what was lost and what can never be regained. As they struggle to rebuild their lives, the question that haunts them is: will the wounds of that night ever fade, or will they remain a perpetual scar on the hearts of those who lived through it?\nNoufal Kalathingal’s eyes still hold the weight of his unimaginable loss: 11 family members, including his mother, wife, and children. Yet he finds solace in rebuilding his life. His bakery-cum-restaurant, ‘July 30,’ is a reminder of the day that changed his life forever. The date etched into his shop’s name is a bittersweet reminder of the family he lost while he was away in Muscat.\nA lone schoolboy stands desolately at Chooralmala, a village ravaged by the devastating landslides that struck on July 30, 2024.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SAKEER HUSSAIN\nNoufal’s voice trembled as he revealed the cafe’s inspiration. “My wife always dreamed of me coming home to start a cafe. July 30 is for her,” he says in words faltering with emotion.\n“I still hear my wife Shaija’s cries for help in my mind. I lost her and 11 other family members, including my brother and his wife, that fateful night,” says K.R. Unnikrishnan. A wistful smile on this mason’s face hints at a fragile acceptance, a tentative truce with the unbearable loss.\n“I close my eyes, and the memories come flooding back. The sound of the landslide, like a massive helicopter lowering, still echoes in my mind almost a year later,” recalls Abdul Salam, a pick-up van driver, who lost 29 family members. “That night taught me what fear truly is,” he says, his eyes gleaming with a rare intensity.\nHeart-wrenching stories of the tragedy, survival, and unbearable losses are a familiar narrative for hundreds of people who lived through the disaster. They are spread out across Wayanad and are living in rented accommodations. Many still find it unbearable to even consider returning to the village that was once their home and a gem of the Meppadi panchayat in Wayanad.\nThe government has declared a substantial area of Mundakkai and Chooralmala as unsafe for habitation. Several houses that escaped damage from the landslides and floods have also been declared unfit for occupation. A committee led by geoscientist John Mathai has identified 107.5 hectares as unsafe, recommending restrictions on construction and human activity in these vulnerable areas.\nThe district administration has prohibited entry to the areas ravaged by the disaster, which were once a favourite among tourists for their scenic landscapes. Repeated requests from this reporter for a revisit to the area of devastation on its first anniversary too fell on deaf ears. “Sorry, we can’t let you in,” asserts Additional District Magistrate of Wayanad K. Devaki.\nThe site poses significant risks with open wells concealed under layers of soft mud and septic tanks, potentially stripped of their concrete covers, creating hidden dangers. A careless step could prove disastrous. Furthermore, the Bailey bridge, hastily constructed by the Army soon after the disaster, has developed worrying cracks in its foundation, say government officials who refuse to be quoted.\nThe government is clearing the debris, including massive boulders. The Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society has started clearing the Punnapuzha riverbed as part of a ₹195-crore river rejuvenation project.\nThis handout photograph taken on July 30, 2024 and released by India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) shows a damaged car at the landslide site in Wayanad. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                AFP\nThe official toll of buildings stands at 482 destroyed, 242 partially damaged, and 661 deemed unfit for habitation, with most of the buildings being residential homes.\nOfficial records indicate that the landslides caused 298 fatalities, with 32 people reported missing. The recovery efforts yielded 223 body parts from different areas. The floodwaters swept away mangled limbs, severed heads, and dismembered torsos downstream, cascading through treacherous waterfalls, including Soochipara Falls, before leaving a trail of unimaginable horror as far as Vazhakkad, nearly 50 km away from Chooralmala. Furthermore, 35 people were injured and significant crop damage was reported, with 29.2216 hectares of agricultural land destroyed.\nPeople of Meppadi estimate that the fatalities could exceed official numbers and might potentially reach 400 due to suspected casualties of migrant workers. Abdul Salam shares this concern, stating that the DNA examination process was hindered by the absence of references to match the body parts. “It has complicated the fatality count,” he says.\nThe graveyard at Harrison Malayalam tea estate at Puthumala features tombstones with cryptic labels such as N18 and N244, reflecting the confusion about unidentified victims. Many of the numbered tombstones were replaced with inscriptions bearing the victims’ names once they were identified.\nThe single grave of Nived, Dhyan, and Ishan, victims of the landslides,  is tenderly adorned with toys, cakes, and chocolates, a heartfelt tribute from their devastated parents.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SAKEER HUSSAIN\nThe graveyard stands as a testimony to the communal harmony that defined the lives of Chooralmala and Mundakkai residents. In death, as in life, victims of different faiths are resting together, with Hindus and Muslims lying side by side. Niyas Erakkadan’s grave is nestled between those of Vishnu Sudevan and Rukmini Vadakke Cheruvil, while Rahmat Latheef’s grave is flanked by Sudevan’s and V.S. Sajimon’s.\nDeath is the greatest leveller, they say.\nThe graveyard’s solemn landscape tells a heart-wrenching tale. Some graves hold siblings together in eternal rest, while others are a haunting testament to the disaster’s brutality, with a single life scattered across multiple graves: a head in one, torso in another, limbs in yet another, a painful reminder of the fragments of lives lost.\n“Visiting this place will inevitably leave its mark on your heart,” warns Wayanad district panchayat president Samshad Marakkar. He is unable to hide the scars of trauma that he endured as a leading rescuer in the early hours of July 30, 2024.\nDespite the trauma they have endured, survivors are struggling to cope with their new reality while living in temporary shelters. However, with humanitarian aid, some are showing remarkable resilience and determination to rebuild their lives.\nA flurry of organisations rushed to help survivors after the tragedy, but the relief efforts were marred by uneven distribution. Some received ample support while others were left empty-handed, fuelling discontent and protests. The confusion was compounded by the blurred lines between private and government aid, leaving many feeling frustrated and overlooked.\nLabourers being transported in an open pick-up van to a tea estate near Chooralmala.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SAKEER HUSSAIN\nAbdul Majeed’s words echo with frustration: “Some people got undeserved benefits while others did not get what they deserved. An organisation gave me an autorickshaw, but I cannot run it without a permit. To get one, I will have to spend ₹1.75 lakh. But people see the autorickshaw and think I have hit the jackpot, not knowing I am struggling to make ends meet after losing my home.”\nWhile private groups and organisations stepped in to help the survivors rebuild their livelihoods, the government support was scarce. A government-backed initiative to create a tailoring village, which provided sewing machines to survivors, fell flat as few were interested in the trade. Some beneficiaries even sold the machines they received at half price.\nThe survivors had to agitate to get the government’s temporary relief measures extended for a year. Initially, the government had offered ₹6,000 per month for families as rent and ₹9,000 for two members of each family for three months as financial support, and the survivors fought for this assistance to be continued until this July.\n“The government’s inflexible rules have failed the survivors, forcing them to fight for their rights. While officials stick strictly to protocol, we are driven by humanitarian concerns,” says Marakkar.\nMarakkar points out that the government’s rigid rules forced the survivors to fight for their rights. “The John Mathai report was a case in point where protests led to Dr. Mathai revising his rules,” he says. “If his document has been scientific, no agitation could alter it,” he adds.\nThe government is pushing forward with a massive rehabilitation project, constructing a model township at Elstone Estate in Kalpetta. But the initiative has been marred by confusion, with political parties and organisations offering competing housing schemes. The Indian Union Muslim League is at odds with the government over its offer of around 100 houses.\nMany people are questioning the government about the utilisation of ₹776 crore contributed to the Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund for the Wayanad tragedy.\nA new bus bridges the gap, ferrying students from Chooralmala to the Government Higher Secondary School’s temporary premises at Meppadi, after landslides destroyed the Vellarimala school building. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SAKEER HUSSAIN\nRevenue Minister K. Rajan says the government has spent ₹108.21 crore on relief efforts, which includes ₹43.77 crore for land acquisition, ₹13.3 crore in compensation to victim families, ₹15.6 crore in housing assistance to 104 families, ₹10.1 crore for livelihood support to 1,133 people, ₹1.3 crore in immediate aid, ₹4.3 crore in rental assistance, and additional amounts for injured persons and funeral expenses.\nThe government has begun work on a model township with 410 houses on 64 hectares of land on the Kalpetta bypass road. At present, 104 beneficiaries have opted out and received ₹15 lakh each. Government officials say they will complete the township by December. Each beneficiary will receive a 1,000-sq. ft house on seven cents of land, with amenities, including a health centre, a modern anganwadi, commercial spaces, and a community centre. The construction is being handled by the ULCCS, and a model house is almost ready.\nAs their wounds slowly begin to heal, the people of Chooralmala and Mundakkai will continue to carry the scars of that fateful night. Their journey to recovery will be long and painful. As they rebuild their homes and their lives, they remind us that their resilience will be the guiding light in the darkness."

She is undergoing treatment at a hospital. No arrests have been made so far.\nObserving that the matter was a serious violation of human rights, the commission issued notices to the Chairman, Railway Board, Ministry of Railways, and the Director-General of Police, Haryana, calling for a detailed report on the matter within two weeks. The report is expected to include the status of the health of the victim and compensation if any, provided to her by the authorities.\nAccording to reports, the woman’s husband filed a complaint with the police on June 26, 2025, stating that his wife was missing since June 24, after they had a quarrel. Based on the complaint, the police launched a search and found her on the railway tracks near Hindu College in Sonepat on the night of June 26.\nThe victim, in her statement to the police, revealed that she had been battling depression since the death of her three-year-old son nearly a month ago and had left the house after a fight with her husband. She was reportedly sitting at the Panipat railway station when a man approached her and took her inside an empty bogie of a stationary train and raped her. Later, two other men also came there and sexually assaulted her. The accused then took her to Sonepat and threw her on the rail tracks."

    "content": "The Cabinet meeting held here on Thursday gave in-principle approval for constructing a protective seawall along the sea erosion-hit areas on the Pozhiyoor-Kollemcode stretch in Thiruvananthapuram. The work, valued at ₹43.65 crore, will be carried out on a 1.2-km stretch as per the design approved by the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR).\nSea erosion and beach depletion had endangered the lives and properties of hundreds of fisherfolk along the coastal stretch, leading to friction with authorities, especially during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period.\nAccording to a Cabinet note, a PMU (project management unit)/coordination committee will be formed on the lines of the model adopted in Chellanam in Ernakulam to implement the project. The Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC) will be appointed as the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), and the funds will be made available through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), said the Cabinet briefing.\nThe people on the coastal stretch had been up in arms against the administration, as close to 4,500 families in the village have been facing the brunt of the coastal erosion due to the delay in implementing the long-term project to safeguard the shoreline of Pozhiyoor. Each monsoon season, hundreds of families are shifted to relief camps as the lashing waves often gnaw away substantial portions of the shoreline, flooding the coastal hamlets.\nRecently, the State government cleared the decks for the construction of a new fishing harbour at Pozhiyoor, as demanded by the fisherfolk here for a long time, and announced ₹5 crore for the first phase of the project. The fisherfolk in the region have been demanding the construction of a protective seawall and harbour simultaneously, as they feared that construction of a seawall alone would obstruct their fishing activities. Pozhiyoor is one of the 10 hotspots vulnerable to severe coastal erosion in the State identified by the Irrigation department."

    "content": "In the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, the Union Home Ministry (MHA) has enhanced security at vital installations across the country, including the Parliament building and nuclear plants.\nThe Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel deployed at the Parliament building are being trained with the Army to combat terrorist strikes, drone attacks and internal sabotage, a CISF official said on Thursday (July 17, 2025). Their weapons will be upgraded in the coming days too, the official said. The training module of canine squads is also being changed.\nTheCISF took over Parliament securityin June 2024 following a security breach in the new Parliament building on December 13, 2023. It replaced the Delhi Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The monsoon session of Parliament begins on July 21.\nThe official said that the joint-training exercises with the Indian Army are to make the CISF “battle-ready” against unconventional and hybrid threats.\n“The training with the Army will prepare the CISF personnel to respond swiftly to crises at high-risk installations such as airports, nuclear facilities, government buildings, and Parliament. The emphasis is on handling complex, high-pressure scenarios such as drone incursions, coordinated terrorist attacks, insider threats, and sabotage operations with speed, precision, and calm,” the official said.\nIn response to the April 22 terror attack at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), in which 26 civilians were killed, India launched military strikes on nine terrorist camps and terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. Pakistan launched drone attacks at several vital installations in India, including airports and power plants, particularly in J&K and Punjab.\nAs part of the efforts to secure critical installations, the National Security Guard (NSG) also surveyed 17 religious sites, 21 nuclear installations and 14 sensitive locations recently. Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the security of such installations after Operation Sindoor and directed the CISF to train its personnel in the wake of emerging threats from Pakistan, the official said.\n“For the first time, the CISF is conducting training at Indian Army formations in the Kashmir Valley. Previously, only a limited number of CISF personnel were allotted seats for such exercises. The goal is to equip the personnel to handle contingencies such as armed infiltration, sabotage, and multi-pronged terror strikes in both urban and rural environments,” the official said.\nThe personnel selected for the high-intensity training are part of CISF’s Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs)—the first responders to emergencies. “Only those under 35 years of age and who have passed the Battle Physical Efficiency Test (BPET) aligned with National Security Guard (NSG) standards are eligible,” said the official."

The previous year’s estimate counted 11 males, 15 females and seven cubs.\nThe number of adult tigers rose from 26 to 34, reflecting a steady positive trend, said a statement from the Field Director, Project Tiger. Notably, the increase in breeding females signifies improved reproductive success and population resilience.\nThe monitoring exercise was carried out in accordance with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) protocols, covering 10 forest ranges divided into four spatial blocks for effective and systematic data collection, the statement said.\nA total 1,594 camera traps were deployed in the reserve between December 20, 2024 and May 15, 2025 for identifying the tigers.

Narendran and Justice Muralee Krishna S. wanted the board to clarify whether it had issued permission to any one to install the idol.\nThe Bench initiated the proceedings based on a report filed by R. Jayakrishnan, Sabarimala Special Commissioner, who noted that the TDB had permitted the chairperson of a multi-speciality hospital in Erode to install an idol of Ayyappa made of panchaloham, an alloy of five precious metals, at the temple, without hindering the temple structure and rituals.\nThe report also took note of the distribution of pamphlets bearing bank account number, QR code and mobile numbers that said that a two-feet high idol weighing 108 kg and costing ₹9 lakh was to be installed there. A fundraising campaign also began, on the strength of the ‘permission’ granted by the TDB, creating an impression that he was authorised to do so by the TDB and the State government, the report said.\nThe Sabarimala Tantri had informed the Special Commissioner that he was unaware of the alleged attempt to install the idol, which was against temple rituals. The Special Commissioner sought the interference of the court in the issue and stringent directions to stop such practices in the temple.\nThe TDB submitted before the court that no permission was granted to the hospital’s chairperson to install any idol on the temple premises. Neither was permission granted to collect money from the public, it contended.\nThe court directed the TDB to issue an advisory in the Virtual-Q platform that it has not authorised anyone to install an idol of Ayyappa for worship on the temple premises or to collect money from the public for the purpose. The case has been listed for hearing on Friday."

Revanth Reddy received a relief with the Telangana High Court, on Thursday, quashing a case registered against him under the provisions of the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act.\nThe case was pending before the Special Sessions Judge for Trial of cases under the POA against SCs/STs Act-cum-VII Additional District Sessions Judge of Ranga Reddy at L.B. Nagar.\nJustice Moushumi Bhattacharya, pronouncing the verdict in a criminal petition filed by Mr. Revanth Reddy seeking to quash the FIR, said that Mr. Revanth Reddy, third accused in the case, was not present at the scene of offence when the crime was “said to have been committed”. Since the accused was not present at the time of commission of the crime, invoking the special Act would not arise, the judge said.\nShe noted that the complainant could not make out the offence against Mr. Revanth Reddy. The special Act was invoked against him without any legal or factual basis, she said.\nThe case was contrary to the contents mentioned in the charge-sheet. Going by the facts of the case and the details mentioned in the charge-sheet, the HC can exercise powers under Section 484 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the present case, she said.\nAn advocate B.S. Rao, appearing for the de-facto complainant N. Peddi Raju, brought to the notice of the judge that the complainant had five days ago, filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to transfer hearing of the case to any other High Court.\nReferring to contention of the complainant about the petition in Supreme Court for transfer of the case, the judge said that ‘the parties are at liberty to take whatever steps they intend to take, but this court has passed its orders as it is the duty of the court to pass orders’.\nThe case was being heard by the HC since September 22, 2020. A co-ordinate bench of the HC heard contentions of the parties till April 15, 2024. Eventually, the Acting Chief Justice of the HC assigned the matter to the present bench. The matter was heard by the bench on April 25, May 2 and June 14 of this year. The senior counsel appearing for Revanth Reddy, the Public Prosecutor and the counsel for the de-facto complainant presented their contentions. After hearing their extensive arguments only, the bench had reserved orders in the matter, the judge said."

    "content": "With the festival season round the corner,  the rising price of coconut oil has become a concern for many households in the State. If the prevailing copra and coconut prices are any indication, the average price of a litre of coconut oil will be anywhere between ₹500 and ₹600 during the Onam festival season.\nIn addition, the demand for coconut is expected to rule high till December with   festivals in northern  India  and the Sabarimala pilgrimage in Kerala.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,an officer at the Coconut Development Board (CDB) said there had been a big drop in coconut production in the country due to shrinking patronage for coconut cultivation and the adverse impact of climate change.\n“Besides this, there was a glut in the market during the pandemic outbreak in 2020 and 2021, with sales and consumption of copra and coconut oil plummeting. However, as soon as the market reopened after the pandemic,  the hoarded produce flooded the market, significantly lowering the price of copra and coconut oil, with coconut farmers taking a hit,” the officer said.\nThis was followed by a drop in coconut production in equatorial countries, including in India, due to climate change and the reluctance of farmers to take care of trees, lowering production and increasing the price for copra, coconut oil and allied products, the officer said.\nTalath Mahamood, president, Cochin Oil Merchant’s Association, said the rise in coconut oil prices had opened the window for adulterated coconut oil manufacturers to flood the market with spurious products. The alarming price rise had also upset the family budget of many. The retail coconut oil price was ₹460 a litre on Thursday, almost a 100% rise compared to ₹235 during the first of January 2025.\nAlthough cooking oils such as palm oil (₹120/850 gm) and sunflower oil (₹150/litre) are available in the market, the majority of Malayalis prefer coconut oil for home cooking.\nMr. Mahamood said as an immediate measure to protect the industry, the Centre should urgently intervene and ban the export of coconut, copra, coconut oil, and allied products, at least for a brief period. Further, the restrictions imposed on the import of coconut and copra from countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines should be lifted, considering the precarious situation."

As a result, patients are left with no choice but to wait or seek costly alternatives elsewhere.\nThe MRI scanner, crucial for diagnosing and monitoring tumors, reportedly broke down ten days ago, while the mammogram machine — vital for breast cancer screening — has been non-functional for over a fortnight, according to hospital staff.\nPatients and their families, many of whom travel from rural areas and depend on the subsidised services at Kidwai, said they cannot afford private diagnostic centers where the cost of an MRI or mammogram can run into thousands of rupees.\n“I came here three days ago for my scan, and they told me the machine is not working. They asked me to come back after a week, but I cannot stay in Bengaluru for very long. Where will I go?” asked a 47-year-old breast cancer patient from Mandya district.\nSources said that the breakdown has caused severe bottlenecks. “We are trying to prioritise urgent cases. The repairs are taking longer than expected,” a doctor said.\nThe hospital officials acknowledged the problem and said that tenders for repair and maintenance are under way. “The MRI and mammogram machines are undergoing repair due to technical issues. To ensure that diagnostic services continue without disruption, alternative arrangements have been made,” said an official statement from the institute director.\n“MRI scans are now being facilitated at NIMHANS and Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedics, based on a formal agreement (MoU) with these institutions. Patients admitted at Kidwai are being referred and provided the necessary diagnostic support at these centres,” the statement said.\nThe State government has approved the procurement of a new MRI machine, and steps are under way to repair the existing mammogram machine, it added."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday (July 17, 2025) upheld the right of the legal heirs of a Scheduled Tribe woman to an equal share in their maternal grandfather’s ancestral property.\n“There appears to be no rational nexus or reasonable classification for only males to be granted succession over the property of their forebears and not women, more so in the case where no prohibition to such effect can be shown to be prevalent as per law… Article 15(1) states that the state shall not discriminate against any person on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. This, along with Articles 38 and 46, points to the collective ethos of the Constitution in ensuring that there is no discrimination against women,” a Bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Joymalya Bagchi held.\nThe court said refusing a woman her right of share in a property only deepened gender discrimination.\nThe judgment was based on an appeal filed by the legal heirs who had sought the partition of a property belonging to their maternal grandfather.\nThe judgment authored by Justice Karol observed that customs too, like the law, could not remain stuck in time.\n“Others cannot be allowed to take refuge in customs or hide behind them to deprive others of their right,” the court observed.\nThe lower courts had dismissed the plea by the legal heirs saying their mother had no right in the property of her father on the ground that Scheduled Tribes were not governed by the Hindu Succession Act. The trial court and the appellate court had held that there was no evidence that the children of a woman heir were also entitled to property.\nThe top court, allowing the appeal, said denying the woman’s heirs a share of their maternal grandfather’s property would violate their right to equality."

    "content": "Minister for School Education Madhu Bangarappa said the free online coaching for CET, NEET, and JEE for admission to engineering, medical, and other professional courses will be extended to all government and aided Pre-University Colleges (PU) in the State for the current academic year.\nDuring an interactive session atThe Hinduoffice on Thursday, the Minister said, “Last year, online coaching for the entrance examinations was provided to only 25,000 selected students in government and aided PU colleges. Since there is a huge demand for online coaching among students, it will be extended to all government and aided students in the State this year.”\n“Most of the students studying in government and aided PU colleges belong to economically and socially backward families. Due to financial constraints, they cannot join private coaching centres. From 2024-25, the State government has implemented a free online coaching scheme for them. Last year, a student of a government PU college who received free online coaching joined IIT this year,” Mr. Madhu Bangarappa said.\n“All students who enroll for online training will be given separate login IDs to participate in the classes. In addition, free videos related to the course will be provided. Students from private colleges will also be able to receive this training externally. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions online and get answers,” he said.\nMinister for School Education Madhu Bangarappa said that after recording 75% results in SSLC and II PU, annual exam 1, 2, and 3 may be withdrawn in a phased manner.\n“To prevent malpractices in the exams and provide quality results, SSLC and PU examinations have been conducted strictly through webcasting since last year. Due to this, malpractices have come down. However, this has affected the results and last year, the SSLC examination results saw a huge decline. The pass marks were reduced, and the results were announced by providing 20 grace marks. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had expressed displeasure over the grace marks being given and had given a target of 75% results without any grace marks in the coming years,” he said.\n“Every year, about 2.76 lakh students fail in SSLC and II PU annual exam 1. If they are given another chance, they too pass in just one month. Hence, annual exam 1 and 2 have been implemented. We have already recorded 73% results from exam 1 and 2 of SSLC and II PU this year. If 75% results are recorded in annual exam 1 in the coming years, we will decide on withdrawing annual exam 2 and 3 after discussions,” he added.\nMadhu Bangarappa said that it has already been decided to reduce the pass marks of SSLC examination from 35 to 33 on the model of CBSE schools, and it will be implemented from the current academic year itself.\n“Pass marks of 33 have been fixed for all central curriculum schools across the country, including CBSE. This is a student-friendly measure and will reduce the burden on children. It has been decided to reduce the pass marks of SSLC students to 33, and a final order will be issued soon,” he said.\n“At the same time, there have also been demands to reduce the first language marks for SSLC students from 125 to 100. However, this is a very sensitive issue, I have to take care of my mother tongue. There is a big history behind setting 125 marks for the first language. So, an appropriate decision will be taken after discussing this with experts and the government,” he added."

Nagar-Sathanur road in protest for about 30 minutes warranting police intervention.\nThursday’s attack on the house of the councillor was a result of a quarrel that the councillor and her son allegedly had with a supervisor of a private firm that was given the contract for establishing rainwater harvesting structure in the area.\nOne of the residents had complained to the councillor that some stone slabs put on his vacant site had tilted because of the ongoing rainwater harvesting structure.\nThe councillor and her son Anand came to the spot and questioned the supervisor reportedly about the manner in which the work was carried out. The supervisor is said to have conveyed to the councillor that the work was going as per plan. The councillor’s son is alleged to have assaulted and threatened the supervisor who informed the firm owner. Separate complaints have been lodged by both the parties at K.K. Nagar police station.\nSources said the group that barged into the councillor’s house on Thursday damaged an air cooler, window panes, windshield of the car, and a  two-wheeler. A complaint regarding the attack has been preferred in this connection with the K.K. Nagar police by the councillor’s daughter-in-law. The K.K. Nagar police have taken up investigation."

    "content": "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Mani M. Sekhar, director of a private company, an alleged long-absconding proclaimed offender (PO) in connection with a bank fraud case of ₹8 crore. The accused was nabbed from Madhya Pradesh where she was living under assumed identity for nearly two decades.\nThe sleuths traced Mani with the help of an image searching tool.\nThe case was registered at CBI BSFB Bengaluru in August 2006 against the accused husband-wife duo Ramanujam Muthuramalingam Sekhar, MD, Indo Marks Pvt. Ltd., and Mani M. Sekhar, director, Indo Marks & BTC Home Products Pvt. Ltd., for allegedly having entered into a criminal conspiracy during the period 2002 to 2005. The duo, according to the CBI, fraudulently cheated the State Bank of India, Overseas Branch, Bengaluru, to the tune of ₹800 lakh through the misuse of non-fund-based limits in the name of Indo Marks Pvt. Ltd. and its sister concerns.\nAfter the completion of the investigation, the CBI filed the chargesheet in December 2007. Both the accused failed to join the trial or respond to summons and warrants. Since the duo was on the run, the CBI subsequently got the orders to declare them as POs in February 2009.\nDespite sustained efforts over the years to trace them, these absconding accused had remained untraceable, prompting CBI to announce a reward of ₹50,000 each for clues to informers.\nWhile other co-accused were tried and convicted and acquitted in the case, the trial against these two absconding accused remained pending. During this period the couple had changed their identities and never used the old KYC details, the officials said.\nThey changed their names to Krishna Kumar Gupta  and Geetha Krishna Kumar Gupta, their mobile numbers, emails, PAN numbers, and other information that were used before the chargesheet was filed.\nThe CBI leveraged advanced analytical capabilities of image search to track the digital footprints of the absconders. The image comparison and analysis tools led to the identification of these two accused living under changed names and identities in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.\nActing on this match, a team of CBI officers traced the accused to Indore, Madhya Pradesh, where they were living under assumed identities.\nIt was revealed during the search operation that Ramanujam had already expired in 2008 . The other accused, Mani was finally arrested on July 12 and produced before the Bengaluru court, which remanded the accused in judicial custody."

    "content": "Those who believe that government schools are inferior to private ones in terms of infrastructure and teaching facilities will change their opinion if they come across this Karnataka Public School (KPS) located in Honganuru village of Channapatna taluk in Bengaluru South district.\nThis government school is on a par with any international school in Bengaluru, as the 50-room school has about 40 computers, maths and science labs, digital teaching boards, a well-equipped library, and sports facilities among others.\nEarlier, this school was no different from any other government school of rural areas. But the transformation was possible due to the initiative of medical entrepreneur H.M. Venkatappa, a doctor and alumnus of this school, who contributed ₹14 crore to construct a new building and set up the required infrastructure.\n“I studied in this school from from the first to the eighth standard between 1949 and 1957. The teachers of this school were instrumental in shaping the foundation for my educational career. I went on to complete MBBS and MD, although I hailed from an ordinary family, associated with agriculture. The then head master of the school, a Gandhian, inspired me a lot. I decided to rebuild and modernise this school to mark my association with it and also to ensure that poor students from rural areas get access to high quality education free of cost,” said the 79-year-old doctor, who has set up the Kanva Diagnostics Services Private Limited after retiring from government service.\nThe old building on four-and-a-half acres of land was fully demolished in June 2022, and two new buildings were built in the next two-and-a-half years. The school has been turned into a KPS comprising LKG/UKG to II PU, offering both Kannada and English medium. The school, named after Dr. Venkatappa’s parents Chennamma and Manche Gowda, has already commenced its operations from this academic year.\nThe new school has already become so popular that the student strength has increased by 150 to 200 this year, taking the total number of students to around 800 at a time when government schools in general are reporting a massive drop in enrolment.\nIn addition to the one-time contribution of ₹14 crore, Dr. Venkatappa has also decided to make an annual contribution of around ₹10 lakh to take care of the maintenance of the school. As the school would have to hire guest teachers, he has decided to pay an additional ₹5,000 per head, apart from the monthly honorarium of ₹12,500 to be given by the government.\nThe new school will be inaugurated formally by Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Friday at a programme being organised by the State government. Minister for School Education Madhu Bangarappa said his department would try to get more such contributions through the involvement of School Development Monitoring Committees to improve other government schools as well."

    "content": "The Congress on Thursday (July 17, 2025) accused the government of departing from India’s traditional position on foreign policy matters without consulting Parliament and said it was time for recalibration, honest introspection and course correction to reclaim the country’s stature globally.\nThe main Opposition party also alleged that the government was weakening national consensus on the country’s foreign policy, claiming that it had lowered and weakened the country’s position globally, and demanded a comprehensive discussion on the issue in both houses of Parliament.\nThe party also took strong exception toIndia abstaining on the UN Resolution on Gazaceasefire, claiming this was not just unfortunate, but a painful and unacceptable decision.\nCongress spokesperson Anand Sharma said that the “drift” in India’s foreign policy was a matter of serious concern as it had weakened India’s voice in the comity of nations and suggested the government recalibrate its policy, do honest introspection and course correction in the country’s foreign policy approach.\nHe also said theIndo-U.S. trade agreement, talks for which were continuing, should be done keeping national interest foremost and no trade pact should be done under pressure.\n“There’s a matter of serious concern: that is a drift in our foreign policy — a visible decline of India’s influence in the world and the very fact that there had been fundamental departures to the detriment of India’s standing in the comity of nations at the United Nations,” Mr. Sharma said at a press conference.\nThe Congress leader called for a comprehensive debate on India’s foreign policy matters in Parliament and said no country in a democracy avoids or evades a discussion on its foreign policy.\n“...more damage is done by being non-transparent or opaque and not communicating with their own country first in a correct manner, so that we retain the strength of our voice in global affairs. Today, the multilateral world order of governance is under siege,” he said.\n“Foreign policy of a country and in case of India, historically, is meant to promote India’s national interest and also to take our worldview to our strategic partner countries to mobilise in support of what we feel is right and what would serve the larger cause of peace and humanity,” Mr. Sharma, a former Union Minister who handled key ministries including commerce and external affairs, said.\nForeign policy, as it had evolved since Independence, always had the backing of a broad-based national consensus, he said, adding that it had never been captive or hostage to partisan politics.\nThe Congress leader said the government of the day had the mandate to make decisions, but when it came to foreign policy, it involved everyone, and that’s why consensus was important.\n“Unfortunately, that national consensus has been weakened in recent years, if not completely broken down...on many occasions the government has arbitrarily chosen to depart from India’s traditional positions without consulting either the Parliament or informing it,” he alleged.\nMr. Sharma said India commanded an authority and respect in the world not because “we were a major economic or military power, but because we had the moral authority”.\n“We were acknowledged as a voice of humanity. And that’s why wherever the crisis came in the world, those affected countries looked up to India. Unfortunately, that’s no more the case,” he noted, adding that it was up to the government that how it retrieves India’s standing and rebuilds national consensus.\n“Looking at the situation as it is, it’s time for recalibration, honest introspection, and course correction in our foreign policy approach,” the former Union Minister asserted.\nStressing that equally important and integral to this was the neighbourhood policy, he said India was acknowledged as the pre-eminent power of South Asia.\n“Nobody can say that today. It’s for us to rethink our strategy, to engage in a manner that despite the challenges and complexities of the neighbourhood, India regains its strength and standing in its own region.”\n“Our advice to the government will also be that while engaging with the neighbourhood, we have to be cautious. A foreign policy is meant to engage with other sovereign countries. It must not be linked to the furtherance of any domestic, partisan or political agendas,” he stressed, cautioning “that would be not only a mistake but a blunder”.\n“Our purpose is not to just criticise or score points. It is to caution, to share our concerns,” he said.\nMr. Sharma also said that on June 12, when the UN General Assembly discussed the issue of Israeli attacks on Gaza and a resolution for immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities was brought on the matter and voted upon, 149 countries voted for the resolution, while India, the land of Gandhi, chose to abstain and didn’t vote for peace and ceasefire.\n“That’s painful and unacceptable. This one action diminished India’s credibility as the leader of the Global South. All the countries of the Global South voted for peace. How come the leader did not?” he asked.\nMr. Sharma claimed that not just the Global South, major European countries, including two permanent UN members, as well as “our traditional partners in BRICS, all four”, voted in favour of a ceasefire.\n“These countries in Europe also have good relations with Israel and the U.S., yet they voted for humanity, but we did not,” he said, adding that this was a fundamental departure from India’s traditional position.\n“We would urge the government that they should, as we wish to be, reclaim our moral standing as the voice of the Global South by speaking on this and prevail on our strategic and traditional partners to work for bringing peace in Gaza and the region,” the Congress leader said."

    "content": "The Karnataka government on Thursday decided to ask the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to review locations across the State before submitting its proposal for a nuclear power plant.\nWhile the NTPC has initially proposed Vijayapura, Koppal, and Raichur as possible locations, the State Cabinet, which met here on Thursday, decided to ask the corporation to consider the State as a unit and review possible locations across the State.\n“We have agreed on the need for a nuclear power project. However, we want the NTPC to study the whole State and submit a feasibility report on all possibilities to the government based on which a decision could be taken,” Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister H.K. Patil told presspersons in his post-Cabinet meeting briefing. He clarified that the State government had not given any guidelines to the NTPC on the project.\nThe Minister said the Cabinet has also decided to amend the definition of ‘plastic bag’ in the notifications issued on March 11, 2016, and April 4, 2018, banning the use of plastic bags and define it as ‘compostable plastic bag’. He said the amendment was being proposed to make the plastic management easier.\nThe other Cabinet decisions include approval of the purchase of 32 mobile forensic vehicles at a cost ₹20.4 crore, Horticulture Technology Park on 194.33 acres under the PPP model at Kanakagiri in Koppal district, and implementation of the Centrally- sponsored revamped distribution sector scheme by Chamundeshari Electricity Supply Company at a cost of ₹3,779.06 crore.\nIt also approved expansion of the area of Shettihalli wildlife reserve in Tirthahalli in Shivamogga district; setting up of mango and other horticulture produce management, procurement, processing, and preservation unit at Hangal in Haveri district at a cost of ₹35.07 crore on the lines of Common Infrastructure for Industrial Parks; purchase of 1,530 telemetric equipment at a cost of ₹19.89 crore, and setting up of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Constitution Chair in the University of Mysore at a cost of ₹10 crore."

Here, a school, a hospital, and accommodation for parents will be provided under one roof. The children will be provided free food, clothing, and accommodation, and students from class 1 to 12 will be accommodated,” he said, adding that the school will be started from the current academic year.\n“There are about 3,500 children suffering from cancer across the State, and if the disease is detected early, it can be completely cured. Children who come from outer districts and rural areas for cancer treatment do not have proper facilities. Due to this, most of them do not receive treatment,” he said.\n“Since children lose their hair during the treatment, they feel uncomfortable attending classes. Therefore, if they are enrolled in the residential school, they can stay with their parents until they are cured. Teachers will be appointed through non-governmental organizations, and doctors, nurses, and medical staff will be appointed by the government for treatment,” he said."

However, in 2022, Bengaluru had ranked 43rd among 45 participating cities in the same category. This year’s result marks an improvement of eight positions compared to the 2022 ranking. In 2023, Bengaluru ranked 125th out of 446 cities in the “above one lakh population” category.\nTop performers\nGujarat’s Ahmedabad topped the “above 10 lakh” category with a score of 12,079, followed closely by Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) with 12,067 points and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) with 12,001. Bengaluru scored 6,842.\nIn the “Super Swachh League City” category, Mysuru secured 5th place. In the State-wise rankings, Bengaluru stood at 15th. Davangere emerged as the top-performing city in Karnataka with a score of 9,131, followed by Hubballi-Dharwad and Hosadurga.\nBBMP Chief Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao acknowledged that Bengaluru has room for improvement and expressed confidence in better results in the future. “We have good plans for managing construction debris and solid waste, which will improve our standing in the next survey. We are currently transitioning to an Integrated Solid Waste Management system. Once that is in place, we will rank better,” Mr. Rao toldThe Hindu.\nHowever, activists say that Bengaluru should have done much better.\n“Bengaluru is losing score in a few parameters consistently since the last three Swachh Survekshan audits, among which is waste processing,” V. Ramprasad, a civic activist, said.\nHe said that Mysuru has improved substantially despite collecting less money from people when compared to Bengaluru.\nHow is it calculated\nUrban Local Bodies (ULBs) were assessed quarterly across four phases. They updated their Management Information System (MIS) monthly, which was validated through citizen feedback and reviewed by third-party assessors. Indicator-wise progress was documented and verified during the final survey in February 2025.\nThe new Swachh Survekshan indicators focused on cleanliness, waste segregation, collection, processing, landfill and dumpsite management, wastewater treatment, reuse, and faecal sludge management. MoHUA conducted virtual sessions with States and ULBs to explain the methodology. Citizen engagement was vital, supported by digital, social, and traditional media campaigns to raise awareness and promote participation in the cleanliness mission."

    "content": "Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday (July 17, 2025) said the doubts that the Opposition INDIA bloc had about theongoing special intensive revision (SIR) in Biharwere proving to be right.\nThe remarks by the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly came a day after theElection Commission (EC) saidthat over 35 lakh voters were not found at their addresses during the electoral roll revision drive in the State.\nMr. Yadav who was accompanied by other leaders of the INDIA bloc at his official residence, reiterated his allegation that the EC was working at the behest of the ruling BJP. He said that through SIR, “not only are the rights of the people being snatched, but also their existence. There is a conspiracy to deprive them of all kinds of government welfare schemes by deleting their names from the voters’ list”.\nLashing out at the EC, Mr. Yadav said a delegation of INDIA bloc leaders had also met the Election Commission officials in Delhi and Bihar but to no avail. Even the instructions of the Supreme Court are not being complied with by the poll body, he said.\n“This makes it clear that there is something fishy. Even after the advice of the Supreme Court, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar remained silent on this matter and he is engaged in the work given to him by (Home Minister) Amit Shah, this is dangerous for democracy. We will fight for the protection of justice and democracy at every level,” Mr. Yadav said.\nHe said that on July 19, ameeting will be held at the residenceof Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi, which he will too will attend.\nRaising questions on the revision, Mr. Yadav said, “Three days ago, several newspapers reported that 35 lakh voters’ names would be removed, quoting sources. On July 16, EC quoted the same figures. The question is, when the process is going on, how did the news of deletion of names of so many voters get disclosed when there are still eight days left for the SIR to conclude?”\nIn a statement issued by the EC headquarters on July 16, it said enumeration forms were received from 88.65% residents for inclusion in the revised voters’ list. Around 4.5% electors – 35,69,435 voters – were not found at their addresses, it said.\n“In Bihar, journalists are facing FIRs for showing the truth. By pressurising the booth-level officers (BLOs), the names of voters are being uploaded fraudulently without their knowledge through BJP people with the help of fake signatures. There is video footage that shows all this,” Mr. Yadav said.\nThe Raghopur MLA said, “People are being removed from the voters’ list. They will now be deprived of all kinds of facilities, the civil rights they have. Like ration, pension, reservation facility, Kisan Samman Nidhi, subsidy, scholarship, housing scheme, social security pension and public welfare schemes.”\nThe former Deputy Chief Minister also alleged that the preparations are under way to remove the names of 12% to 15% voters in Bihar. He claimed that there are 22,000 booths where the booth-level officers have not even started the work. The EC is not giving any clear information on it, he said.\nMr. Yadav pointed out that within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), TDP leader and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has also raised questions on the SIR, but JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was silent.\nBihar Congress president Rajesh Kumar too alleged that voters’ names were being selectively removed on the basis of their surnames.\nAll India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K.C. Venugopal posted a message on social media account X alleging: “The revelations from the SIR exercise completely expose the BJP-controlled ECI. Preliminary estimates suggest 35 lakh voters are being disenfranchised in this hurried process.”\nHe further said, “On the ground, document requirements are creating havoc, BLOs have absolute discretion in enrolling or rejecting voters, and voters are worried about whether their right to vote will remain or be snatched away from them. Journalists who expose this blatant ‘Votebandi’ are being slapped with FIRs, and hateful agendas are peddled to distract from the real issue at hand. This reeks of mass-scale election rigging, and we will never let it pass.”"

    "content": "A petition filed by the Bhopal gas disaster victims’ rights groups claiming that survivors with lasting, severe injuries and illnesses have been wrongly classified under ‘temporary disablement’ and ‘minor injury’ and under-compensated for years has been lined up for hearing in the Supreme Court.\nThe petition filed by organisations such as the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha urged the top court to direct the Centre to identify these “misclassified” victims and classify them correctly under the provisions of the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985 so that they receive adequate compensation to cover their medical treatment.\nThe Centre has termed the Bhopal gas leak tragedy ‘the world’s largest industrial disaster”. Both the government and the Supreme Court have agreed the loss of innocent lives in the aftermath of the fatal escape of Methyl Isocynate (MIC) gas from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984 was “horrific” in every sense.\n“A long history of litigation attempting to recover damages from the U.S.-headquartered Union Carbide Corporation (now part of Dow Chemicals Corporation) ended with the dismissal by the Supreme Court of the curative petitions in July 2023 wherein it was made clear that any shortfall in compensation to be paid to the victims were a responsibility of the Union government,” the petition said.\nThe organisations said they had data to show that survivors suffering from cancer and kidney failure as a result of toxic gas exposure were classified under the category of ‘minor/temporary injury’.\n“All these cases ought to have been added as a permanent disability category. Even as far back as in 1974, Union Carbide’s internal document, titled MIC Plant Safety Considerations Report, had very clearly stated that in cases of inhalation of MIC ‘major residual injury is likely in spite of prompt treatment’... This petition seeks to enforce that responsibility of the Union government, pointing out a certain category of cases in which the damages awarded and paid to be manifestly unjust and arbitrary,” the organisation submitted.\nThe case was listed for hearing before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai on July 14. However, the Bench did not assemble due to the inavailability of the Chief Justice. The case status shows the next date as July 18. The petitioners are represented by senior advocate S. Muralidhar and advocate Prasanna S.\nFocusing the extent of the disaster’s impact on public health even decades later, the petition said records of the hospitals run by the government show that “more than 30 years after the disaster, 95% of the population officially acknowledged to have been exposed to the toxic gas required hospital visits for their medical needs”.\n“Data from the Central government-run hospital show that the incidence of heart ailments, neurology disorders, gastro and kidney ailments, psychiatric disorders and other chronic diseases is very high among gas-exposed patients. Records from eight community health units of the ICMR-run Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre [BMHRC] in Bhopal from 1998 to 2016 show that 50.4% of gas-affected patients suffer from cardiovascular problems and 59.6% suffer from pulmonary problems… In 2023 alone 2,06,016 gas victims visited the BMHRC,” the plea submitted."

Municipal officials had earlier convened a meeting to coordinate the drive, followed by specialised training for HKS members.\nThe training focused on handling recyclables and hazardous components, adhering to safety protocols during transport, understanding e-waste valuation, and managing environmental consequences, said a senior official of the Clean Kerala Company.\nHe said the e-waste collected by the Haritha Karma Sena will be handed over to the Clean Kerala Company. Based on the quantity and type of waste gathered, the company will pay HKS, which will in turn pay the amount to the people, he added. The official added that the company has yet to finalise rates for certain categories of e-waste and has not furnished details on the amount to be paid.\nSo far, the company has recovered 59 tonnes of recyclable e-waste and 210 kg of hazardous material from government establishments alone, he said.\nThe campaign was launched through ward-level inaugurations. In Kasaragod, Municipal Chairperson Abbas Begum flagged off the drive in Nellikunnu ward. In Nileswaram, Chairperson T.V. Shantha launched the collection from Cherappuram ward, while in Kanhangad, Chairperson K.V. Sujatha inaugurated the drive at Ward 17, Alamipally."

    "content": "Following the recent revision in autorickshaw fares set to take effect from the coming month, several Bengaluru commuters have raised concerns about the lack of transparency in fare breakup on popular aggregator apps such as Uber, Ola, and Rapido. Users complain that these apps fail to show detailed fare components either before or after the ride, leaving them unsure about what exactly they are being charged for.\nThe Bengaluru Urban district administration announced a fare hike on July 14, revising the base fare for autos from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km, and the per-km charge from ₹15 to ₹18 thereafter. The revised fares will come into effect from August 1.\nHowever, commuters argue that aggregator apps already charge significantly higher than the meter fare, often due to vague policies like ‘tips’, ‘congestion fee’, ‘platform fees’, ‘driver addition’, etc. Now, with the new fares looming, the lack of a clear fare breakup has only added to their frustration.\n“I booked an auto for a short ride recently and was charged ₹97. I had no idea how that fare was calculated. There was no breakup shown, just a final amount. If we are being asked to pay more, at least we should know what we are paying for,” said Sushmitha Rao, a resident of Jayanagar.\n“I don’t know what exactly these apps are charging for, and it is unethical not to give a fare breakup. The fare often feels arbitrary, and there’s no way to check if it’s fair,” said Rajeev Kumar, a daily commuter from Koramangala.\nThe Hindureached out to multiple aggregators for a response, but at the time of publication, none of the platforms had responded.\nAuto aggregator platform Namma Yatri has rolled back its revised autorickshaw fares following a report published byThe Hindu, titled “Aggregator begins charging revised auto fares before they come into effect, draws criticism from commuters”, dated July 17  . The platform had begun charging the new fares  a fortnight ahead of the official implementation date set by the government\nNamma Yatri had earlier clarified that the revised fare display was not a full rollout, but part of a limited pilot to test system readiness and gather driver-citizen feedback ahead of the official implementation. “Namma Yatri has always been, and continues to be, a community-driven platform. Our ethos is simple: commuters should pay less, and drivers should earn more. ,” said a Namma Yatri spokesperson."

The FIR was registered based on a complaint by Vijayalakshmi, the mother of the deceased, who witnessed the murder on July 15.\nAccording to the complainant, on July 15, around 8.10 p.m., a group of unidentified assailants attacked Shivaprakash when he was standing outside their house at Bharathinagar with his driver Imran Khan and friend Lokesh. When Imran Khan tried to rescue Shivaprakash, he was also attacked. She said she saw Lokesh filming the attack on his mobile phone. She screamed for help, and seeing people rush to the spot, the assailants fled, but by then, Shivaprakash was dead, the complainant said.\nThe complainant also said that Shivaparakash had been engaged in the real estate business, as part of Extreme Point (Promoters and Developers) Private Limited, for the past year. She said her son had gotten a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for a plot of land at Kothanur in 2023. He had built a shed and arranged for two women to live there as security guards. Then in February 2025, two men — Jagadish alias Jagga and Kiran — trespassed into the plot of land and threw out the two women living there. Ms. Vijayalakshmi claimed that later, Jagadish called Shivaparakash, threatening to ‘not let him be alive’ if he doesn’t transfer the GPA to his name, as it was “his area”.\nShivaprakash had also complained about the threats to the police. According to the FIR, he was allegedly murdered by eight persons who were instigated by the MLA for K.R. Puram, Byrathi Basavaraj. Mr. MLA Basavaraj has been listed as accused number five in the case."

    "content": "The Congress party has strongly criticised the removal of a stone plaque commemorating the 2015 inauguration of a children’s park and sea walkway in Payyambalam by the then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, calling it an act of disrespect and political opportunism.\nThe stone plaque, originally installed after the project’s inauguration on May 15, 2015, was reportedly removed and replaced with a new one naming current Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas as the inaugurator. The removed plaque, which bore Mr. Chandy’s name, was allegedly found discarded in a dustbin with a broom placed over it.\nDistrict Congress Committee President Martin George condemned the move, calling it “the worst mistake,” and demanded an immediate inquiry to determine who ordered the removal.\nHe pointed out that several tourism projects were undertaken in Kannur during Chandy’s tenure as Chief Minister and A.P. Anilkumar’s term as Tourism Minister, and accused the current government of trying to appropriate past achievements.\nCongress workers have since retrieved and placed the original plaque at the park’s entrance. The party warned that if it is removed again, it will be reinstated. Mr. George also said the move amounted to insulting a former Chief Minister and undermining the democratic tradition of preserving public memory."

Gadkari and Neela Gokhale held that the UAPA, in its current form, is constitutionally sound. The Court rejected the 2021 petition filed by Anil Baburao Baile, 46, a Mumbai resident, who was issued a notice by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in July 2020.\nMr. Baile had challenged the validity of the UAPA and amended it up-to-date, and section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, and prayed for a declaration of these laws asultra viresand unconstitutional; and to quash and set aside the NIA notice issued to him. He said that the meaning of “unlawful activists”, “terrorist”, and “sedition” needs to be examined. “Nowhere in Chapter IV of UAPA ‘Terrorist’ is defined; what is defined is Terrorist Act in section 15. The word ‘Unlawful Activities’ is defined in section 2(o) of the said act, and ‘Sedition’ is defined in section 124A of the IPC,” the petition said.\nMr. Baile further argued that the amendments made to UAPA—especially those incorporating the 2001 UN Security Council resolution on international terrorism—enabled the government to arbitrarily designate Indian citizens or organisations as terrorists without adequate safeguards or definitions.\n“Nowhere does the Constitution authorise a blanket power to the executive in deciding, and Parliament cannot be granted blanket power to declare an organisation as unlawful,” the petition contended.\nThe Bench found no merit in the arguments and concluded that the provisions of the Act met constitutional muster and dismissed the petition. A detailed order is yet to be uploaded."

    "content": "The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) on Thursday (July 17, 2025) informed the Bombay High Court that it would take a decision within two working days on the certification applications filed by the makers of a film, inspired by the life of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\nA Division Bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale, while hearing a petition filed by Samrat Cinematics India Pvt. Ltd, expressed displeasure over the delay in certification and questioned the board’s failure to act within the prescribed timelines under the Cinematograph Act and the new Certification Rules, 2024.\nThe filmmakers moved the High Court alleging “arbitrary and unexplained” inaction by the CBFC though the application for certification of the film ‘Ajey: The Untold Story of a Yogi’ as well as its teaser, trailer and promotional song was made on June 5. The film, inspired by the book ‘The Monk Who Became Chief Minister’, is scheduled for release on August 1.\nRepresenting the petitioner, senior advocate Ravi Kadam pointed out the CBFC’s purported demand for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister’s Office, asserting that there is no mention of such a requirement in the Cinematograph Act, 1952 or the Certification Rules, 2024.\nThe CBFC’s counsel submitted to the Bench that they will consider the application within two working days and communicate the same, on the same day or the next day.\nThe court recorded the submission and observed, “The petitioner essentially seeks direction from CBFC to decide certification within a period not exceeding five days. A letter sent to applicant intimating the same is taken on record. In view of the statement that the process will be completed and the application will be decided, nothing survives in the petition. The decision taken by the CBFC has to be intimated on the same day. Petition is disposed of.”\nThe petitioners said they initially submitted their application for certification on June 5. Under Rule 37 of the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024, the CBFC is obligated to examine the application within seven days and schedule a screening within 15 days. However, no action was taken for nearly a month, prompting further steps from the petitioners.\nOn July 3, following advice from CBFC officials, the filmmakers re-applied under the ‘priority scheme’ and paid three times the usual fee as stipulated under Rule 33(2). Although a screening was slated for July 7, it was cancelled abruptly a day before, with no explanation or follow-up communication.\nWhen the filmmakers checked the application status on July 12, they found it marked as “Incomplete” with an unclear instruction to “Provide Documentary Evidence”, without any specifics on what documents were required.\nThe petition alleged that the CBFC’s conduct was arbitrary and had resulted in serious commercial and reputational damage, especially with the film’s August 1 release date looming.\nThe filmmakers also pointed out that the film draws inspiration from the widely circulated 2017 book ‘The Monk Who Became Chief Minister’ by Shantanu Gupta, which has been translated into 12 languages and is publicly available. The petition noted that the book had received an official endorsement from the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister’s Office and that the film offers a respectful and fact-based depiction of the Chief Minister’s public life.\nArguing that the CBFC’s delays and opaque conduct infringed upon their constitutional rights, the petitioners invoked Articles 14, 19(1)(a), 19(1)(g), and 21 of the Constitution, citing violations of their rights to equality, free speech, profession, and personal liberty."

    "content": "India has cautioned against “double standards”, even as U.S. lawmakers consider a Bill that would impose 500% duties on India and other countries buying Russian oil.\nThe Ministry of External Affairs’ comments comes after indications that U.S. President Donald Trump is backing the Russian Sanctions Act, introduced by a closely-allied Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, and even threatened secondary tariffs of 100% on countries that continue trade on sanctioned Russian products.\nOn Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who met with Mr. Trump and members of the U.S. Congress, also issued a threat, in particular to China, India and Brazil, who are among the top buyers of Russian crude oil, oil products, and coal. Mr. Rutte said “Beijing and Delhi” should push Russian President Vladimir Putin towards ending the war in Ukraine, or face tariffs.\nResponding to questions on the issue on Thursday, the MEA said it was following the developments “closely”. “Securing the energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us. In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n“We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added, in a possible reference to the fact that European Union members continue to procure oil, LNG and pipeline gas from Russia despite the sanctions, and are also major buyers of processed products that go through Indian refineries, including Gujarat’s Nayara Energies, which has minority control by Russia’s ROSNEFT. However, while Russia sells about half its oil exports to China, and about 38% to India (as of February 2025), it exports only about 6% to EU countries.\nAt an industry event in Delhi on Thursday, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri said thatIndia would “deal” with sanctionswhen they are passed, pointing out that India has diversified its supply sources, buying oil from about 40 countries now, as opposed to 27 in the past. However, despite requests from Tehran, India has not so far reversed a decision taken under pressure from the first Trump administration in 2017, to stop all oil imports from Iran.\nThe latest comments from the government come as lawmakers in the U.S. prepare to go forward with the Russian Sanctions Act, 2025 that has been introduced in the House and Senate, with 87 and 84 co-sponsors respectively, cutting across party lines. Section 17 of the Act proposes to impose 500%ad valoremduties on countries that buy, sell or transfer “oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products, or petrochemical products that originated in the Russian Federation”.\nIn Washington on July 2, External Affairs MinisterS. Jaishankar had confirmed that India’s “concerns” about the Billand “interests in energy security” had been conveyed to Mr. Graham who, along with Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal, is sponsoring the Bill. Mr. Graham has said that he believes Mr. Trump supports the law which would give him the power to waive the duties for a period of six months. However, the Republican lawmaker has urged the U.S. President to impose the sanctions earlier than the 50-day deadline proposed at present.\nThe proposed sanctions further complicate ties between New Delhi and Washington, who are currently putting the last touches on a ‘mini’ trade deal that officials say will be completed “soon”. Amidst intense negotiations over tariffs, as well as market access to India, particularly in the areas of agriculture, dairy and genetically modified produce, New Delhi has also been coordinating with the U.S. government about the deportation of Indians illegally resident in the U.S.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Jaiswal said that 1,563 Indian nationals have been deported in the first six months of Mr. Trump’s second tenure, from January 20 to July 15 this year. According to ICE statistics, 1,529 immigration violators were deported in all of 2024, and far less than in the three preceding years. After protests in India over the first few batches of deportees being handcuffed and shackled on board military flights in February this year, the U.S. agreed to send Indians back by commercially chartered flights, including as recently as last week."

    "content": "On Thursday (July 17, 2025), theThalassemiaPatients Advocacy Group (TPAG), along with legal and health experts, called for the need to strengthen blood safety practices across the country – particularly the need for a standardised test to screen blood donations – to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections.\nFollowing the discussion, held at India International Centre in Delhi on Thursday (July 17, 2025), the group said they would be submitting their recommendations to stakeholders including state and central governments.\nA 23-year-old Thalassemia patient fromKolkata, present during the discussion, shared her experience of contracting dengue and then testing positive for HIV, to which lack of blood screening could have contributed.\nShe said, “From the age of two, I have been taking blood transfusions. As a Thalassemia patient, I would require it every 21 days. When I was in Class 8, I contracted dengue and then tested positive with HIV. I don’t know for sure if I got it during the blood transfusion or not, but the testing has an important role to play.”\nAt present, Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), a highly sensitive molecular technique used to screen blood donations for infectious diseases, is used in some hospitals. While it is treated as a gold standard, it is not mandatory across the country.\nTuhin A. Sinha, a BJP spokesperson present during the discussion vowed to the group that he would help them take the dialogue forward. Speaking about the importance of NAT testing, he said, “The Delhi government hospitals have been quick to ensure that it is in place. But one of the important steps should be to develop advocacy for implementing it across the country.”\nHe also suggested incentivising blood donations, saying, “The more people join the ecosystem, either by way of espousing the idea of donating blood, it will lead to the institutionalisation of systems where checks and balances can be implemented more aggressively.”\nThe discussion was moderated by Anubha Taneja Mukherjee, Member Secretary of TPAG, which is a network of over 10,000 thalassemia patients in the country. She said, “Based on today’s discussion, we will send recommendations to stakeholders including the government, and government agencies.”\nThe recommendations included standardised blood transfusion practises and a mandate for NAT, a national-level blood donation campaign involving influencers, mandatory thalassemia screening for pregnant women. She added that in an attempt to reduce dependence on blood transfusion, hospitals should also make available, novel therapies such as gene therapy.\nDuring the discussion, P.C. Sen, a Supreme Court advocate, spoke about the legal and ethical responsibilities of the state and institutions to ensure pathogen-free blood as a constitutional right. Meanwhile, Professor N.K. Ganguly, former Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested an approach that would also involve patients of other blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia."

    "content": "After the film industry, the government plans to take forward efforts to prevent harassment of women in the workplace to the TV serial sector too.\nInaugurating a two-day workshop on ‘Strengthening institutional mechanisms combating violence against women and girls’ organised by the Kochi-based Centre for Public Policy and Research (CPPR) in association with the U.S. Consulate General, Chennai, in the State capital on Thursday, Women and Child Development (WCD) Director Haritha V. Kumar said initiatives had been taken to understand how provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) [POSH] Act, 2013, were applicable to the film sector. As part of this, first round of trainings had been held for all stakeholders.\nAfter the TV serial sector, the government would focus on applicability of POSH Act in the gig sector. It would explore how gig workers could raise a complaint of sexual harassment and they could be empowered to raise it.\nThe WCD Director said though internal committees (IC) had been set up in many places, the State had not been able to universalise them. ICs had been set up in government departments and offices. Now, trainings were being conducted for IC members in Technopark, Cyberpark, and SmartCity.\nShe said the government was planning outcome assessments to understand how allocations for gender concerns in the Budget were translating into results.\nShe called for deliberations on how to fast-track proceedings in domestic violence and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) cases to ensure justice and privacy for the survivors.\nS. Ajeetha Begum, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thiruvananthapuram range, in her address, said the issue of patriarchy as well as socio-cultural norms had to be addressed to combat the violence.\nDespite strong laws, conviction rates remained low. For instance, in POCSO cases the conviction rate was around 16%. Again, there was only one woman protection officer for the entire district of Thiruvananthapuram. This highlighted the need to strengthen institutional mechanisms to protect women and children. Focus also had to be on rehabilitation and reintegration of survivors into society, the DIG said.\nGita Gopal, special adviser on gender at the CPPR, said despite the large number of crimes that were registered in the State, more than 30% of the cases were pending in fast-track courts, in contrast to 60% in Bihar.\nIt also had to be examined if the laws were survivor-centric.\nShe called for measuring outcomes of institutions and laws to bring about policy changes and stressed the need to follow-up on survivors of violence.\nAnjali Prasad Guntur, director of programmes, Raksha Inc, Georgia, U.S. spoke about best practices in the U.S. on combating violence against women and girls.\nK.C. Rosakutty, chairperson, Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation Ltd.; S.N. Raghuchandran Nair, president of the Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and D. Dhanuraj, chairperson of the CPPR, spoke. A message by Jeanne M. Briganti, Public Affairs Officer, U.S. Consulate General, Chennai, was screened on the occasion.\nThe workshop will conclude on Friday."

Gadkari and Neela Gokhale held that the UAPA, in its current form, is constitutionally sound. The Court rejected the 2021 petition filed by Anil Baburao Baile, 46, a Mumbai resident, who was issued a notice by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in July 2020.\nMr. Baile had challenged the validity of the UAPA and amended it up-to-date, and section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, and prayed for a declaration of these laws asultra viresand unconstitutional; and to quash and set aside the NIA notice issued to him. He said that the meaning of “unlawful activists”, “terrorist”, and “sedition” needs to be examined. “Nowhere in Chapter IV of UAPA ‘Terrorist’ is defined; what is defined is Terrorist Act in section 15. The word ‘Unlawful Activities’ is defined in section 2(o) of the said act, and ‘Sedition’ is defined in section 124A of the IPC,” the petition said.\nMr. Baile further argued that the amendments made to UAPA—especially those incorporating the 2001 UN Security Council resolution on international terrorism—enabled the government to arbitrarily designate Indian citizens or organisations as terrorists without adequate safeguards or definitions.\n“Nowhere does the Constitution authorise a blanket power to the executive in deciding, and Parliament cannot be granted blanket power to declare an organisation as unlawful,” the petition contended.\nThe Bench found no merit in the arguments and concluded that the provisions of the Act met constitutional muster and dismissed the petition. A detailed order is yet to be uploaded."

That’s exactly what the Crazy Creations drama troupe is aiming for. They have also begun conducting shows for large communities in their auditoriums, and so far, it has been a laugh riot for both the audiences and the cast.\nMaadhu Balaji, who leads the popular 47-year-old Tamil theatre troupe, said they had been trying out this format for over a month now, and the response had been encouraging. “People prefer not to travel these days due to the traffic and want easier access to entertainment. The idea came about when Sriram from Australia wanted us to perform our play at a function in a restaurant, and invited his friends and family. The experience was unique. It took us to the past, when we only had microphones and an audience and did not bother about the backdrop or anything else. Since that one, we have had several opportunities to perform at various places,” he said.\nOf the several staged at corporate centres, one was performed at UPS India Technology Centre. Venkatesh Kasturirangan, associate director, explains how it came about. “Parents often don’t get the chance to see where their children work. So, we decided to invite them over on parents’ day, and give them a glimpse into our world. Behind every employee is a family, who shaped their journey and supported them all along.” To top it all, Crazy Creations troupe’s performance had the parents in splits and made the afternoon one to remember.\nThe troupe has managed to keep the plays simple. Malthy Simha, clinical psychologist and resident of Adyar, recalls how the troupe made her husband’s birthday special. “Mr. Balaji asked only for a sofa set. He even gave me a role saying it would be a surprise for my husband. Everyone enjoyed it.”\nActor and theatre personality Crazy Mohan’s plays, includingChocolate Krishna, Marriage Made in Saloon, Meesai Aanaalum Manaivi,andAllaudin and100 Watts Bulbare being tailor-made to suit the audiences. For details, call Mr. Balaji on 98410 49386 or G. Srinivasan on 94440 27202."

    "content": "Retired Supreme Court judge Justice V. Gopala Gowda, addressing media persons on Thursday, demanded a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe, monitored by either a sitting or retired judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, into the Dharmasthala case.\nJustice Gowda said the complainant, who had recorded his statement before the magistrate, was already facing pressure from the police. “Police are allegedly coercing him to mark the places he has buried the bodies on a white paper. Also, the statement of the whistleblower is being leaked to private individuals,” he said.\nHe further said that even days after the whistleblower lodged a complaint and recorded his statement before a magistrate, the police seem to be in no hurry to organise the exhumation of these remains. The police have not even visited the spot. This raises serious questions about the intentions of the current investigation,” he said, demanding the constitution of an SIT led by an Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) rank officer, monitored by a sitting/retired judge of the Supreme Court or High Court.\nJustice Gowda further warned the Home Minister, Director General, and Inspector General of the Police that they would be held responsible if the whistleblower and his advocates were harmed in any manner.\nSenior advocate and Congress leader C.S. Dwarkanath expressed concern over the whistleblowers’ statement being leaked and said that they had already written to the Home Minister to take steps to plug the leaks."

During a gate meeting held at Koyambedu, they said that only half of the office had been shifted to the rented building from the old structure, for which they pay a rent of ₹40 lakh per month. The government had recently announced ₹2 crore towards the restoration of the heritage structure. “We want the entire operations to be shifted back to our own building,” they said.\nSoma. Azhagiri, general secretary of the Union, said that the government must provide a pension for civil supplies employees. “We also seek permanent jobs for procurement clerks, watchmen, and helpers at procurement centres. This can be done by filling up the vacancies in the department. Those who have joined in 2012 have still not been made permanent.”"

    "content": "NEW DELHI\nIndia on Thursday (July 17, 2025) reiterated that the next election of Bangladesh should be “inclusive” and have “everybody in its fold”. The official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs commented on the election a day after student leaders of the interim government-backed National Citizens Party (NCP) clashed with cadres of the Awami League in the latter’s stronghold of Gopalganj, which houses the memorial of Bangladesh’s founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n“On elections in Bangladesh, you know our point of view. We have said that as a democracy we would welcome holding of elections, that is inclusive and includes everybody in its fold,” said official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\nThe clashes in Gopalganj occurred after NCP leaders arrived outside the memorial of Sheikh Mujib, which is guarded by Awami League activists. On May 10, the interim government banned political activities by the Awami League. Earlier, the student wing of the Awami League, Chhatra League, was banned in October 2024. Chief Adviser Prof. Mohammed Yunus, in his Eid speech delivered on June 6, said that elections in Bangladesh would be held in April 2026, stating, “This election would witness participation of the largest number of people and political parties.”\nThe clash in Gopalganj has demonstrated that, despite the ban, the Awami League has remained active on the ground, especially in its traditional strongholds. The violence and subsequent police firing claimed at least four lives, with both sides giving conflicting reports.\nIn a press statement, the interim government announced that a committee has been formed to investigate the violence in Gopalganj. Sources in the Awami League countered the interim government by circulating an audio statement purportedly by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in which she condemned the interim government and accused the NCP of extortion and violence."

    "content": "Measuring success is complicated; assessing the impact of one’s action can be even more challenging. The desire to be successful is different from the desperation to demonstrate success.\nStakeholders have different yardsticks for measuring performance depending on their interest leaving the vital question “how does one measure one’s own success?” The Election Commission of India (ECI) could perhaps be in a trilemma in the wake of its June 24, 2025 announcement of its Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls in Bihar, caught among political parties, citizens, the judiciary, and its own conscience.\nOnce again, it finds itself in an avoidable imbroglio, responding to the judiciary’s questions arising out of the justified anxiety of millions of electors, valid apprehensions of neutral observers and unverified suspicion of political interest groups.\nWhy has ECI initiated SIR of Bihar’s electoral rolls? | Explained\nFencing out the voter in Bihar’s poll roll preparation\nThe Election Commission of India does not have unfettered powers\nWhat the ‘neutral clean-up’ of Bihar’s poll rolls really is\nThe dark signs of restricted or selective franchise\nThe ECI embarked on a seemingly laudable and perfectly legal exercise to purify electoral rolls, declaring its resolve to include all “eligible” and exclude “ineligible” persons. The underlying assumption was that some “ineligible” people had infiltrated the electoral rolls, escaping detection during its due process of documentary and physical scrutiny that Electoral Registration Officers carry out before listing anyone in the electoral rolls. Even the mandatory periodic revisions could not filter them out over the years. No one could possibly object to this effort, however formidable the task. Yet, the ECI found itself facing a barrage of opposition from political parties and civil society organisations for undertaking this mammoth exercise and imposing an impossible demand on clueless citizens in Bihar as they prepare to exercise their most powerful right — of electing their representatives. It is akin to asking for a marriage certificate after years of happy married life with children as proof of a legal union.\nTo be sure, if there is one organisation in the country that is capable of carrying out gigantic exercises, it would, without doubt, be the ECI. From preparing the first electoral rolls in the 1950s in trying circumstances, to updating the rolls necessitated by the reorganisation of States in 1956 when it was suggested that the term of the House be extended to allow the ECI enough time to revise the rolls. The ECI did not want a constitutional amendment because of its inability to complete a mandatory requirement and lived up to the challenge. Since then, it has repeatedly demonstrated its capabilities in handling mega tasks with astounding success.\nWhether it is enrolling a billion people or setting up a million polling stations, mobilising over 18 lakh polling officials for conducting elections and training them, or dealing with moving 30 lakh electronic voting machines, the ECI has done it with aplomb, ably supported by the government machinery. In the process, it has earned the gratitude of an entire country and the envy of democracies across the world. Countries that may have the spirit but not the systems have often looked upon the ECI as a model in creating standard operating procedures, in galvanising resources, and its effective consultative approach in building consensus among political parties.\nThis has earned the ECI the trust of voters and imparted it a credibility that has been acknowledged by the media, supported by civil society organisations and earned it the respect of the judiciary. Indeed, some have referred to it as “gold standard”, belying the cynics who believe that “all that glitters is not gold.”\nIt is in this backdrop that the sudden announcement by the ECI to carry out a purge of the Bihar electoral rolls has invited unpleasant reactions. As opponents question the ECI’s motives of raising the spectre of mass disenfranchisement, the ECI is in overdrive trying to demonstrate the ease with which this apparently unwieldy operation involving nearly eight crore registered electors in Bihar is being completed.\nMeanwhile, it has eased some stringent procedures, allowing those enrolled after 2003 to use the entries of their parents in the 2003 electoral rolls to support their citizenship claim. It has also allowed Booth Level Officers (BLO) to accept enumeration forms without the prescribed document to prove the eligibility of the post-2003 electors. The relaxations by the ECI obviously ramped up the daily submission of enumeration forms giving the ECI the basis for claiming success of its operations and the ‘support’ of the affected electors. This, supposedly, would deflate the clamour of the complainants and perhaps convince the higher judiciary that the political sound and fury signifies nothing.\nIt, however, remains unclear how the BLOs will “recommend” for inclusion in the draft roll such electors whose forms are not accompanied by documents and how the Electoral Registration Officer/Assistant Electoral Registration Officer decides their eligibility in the absence of those documents. Will the ECI ask such electors to provide the proof of their eligibility/citizenship after the draft roll is published on August 1? If it agrees to expand the list of prescribed documents, as suggested by the Supreme Court of India (to consider the Aadhaar card, Electoral Photo Identity Card, or EPIC and ration card), will it not simply amount to verification of identity, and not citizenship? Are we then not back to square one?\nWill the indicator of the ECI’s success be the number of “duly filled” forms submitted along with “self-attested documents” and electors readmitted to the rolls that were supposed to be purified? Or, will its success be the number of “ineligible” electors disenfranchised? Those who are dead, who have migrated or have enrolled twice should have been weeded out in the normal course. Did their exclusion warrant this extraordinary exercise?\nBy ascribing presumption of citizenship to the electors in the 2003 list, is the ECI claiming that after its current SIR, all those in the electoral rolls will be accepted by the government as citizens as in the Citizenship Act and no one’s credentials will hereafter be questioned? Is the government willing to accept this presumption?\nNo individual is responsible for being born where she is, nor for creating documentary evidence of the date and place of her birth, parentage or citizenship. The authority empowered by the law is. Like many countries, India too has a law under which it is not the ECI that is designated as the competent authority: at least not as yet. However, broad the ECI’s shoulders are, they may not be strong enough to carry someone else’s burden.\nLet us see for whom the bell tolls in Bihar.\nAshok Lavasa is former Election Commissioner and Union Finance Secretary of India"

The initiative also included a diode laser transpupillary thermotherapy unit - a laser machine to treat eye tumours, a new tonometer for measuring eye pressure, as well as a selective laser trabeculoplasty software to treat glaucoma, the second most common cause of preventable blindness.\nIn his address, Vikram Mathews, Director, CMC Vellore, said that retinoblastoma is a curable cancer when diagnosed early and treated promptly. “With this state-of-the-art equipment, CMC will be able to double the number of patients being benefited. CMC is the only hospital for a 140 km radius around Vellore that offers this service,” he said.\nHimanshu Nivsarkar of Kotak Mahindra Bank said that access to quality healthcare should be a right, especially for children battling life-threatening conditions like eye cancer. “Through the partnership with CMC, the bank will help to transform the lives of young patients and their families,” he said.\nThe initiative supports the procurement of an advanced life support (ICU) ambulance to facilitate seamless inter-hospital transfers for the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) of CMC. The CMC’s EMS doctors, paramedics, and nurses cater to around 1,000 critically-ill adult and paediatric patients every month, the release said."

It has two checkposts — one maintained by the district police and the other by the transport department separately.\nThe search lasted for five hours between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Thursday. The surprise check comes after similar searches were carried out by the DVAC, in which unaccounted cash was seized at the Sub-Registrar office in Velapadi in Vellore recently.\nThe two teams, comprising four officials each, were led by DVAC inspector Mythili, conducted the surprise check at the check post. “Such surprise checks do happen regularly. Before going for such checks, we ensure that we verify our alerts with multiple sources,” said a DVAC official.\nThe significance of conducting the surprise check early in the morning, DVAC officials said, was that transport staff changed their shift around that time with their collections. They also said the check post witnesses more goods-laden lorries during early hours of the day, especially from neighbouring States like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to reach Chennai, Tiruvannamalai and Puducherry.\nThese vehicles rush through the check posts at Christianpet near Vellore to avoid traffic snarls at industrial zones in Sriperumbudur and Irungattukottai areas in Kancheepuram. It is also a key route for Tirupati-bound buses from Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet and neighbouring districts.\nAfter more than three decades of its formation, the police check post at Christianpet got a permanent building. The check post is fitted with two high powered Automatic Number-Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to prevent smuggling of banned products and crime."

The impact of bandh was visible in major cities such as Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Balasore, and Bhadrak.\nTrains and long-distance buses were stopped at several places, leading to long delays and inconvenience for commuters. At some places protesters blocked the roads by burning tyres and parked their vehicles in order to stop vehicular movement. Vehicles associated with essential services, including ambulances, were allowed free passage.\n“We express our gratitude to the people of Odisha for cooperating with the peaceful bandh. We are fighting for a bigger cause as Odisha is witnessing increasing incidents of violence against women. If we don’t raise our voice now, the situation will worsen further,” said Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee President Bhakta Charan Das.\n“We have demanded the resignation of the Higher Education Minister[Suryabanshi Suraj], the Balasore MP [Pratap Chandra Sarangi], and the Balasore Sadar MLA [Manas Dutta]. The unprecedented public support for today’s bandh clearly indicates that the Mohan Majhi government has lost the moral right to govern,” said Suresh Panigrahi, CPI (M) State secretary.\nMeanwhile, an assistant professor of a government university was arrested in Sambalpur for allegedly sexually exploiting a 20-year-old student, the police said.\nOn the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman, the Sambalpur Mahila Police Station registered a case and arrested the accused, said an officer.\nFurther investigation is under way, the officer said.\nThe accused has been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by a court here, another official said.\n(With inputs from PTI)\n(Those in distress may contact Sanjivini, Society for Mental Health suicide prevention helpline: 011-40769002.)"

    "content": "The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the West Bengal government to file an affidavit within two weeks on the resumption of student union elections and urged the State to issue a notification to initiate the election process promptly.\nThe verbal order was given during a hearing of a 2023 public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Sayan Banerjee. In the PIL, Mr. Banerjee had petitioned for the resumption of student union elections across public universities in West Bengal, as well as the reinstatement of anti-ragging committees.\nNotably, student union elections came to a halt across higher education institutions in West Bengal a little before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Earlier this year, students of Jadavpur University staged protests demanding holding of elections, which have been withheld in the institution for five years.\n“This is a positive step towards the restoration of a democratic atmosphere in the State’s higher education institutes. Student union elections must be expedited. Without that various problems have arisen, including the unchecked reign of terror by former office-bearers. Many of them have graduated but continue to exert their influence on college campuses as outsiders,” Mr. Banerjee told The Hindu.\nHe added that in response to the government’s counsel stating that many higher education institutions currently do not have a Vice-Chancellor (V-C), the court urged the State to begin elections in universities where a V-C is present.\nEarlier this month, hearing another PIL by Mr. Banerjee, the High Court had directed the State government to lock up union rooms in colleges where there was no recognised student body or where student union elections had not taken place recently.\n“The State government is willing to conduct student union elections, and politically, the student wing of Trinamool is ready for fresh union polls. However, for various challenges like the pandemic and the change in the semester system in colleges due to the National Education Policy 2020, the State hasn’t been able to conduct elections so far,” Trinamool Congress spokesperson Debangshu Bhattacharya said.\nThe court on Thursday also observed that the governing bodies of higher education institutions in the State should be freed from political influence and should include renowned academicians.\nCurrently, several Trinamool leaders are part of the governing bodies of many public universities.\nNotably, Trinamool MLA Ashok Deb heads the governing body of South Calcutta Law College, where Monojit Mishra, an ex-student and a temporary employee, has been accused of raping a student. Mishra also had strong ties to the ruling dispensation.\n“In various State commissions, the West Bengal government has tried to minimise political influence by appointing renowned public intellectuals to head them. In case of governing bodies in educational institutions, I believe there is no harm in including Trinamool leaders who have been academics in the past, like Bratya Basu and Saugata Ray. They understand administration, the pulse of common students, and also have experience in academia,” Mr. Bhattacharya said."

    "content": "The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday (July 17, 2025) directed the Inspector-General of Police (South Zone) and the Madurai Commissioner of Police to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by a senior IPS officer with proven integrity, to conduct an investigation into the alleged property tax scam in the Madurai Corporation.\nA Division Bench of Justices S.M. Subramaniam and A.D. Maria Clete sought a report from authorities while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by AIADMK Councillor T. Ravi (ward 83) of Madurai, who sought the transfer of the probe into the alleged scam to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The petitioner said that last year, information regarding the alleged scam surfaced in which several persons had benefited. Based on a complaint given to the Madurai Corporation Commissioner, a committee had been constituted to detect any irregularities.\nAfter receiving the report of the committee, the Corporation Commissioner lodged a complaint with the Madurai City Commissioner of Police. The scam, which occurred between 2022 and 2024, had caused a loss of around ₹200 crore to the civic body, the petitioner alleged.\nThough the complaint was lodged by the Corporation Commissioner in 2024, a case was registered only in 2025, after about seven months. There was a long delay in registering the case, he said, adding that action was being taken against the low-profile persons and not the real culprits.\nDuring the course of the hearing, it was contended that persons with political connections were involved in the scam, and as per the instructions of the Chief Minister, the Zonal Chairpersons had resigned from their posts.\nThe court said a scam of this magnitude had to be investigated by an IPS officer, and the probe should be monitored by higher authorities to ensure that there were no lapses, and that no one was left out of the ambit of prosecution. All those responsible for causing the huge loss to the civic body should be prosecuted, the court said, and posted the matter next week for further hearing."

    "content": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Thursday (July 17, 2025) that India had sent an “unambiguous” message to the world that any attempt to harm its citizens would invite retaliation. “In contrast, the country faced terror attacks almost every day during Congress rule,” he said.\nMr. Shah, who also holds the Cooperative portfolio in the Union Cabinet, was addressing a cooperative and employment festival, marking International Cooperatives Year-2025, at Dadiya village near Jaipur. He referred toOperation Sindoor, affirming that it had eliminated terrorists based in Pakistan.\n“When the Uri attack occurred, [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi took decisive action by carrying out the surgical strike. After the Pulwama attack, an airstrike was ordered. After the attack in Pahalgam, Operation Sindoor was sanctioned, which targeted terrorists across the border,” Mr. Shah said.\nMr. Shah said the country had become the fourth largest economy under Mr. Modi’s leadership, while 22 crore people had been lifted above the poverty line. The vision of a “prosperous and secure nation” had been turned into a reality under the present dispensation, he added.\nMeanwhile, veteran Congress leader and former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday asked Mr. Shah to clarify why the trial in Udaipur tailor Kanhaiya Lal’s murder case was not making headway after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the matter. Two cleaver-wielding men had murdered Mr. Lal in June 2022, when Mr. Gehlot was the CM.\nMr. Gehlot said at a press conference here, ahead of Mr. Shah’s address at the event, that though the State police had apprehended the accused within four hours of the incident, NIA took over the case overnight. “Three years later, even the statements [of witnesses] have not been recorded in the court,” he said.\nMr. Shah praised Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma for launching public welfare and development works and said the BJP government in the State had taken strong action against paper leaks in recruitment exams by forming a Special Investigation Team.\nHe also pointed to the cooperative sector’s contribution to development and said it was playing an active role in 98% of rural areas. The Ministry of Cooperation had launched 61 initiatives in the last four years to strengthen the sector, he said.\nMr. Shah flagged off 100 new police vehicles, visited an exhibition of cooperative products, and distributed appointment letters to youths selected for government jobs. He also virtually inaugurated 24 food grain storage warehouses and 64 millet outlets on the occasion.\nBesides the CM Mr. Sharma, Union Minister of Culture & Tourism Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Deputy CMs Prem Chand Bairwa and Diya Kumari, and former CM Vasundhara Raje were also present."

    "content": "Nearly two weeks after the Calcutta High Court’s order, following a hearing on the South Calcutta Law College rape case, asked the West Bengal government to ask all universities and colleges to lock up their students’ union rooms, the Department of Higher Education finally issued an order asking institutions to follow what the Court said.\nQuoting theJuly 3 High Court orderthat the “students’ union room in colleges and universities shall be put under lock and key and no student shall be permitted to enter or use the said students’ union or students’ room except with the written permission of the registrar or any person competent to issue such permission”, the State Government asked institutions to act according to it.\n“The purpose for the visit by the student to such a room identified for the students’ union should be disclosed in the letter. However, this shall not include the students’ recreational or common room. This order shall be restricted to the room/rooms identified and used as students’ union room,” the department said in its circular issued late on Wednesday (July 16, 2025).\n“Our college has tightened things already. The union room is locked. Extra female security personnel are now engaged to monitor different zones of the college campus. Entire campus is under CCTV surveillance. I meet girl students twice a week to know if they are comfortable within the campus. Programmes on self-defence for women are being organised regularly,” Jaydeep Sarangi, principal of Kolkata’s New Alipore College, toldThe Hinduin his reaction to the order. ‎\nAn associate professor at another West Bengal college, requesting anonymity, said, “While some colleges in the State immediately closed down the union rooms after the High Court issued the directive, most of the colleges paid no heed to what the Court said. The logic behind such negligence was that there was no clear order from the Directorate of Higher Education about its compliance.”\nThe teacher added: “This order from the directorate should come as a relief for students and faculty members in various colleges across the State who are constantly reeling under undue interference in academic and administrative matters by former students and outsiders who control the union room. This timely check may set things right.”\nIt is a common complaint among teachers and students in West Bengal colleges that young men no longer studying in a college often roam about on the campus, even beyond working hours, trying to intimidate current students.\n“I have been a regular witness to the unsettling behaviour of former students who are constantly ‘monitoring’ faculty performance, creating false narratives, often intimidating, and publicly humiliating female teachers and female students. A culture of threat prevails in institutions, something that is damaging the academic environment to a large extent,” complained an assistant professor with a government college."

    "content": "The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has issued comprehensive directions to all State Adoption Resource Agencies (SARAs) to strengthen and institutionalise structured counselling services throughout the adoption process — from pre-adoption, to during adoption, and post-adoption stages.\nThese directions have been issued via a communication dated July 7 under the powers conferred by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (as amended in 2021), and are aligned with the provisions laid down under the Adoption Regulations, 2022, an official statement said here on Thursday.\nCARA is a statutory body of the Ministry of Women and Child Development which acts as the nodal agency for the adoption of Indian children, both within the country and internationally.\nThis latest initiative aims to reinforce the psychosocial support framework for all key stakeholders — prospective adoptive parents (PAPs), adopted children, and biological parents who surrender their child for adoption.\nCARA has emphasised that counselling is a critical component of the adoption process and is necessary to ensure emotional preparedness, smooth transition, and long-term well-being of both the children and the families involved. The memorandum reiterates the mandatory nature of structured and need-based counselling services, as prescribed under various provisions of the Adoption Regulations, 2022.\nThe State adoption boards have been instructed to designate or empanel qualified counsellors at the district and State levels.\nThese professionals should ideally have a background in child psychology, mental health, or social work. It has been made mandatory to provide pre-adoption counselling to prospective adoptive parents during the Home Study Report (HSR) process, in accordance with Regulation 10(7). Additionally, older children must receive counselling support both before and during the adoption process, the statement said.\nIt said post-adoption counselling is to be provided in specific situations, such as when an adopted child initiates a root search to trace their origins, in cases of non-adjustment between the child and adoptive family, or in any situation indicating potential disruption or dissolution of the adoption.\nThe directions also include provisions for psychosocial intervention in any other circumstances as assessed by the Specialised Adoption Agencies (SAAs) or District Child Protection Units (DCPUs)."

    "content": "The Justice Michael D’Cunha Commission that probed the stampede at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium that killed 11 and left 71 injured on June 4, has held “not regulating the entry into the gates and making reckless announcements with regard to the entry into the stadium” as the “root cause for the stampede and the consequent death and injuries”.\n“This situation was created by the organisers themselves due to the lack of preparation and hasty decision, which tantamount to recklessness bordering or grass negligence, for which the organisers should be made accountable,” the report said.\n“A huge crowd had gathered at the venue in response to the post made by the RCB on its official handle by way of two posts at 7.01 a.m. and 8 a.m. Though the general public were invited for the proposed event in large numbers, the details as to the manner of entry to the stadium was not specified even after the crowd surged at the stadium, and the crowd was not directed to the respective gates,” the report said.\n“The absence of coordinated messaging and reliable updates prevented effective crowd management and contributed directly to the uncontrolled surge at various gates, most notably at Gate No.7, 2/2A, 18, 20 and other gates where 1 1 deaths and 71 injuries were recorded due to the chaotic crowding caused by communication failures,” it further said.\nThe report said that the security provided by the police was “inadequate and ineffective to meet the exigency”. Under deployment of security and police personnel at high-risk gates compounded the security lapses, the report further said, adding that even these men and officers were not visible at the venue during the crisis.\n“Despite clear signs of overcrowding and rising risk, the exit gates were not opened in time. It was a serious act of negligence on the part of security authorities and absence of emergency protocols. One of the key contributing factors to the stampede was the improper and unscientific installation of the barricades and the narrow constricted entry gates,” the report said.\nThe report further said that ambulances were deployed far off like on Old Airport Road and there was no casualty reception point or temporary medical centre, which meant that critical time was lost in providing life saving care to victims of stampede.\nThe report finds that “the design and structure of the stadium was unsuitable and unsafe for mass gathering” and “given these systematic limitations” the commission “strongly recommends that stadium authorities consider relocating events that are expected to attract large crowds to venues that are better suited for such large gatherings”.\nAny future venue should adhere to international standards, including built queuing and circulation zones separated from public roads, adequate entry / exit gates for mass entry and exit, integrated public transport access points and tourist hubs, emergency evacuation plans compliant with international safety norms and sufficient parking and drop off infrastructure.\n“Until such infrastructural changes are made, continuing to host high attendance events at the current location poses unacceptable risks to public safety, urban mobility and emergency preparedness,” the report says."

Coastal Restoration Mission, and several international instances, especially the Nordic countries.\nIt has also suggested that the government should plan a hi-tech city along the proposed ring road around Amaravati, covering Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, and other hi-tech industrial hubs / centres, and to consider emulating the Sri City model across the State to give a fillip to the electronics, semiconductor and drones sector.\nBesides, the task force has suggested the development of integrated IT parks and incubation centres, while offering sector-specific incentives, particularly for R&D, in Anantapur, Tirupati, and Visakhapatnam, framing of a dedicated AI policy, and setting up of an AI sandbox for nurturing entrepreneurs, facilitating the factors of production, and promoting skill development among the youth.\nAnother significant recommendation is to undertake a study to identify challenges, gaps and growth opportunities for building a strategic roadmap for the State to become a Clinical Trial hub, and to elevate the State’s positioning in India’s MedTech industry by nurturing a robust innovation ecosystem.\nTo capture the emerging opportunities in downstream industries in the petrochemical sector, like bioplastics, the task force has recommended to the government to announce a dedicated policy for chemicals and petrochemicals, and to fast-track ongoing projects in the Visakhapatnam-Kakinada Petroleum, Chemical & Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR).\nIt has been noted that the petrochemical industry is now concentrated in a few States such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, and the coastal regions such as Andhra Pradesh have significant prospects to capture some of the opportunities.\nVisualising opportunities in shipbuilding, submarine MRO, aerospace OEM, precision manufacturing and defence electronics, testing centres for ammunition and components (specifically in Kurnool), and propulsion systems and rocket technology development, the task force has recommended that the government should fast-track the development of already identified Aerospace & Defence Industrial Parks and plan more in the PPP mode with plug-and-play infra.\nIt has also suggested the setting up of defence testing infrastructure as a common facility under the private sector, establishing an air cargo complex as an integrated facility housing both domestic and international cargo terminals around the new international airports in Visakhapatnam and Amaravati / Vijayawada, and creating a thriving ecosystem for R&D with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Satish Dhawan Space Centre and other private players."

    "content": "Influential women icons Raziyya Sultan, who once ruled the Delhi Sultanate, and Nur Jehan from the Mughal era, have been omitted from the new Class 8 National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) social science textbook introduced from the current academic year (2025-26).\nWhile students earlier learnt about the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals in Class 7, the new Class 7 textbooks culminate before the 12th century timeline. This content has now been included in Part one of the new Class 8 textbook.\nIn the older textbook, two chapters – one on the Delhi Sultanate and another on the Mughals – were taught in the Class 7 bookOur Pasts - II.It had a section dedicated to the story of Raziyya Sultan, daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. A similar chapter in the new Class 8 textbook omits her mention. In the old textbook, Raziyya, who became the ruler (Sultan) in 1236 and continued her reign till 1240, had been described as more “able” and “qualified” than all her brothers. The book noted how Raziyya mentioned on her inscriptions and coins that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish, in contrast to queen Rudramadevi of the Kakatiya dynasty who changed her name on inscriptions and pretended to be a man.\nThe new Class 8 textbook that features the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals in Chapter 2 -Reshaping India’s Political Mapdoes not mention any women ruler or queen of the time. For instance, it also omits the mention of Emperor Jahangir’s wife Nur Jehan, who in the old textbook had been referred to as having “influence in Jahangir’s court”. The old textbook also stated that silver coins were “struck in the name of the Queen Begum Nur Jehan”, and seals were issued in her name. Messages inscribed on the seals granted her the status of an equal to Emperor Jahangir, the book said.\nIn the chapter on Mughals in the new textbook, references to Rani Durgavati, queen of Garha Kingdom, one of the Gond kingdoms in central India, have been freshly added. The new text mentions that she “led her troops and fought bravely”, against Mughal ruler Akbar’s attempts to attack her kingdom in 1564.\nIn chapter three of the new textbook,The Rise of the Marathas,a section titled “Mighty Maratha Women”, mentions Tarabai as a “fearless warrior queen”, who resisted Emperor Aurangzeb’s expansion efforts. She has been called “the architect of the northward Maratha expansion”. Ahilyabai Holkar has also been mentioned as being “instrumental in the Maratha expansion in North India”.\nMichel Danino, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group head for Social Science textbooks, toldThe Hinduthat a section on Begum Hazrat Mahal of Awadh had been included in Chapter 4 -The Colonial Era in India.She has been mentioned as a “heroine”, who joined “the rebels during the 1857 uprising.”\n“We would have liked to include more such influential women icons, however, at one point the question was that of space. We also have a mandate of reducing syllabus. We will see later if we can include some of those references in the upcoming chapters or textbooks,” Mr. Danino added.\nMention of Tipu Sultan, who was referred to as The “Tiger of Mysore” in the old Class 8 history textbookOur Pasts - III[Chapter two - From Trade to Territory (The Company Establishes Power)], has been omitted from the new textbook’s chapter -The Colonial Era in India. Tipu Sultan had been mentioned 16 times in the old textbook and was credited with stopping sandalwood, pepper and cardamom export, disallowing local merchants from trading with the British East India Company.\nHis predecessor Haidar Ali too has been omitted from the new textbook. Portions on the four Anglo-Mysore wars fought in 18th century between Tipu Sultan and the British have been removed.\nThe old textbook featured a section on “War with Marathas” which has been expanded upon in the new textbook in a separate newly added chapter -The Rise of the Marathas. It highlights three Anglo-Maratha Wars fought between 1775 and 1818.\n“Previously Marathas have been mentioned in old NCERT history textbooks in passing, however, they had an important role to play in resisting and eroding the Mughal rule, hence it was thought befitting to analyse the Maratha rule in detail, hence an entire chapter has been assigned to the Maratha empire,” Mr. Danino said.\nThe NCERT textbook says: “For three decades since 1771, the Marathas recaptured Delhi, and it remained in their control for after which the British captured the capital.”\nA map in the textbook shows that in 1759, the extent of Maratha empire ranged from Kolhapur in Maharashtra to Cuttack in Odisha, and Peshawar in the north. “Founded in 17th century by Shivaji, the Maratha Kingdom’s decades-long resistance to Mughal and experience gained from this, helped in its pan-Indian expansion in the 18th century.”\nThe chapter states that owing to Marathas’ increased disunity, and the superior organisational and technological abilities of the British, they succeeded in ending the Maratha power. “In effect, the British took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals or any other power,” the NCERT text states.\nThe chapter also highlights the “occasional indiscipline” and “abuse” during the Marathas’ 10-year campaign in Bengal (post-Shivaji’s death) that inflicted cruelty and devastation on common people.\n“It is important to understand that the new textbooks are not modelled on the old ones because the new books follow the new educational philosophy of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework 2023. Therefore, the textbooks are going to be significantly different, with a completely revamped syllabus,” Mr. Danino stated.\nHe further said,“Part two of the Class 8 history section of the Social Science textbook will focus on the Indian freedom movement between 1857 and 1947.”"

It is considered an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a Delhi-based think tank.

    "content": "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) West Bengal State Secretary, Md Salim, accused on Thursday (July 17, 2025) that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) Electoral Roll revision is a strategic method to remove all marginalised people from the voter lists and strip them of their democratic rights.\n“We have to accept that India is a multilingual country, the union government’s tactic of one nation, one election, one language cannot work here. This attack on Bengalis across the country is an attack on the diversity, democracy, and unity of our country,” Mr Salim said. He also added that tagging all Bengali-speaking people as Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshis is a way to “other” a certain class of people and attack them.\nHe alleged that Bharatiya Janta Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh supported organisations are putting various labels on Bengalis and pushing them out of BJP-ruled states, and sometimes outside India into Bangladesh, and in some cases, they are being tagged in the category of doubtful voters.\n“We have a lot of partition refugees, these displaced Bengalis were given a place to stay in Andaman, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh during the partition crisis. How can they abuse the same people for speaking Bengali and call them Bangladeshis?” Mr Salim said while addressing a press conference in Kolkata. He also said that at some point, it will affect all communities, and not just Bengalis. He accused that once the Matua community was given cards to prove their identity, now the same government is attacking them in various BJP-ruled States.\nMr Salim said that the measure to revise the electoral voter list through the SIR is a measure to remove the marginalised people from the voter lists and take away their voting rights.\n“Under SIR, everyone will have to prove their citizenship. Back in the day, in any democratic State, the government needed to prove a person’s citizenship; now the onus is solely on the people,” Mr Salim said while responding to a question byThe Hindu.He added that the magnitude at which the central government is planning to implement the SIR electoral roll revision will affect everyone. “If it burns my house today, soon it will burn all other houses,” Mr Salim concluded.\nWest Bengal and its politicians have been engaging in a political war of words over the past few weeks after several cases of Bengali-speaking migrant workers being targeted in States like Odisha, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Chhatisgarh came to light.\nOn Wednesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit the streets in Kolkata to protest against the attack on Bengali migrants in various BJP-ruled States. The Trinamool Congress chairperson warned of dire consequences if targeting of Bengali migrants did not stop. “The poor who go to work outside. They will be made to work and then sent to jail if they speak in Bengali. Why? What is your [BJP] right? Is West Bengal not in India? Why so much hatred against Bengalis,” Ms. Banerjee said.\nThe TMC leadership is raising the issue of attack on “Bengali identity” along with the attack on migrants. The issue of Bengali identity and pride had helped the party tide over the BJP in the 2021 Assembly polls.\nOn the day, the TMC leader held a march to protest against the attack on migrants, Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari met the State’s Chief Electoral Officer demanding a thorough revision of the voter list in West Bengal in the same way that it is being implemented in Bihar."

Citing inaction, locals staged a protest in front of the administration, which sought to take custody of the body for a postmortem examination.  The villagers claimed that despite numerous instances of man-animal conflict and sightings of tigers,the authorities failed to provide security to humans.\nIn Bithra Mandaria village, Trishna, 50, was mauled to death by a tiger. Her half-eaten body was recovered from a sugarcane field. Half an hour later, Nilesh, 20, was attacked by the tiger. The injured boy was saved after his friend fought off the tiger with a stick. The tiger injured another local from a neighbouring village who was working on his farmland. Both the injured are receiving treatment at a government hospital. Top district officials, including District Magistrate Gyanendra Singh, visited the affected areas and pacified the locals.\nDivisional Forest Officer Bharat Kumar said a trained team has been deployed at the spot following official approval for the tiger’s capture. The District officials directed forest officials to intensify surveillance and deploy expert teams to track the tigers. This is the seventh tiger attack in Pilibhit district since April 2025. On July 15, a farmer was mauled to death by a tigress barely metres away from his hut when he had gone to check his sugarcane crop in Phulhar village near the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR).\nThe areas near the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, located in Pilibhit district, frequently witness man-animal conflict. The northern edge of the reserve lies along the Indo-Nepal border, while the southern boundary is marked by the river Sharada and Khakra. A study done by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) shows that the Dudhwa-Pilibhit population has high conservation value as it represents the only tiger population with the ecological and behavioral adaptations of the tiger unique to the Tarai region."

    "content": "August 31, 2024. Large swathes of Vijayawada was under water. The previous day, the city had received over 180 mm of rainfall or 17% of its annual share, and the calm rivulet of Budameru had swelled and swallowed 14 divisions of the metropolis.\nKodada Sreedhar, a young railway contract employee from Laxmi Nagar in Payakapuram, was wading through filthy floodwater that had risen till his chest. Like many others in his colony, he was fully dependent on food and water packets being distributed by the government and relief workers, and he was in a hurry to get them. As he pushed through, his eyes caught something floating by. It took his weary mind a few seconds more to recognise what it was: a body. “It belonged to a young man,” says Sreedhar, horror punctuating this words.\nFor months since that day, Sreedhar used to have panic attacks in the dead of night. “The cries for help, and people jostling with one another to get food packets remains etched in my memory,” he says.\nThough a year has passed since that hellish experience, many are still picking up the pieces, and as another August is round the corner, fear pools on their faces whenever the skies darken.\nThe official toll due to floods in the State in 2024, including fatalities in the districts of NTR, Guntur and Palnadu, stood at 32 as of September 5 that year. But according to the residents, the actual number must have been higher as the government did not take into account those who died of infections and fever in the days following the flood.\nAccording to government records, 2,72,727 people were directly or indirectly affected by the calamity. Jones Manikonda, a social worker who runs ‘Little Hope Trust’ and who, along with a few volunteers, had helped hundreds during the floods, says they provided financial assistance to 25 families in the city who had lost a loved one to the disaster. The deaths were due to fevers, infections and other flood-related reasons.\nEighteen-year-old Sirisha* (name changed), a resident of Vambay Colony near Budameru, lost her mother to a skin infection. The 35-year-old woman, who was mentally ill and diabetic, had entered the floodwater to collect waste paper. She returned with an infection, which festered and killed her in two weeks. The death of her mother and devastation of the flood took a heavy toll on Sirisha’s mental health.\nJones Manikonda points out that fear and anxiety still linger in many and recounts multiple instances of people telling her how they were waking up in the middle of the night and unable to go back to sleep.\nNaga Lakshmi, another resident of the same colony, says she freezes momentarily every time it rains or power goes. “I shudder at the though of what would happen if floods struck the city again.” The 24-year-old was in her ninth month of pregnancy and was due for delivery when Budameru flooded her small one BHK apartment on the first floor of an apartment complex.\n“The doctor had told us that the delivery would be complicated, and we had saved up around ₹30,000 for the surgery,” says Lakshmi, whose husband works at a tile shop and earns ₹400-₹500 a day. Along with all that cash, the family also lost two gold chains, two pairs of earrings and two rings to the floods. A television, a double bed and a fridge were damaged beyond repair.\nHer husband, a heart patient, suffered a stroke in the aftermath of the floods due to stress and her elder son contracted typhoid twice and had to be taken to the hospital many times. Financially decimated, the family now lives on two meals a day.\nBalayya, an autorickshaw driver currently living in Chitti Nagar, says it will take a minimum of five years for them to piece their life together. “The well-off can replace their damaged goods; that’s not the case for us,” he says.\nIn the aftermath of the floods, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had announced a compensation of ₹25,000 to flood victims who have their homes on the ground floor and ₹10,000 to those who had houses on the first floor. While Lakshmi (first floor) got the compensation, Sirisha (ground floor) and two more women in the colony say they did not get any. Even Sreedhar, who incurred a loss of around ₹3 lakh during the floods, has not received the compensation.\nVijayawada, bounded by the Krishna to the south and the Budameru to northwest, has been ravaged by floods multiple times over the past century. According to the City Disaster Management Plan, prepared by Vijayawada Municipal Corporation Commissioner G. Ravi Babu and Project Support Associate P. Usha in 2011, there were 15 flood events between 1903 and 2009 in the Krishna river and an equal number of floods in the Budameru, which flows through the city for about 21 km, between 1962 and 2008. The report was a Union government and United Nations Development Programme project.\nWhile the Prakasam Barrage has a capacity of 11.90 lakh cusec, last year, the discharge rate at the barrage touched 11.43 lakh cusec, the highest ever. As for Budameru, the highest discharge rate till 2024 was recorded in 1964, at 28,470 cusec, as per the report. Last year’s discharge rate, however, was 40,000 cusec at the Velagaleru regulator.\nBudameru, originating near Mylavaram, circles Vijayawada before joining the Kolleru. From there, it goes to the sea through Upputeru. In between, it is joined by many streams. The rivulet remains dry most of the year.\nAsked why, despite a long history of floods in the city, the authorities are unable to curb the destruction, Srinivas (name changed), a retired official in the Irrigation Department, says floods are unforeseen natural calamities that can’t be prevented. “But, one can always try to mitigate the disaster.”\nThe rivulet is controlled near the Velagaleru regulator. Budameru Diversion Channel (BDC), the present carrying rate of which is 15,000 cusec, was dug in 1964 to divert floodwater to the Krishna river before it enters the city, the official says.\nWhen the regulator receives inflows beyond its capacity of 15,000 cusec, the gates are operated. “Last year, due to extremely heavy rainfall of 20 cm-30 cm in two days in catchments, the regulator received inflow at 40,000 cusec. Because the Krishna was also in spate, the BDC could not empty excess flood water into the Krishna as the water level in Krishna is higher than that of the BDC. Besides, there is no flood forecasting system at Velagaleru to prepare the city for floods,” he explains.\nWhile last year’s floods broke all previous records, in the past, too, there were occurrences where both the rivers overflowed. Between 1962 and 2009, it happened six times: 1964, 1983, 1989, 2005, 2008 and 2009.\n“The doctor had told us that the delivery would be complicated, and we had saved up around ₹30,000 for the surgery; all that money was lost in the floods.”Naga LakshmiFlood victim\nWhile what happened last year was rare, the official feels it could have been managed better had the encroachments along the rivulet in the city been removed.  “These encroachments have restricted or narrowed the rivulet, causing inundation to last for a longer period,” says the official. At a few places, it took nearly ten days for the water to recede.\nAnother retired Irrigation official, Satnanarayana (name changed), argues that the government did its best during the floods.\nThe 2011 report points a finger at politicians for making “false promises” to those who constructed houses illegally along Budameru. They allegedly tell people that they would help them get the houses regularised. This results in more occupations near the floodplain.\nIt is to address this issue that Chandrababu Naidu announced ‘Operation Budameru’. Along with removing encroachments, plans were drawn up to desilt and widen the BDC.\nR. Mohan Rao, Superintendent Engineer of the Irrigation Circle, Vijayawada, says that as part of Operation Budameru, the department has sent a Detailed Project Report to the State government.\n“It has three important components: a proposal for a new Budameru channel from Velagaleru regulator to Enikepadu Under Tunnel. The new channel, which will bypass the city, will need land acquisition, and ₹3,289 crore has been estimated for this. From Enikepadu Under Tunnel to Kolleru and onwards to the sea through Upputeru, the existing Budameru drain will be strengthened and widened. The estimated cost for the two tasks is ₹1,500 crore. Desilting, too, will be done,” says the official.\n“Because the Krishna was also in spate, the BDC could not empty excess flood water into the Krishna as the water level in the Krishna is higher than that of the BDC. Besides, there is no flood forecasting system at Velagaleru to prepare the city for floods”SrinivasRetired Irrigation Department official\nAsked what has been done since the floods last year, the official says a number of breaches along the BDC were fixed. But, from Mylavaram to the regulator, where 72 breaches had been reported, only temporary work has been carried out. He adds that tenders have been called and that full-scale work would begin soon.\nMoreover, the official says that 3,100 encroachments, mostly residential complexes, have been identified in the city limits. Removing one encroachment is estimated to cost an upwards of ₹20 lakh, including resettlement. Plans are being drawn to enhance the carrying capacity of Enikepadu Under Tunnel, where the proposed Budameru channel will meet the existing one.\n“Currently, discussions are under way. First, we have been asked to focus on widening and strengthening of the Budameru drain, without disturbing encroachments,” he says, adding that due to the huge amount of fund involved, the government is looking at options to fund the project.\nMeanwhile, another Irrigation official, who sought anonymity, says there is a proposal to enhance the carrying rate of BDC from the present 15,000 cusec to 37,550 cusec. The same proposal, however, was mooted in 2011, too, but not much was done as part of it.\nThe official was quick to add that the work began in 2021, but stalled owing to fund crunch before even 25% of the work could be completed. “Currently, ₹800 crore is needed for the BDC widening work,” he says, adding that the State government is yet to sanction funds.\nIn the 2011 report, too, widening of the BDC is listed as a solution to the floods, but due to reasons unknown, nothing much has been done so far.\nSatyanarayana feels widening will not yield much. “It is adequate as it is. Besides, widening it will not help much if the Krishna is also in spate, in which case there will be a backflow in the BDC,” he says, adding that desilting, too, is not required.\nAs discussions happen and file move in the echelons of power, people like Sreedhar, Sirisha and Lakshmi keep their fingers crossed. The hundreds they represent carry the raw scars from last year’s devastation and, as a dark clouds march over Vijayawada, seek assurances that their city can weather the next storm."

    "content": "As the clouds play hide-and-seek and the sun beats down in mid-July, in what has been a dry southwest monsoon for Bengaluru thus far, waters of the Arkavati river, unsettlingly black, flows its course on the outskirts of the city.\nJayaram, 60, a resident of Jogerahalli, close to the Thippagondanahalli (T.G. Halli) reservoir, is walking around in the quaint village as devotional songs play out of a speaker from a nearby temple. Two class 5 students of a government school hang around him as he tellsThe Hindu, “Until a few years ago, we used to wash clothes in the river. They started letting polluted water in from everywhere. What flows now is acid water. We cannot even step into it. There is an odour and froth. Some are brave enough to use it for agriculture.”\nHe recalled that, when he was around 30 years old, he would drink water from the river and wash clothes in it. “When it rains, we see some clean water briefly, and then the black water comes again. The water is of no use to anyone, not even to animals,” he says.\nBallyamma, 60, at the nearby Varthur Narasimhapura, was watching over her grazing goats close to a pumping station. “I came here after getting married 40 years ago, and I remember we used to drink this water and cook with it. It has been at least 15 years since we stopped using it. It smells,” she says, adding that they use borewell water for their daily needs.\nOnce the primary source of drinking water for Bengaluru — from 1936 to 2000, according to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) — the Arkavati is today what one research called “a ghost river”, a shadow of its former glorious self.\nIn June 2025, the Karnataka government announced a high-level committee of experts to spearhead the rejuvenation of the Arkavati through a public-private partnership model.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                K. MURALI KUMAR\nOver two-and-a-half decades later, in June 2025, the Karnataka government announced a high-level committee of experts to spearhead the rejuvenation of the Arkavati through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The BWSSB, while announcing the plan, said, “Stretching 53 km from Nandi Hills to T.G. Halli, and covering a basin area of 1,400 sq. km, the Arkavati holds immense potential to be reborn as a sustainable lifeline.”\nBWSSB Chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, while announcing the plan, said water from the Yettinahole project (which envisages the diversion of west-flowing river water to meet the drinking water needs of seven parched districts in the south Karnataka region) was intended to mix with the Arkavati waters at T.G. Halli, but rapid industrial growth, wastewater discharge, and environmental degradation rendered the reservoir’s water unfit for consumption. While admitting that only 15% of the Arkavati’s river basin falls under the BWSSB’s jurisdiction, he also said that several government agencies, NGOs, and civic bodies were coming together to shape a comprehensive action plan.\nThe BWSSB also announced that Infrastructure Development Corporation (Karnataka) Ltd. has already begun an integrated study covering areas such as Hesaraghatta, Madanayakanahalli, and parts of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), laying the groundwork for rejuvenation.\nAccording to a BWSSB document on the ‘Rejuvenation of Arkavathy River up to TG Halli’, from the origin of the river at Nandi Hills, till Doddaballapur town, the stream is less polluted, barring drain water entry and dumping of solid waste.\n“Municipal sewage from Doddaballapur town enters into the Nagara Kere (lake) and polluted industrial wastewater enters from Bashettyhalli Industrial Area at Veerapur into the river,” says the document, adding that once the river crosses Doddaballapur town and enters Bengaluru Rural, the river is in “a highly stressed state due to pollution from rapid urbanisation and industrialisation”.\nThe document also acknowledges that as the river traverses, it accumulates various pollutants, including untreated sewage and industrial waste, leading to poor water quality in T.G. Halli, and that the water is not useful for drinking or any other domestic purposes.\nThe BWSSB has planned to take up the rejuvenation of the Arkavati from Nandi hills to T.G. Halli (54 km) “to make the river pollution-free”.\nThe document lists views and recommendations from multiple stakeholders of the river, one of which is the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), as the Dr. Shivaram Karanth Layout is in the Arkavati catchment area. “It is necessary to know the disposal scheme of the wastewater generated from the layouts developed by the BDA in the Bengaluru region,” it says.\nBut is it going to be possible? Experts who have conducted studies on the river say it is not going to be easy. Sharachchandra Lele, Distinguished Fellow in Environmental Policy and Governance, Centre for Environment and Development, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, says “rejuvenation” is a tricky concept.\nAccording to a BWSSB document, once the river crosses Doddaballapur town and enters Bengaluru Rural, Arkavati river is in ‘a highly stressed state due to pollution from rapid urbanisation and industrialisation’.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                K. MURALI KUMAR\n“If it means the natural flow should come back, that will require major changes in groundwater use in the upstream, which looks very difficult. If it means making the river flow ‘anyhow’, then the idea of putting Yettinahole water into T.G. Halli will make it look like the Arkavati has been ‘rejuvenated’, but will it really solve any problem? We must also ask, ‘rejuvenation for whom?’ Do we want the Arkavati to be a ‘boating place’ or a ‘scenic riverside’ for urban folks, or a source of water and cultural value for agricultural households?” he asks.\nIn a study published in January 2013, titled ‘Water management in Arkavathy basin: A situation analysis’, of which Lele was one of the authors, it was stated that the decline of the Arkavati’s flow into T.G. Halli reservoir was directly caused by the expansion of eucalyptus cultivation and increased groundwater pumping in the T.G. Halli catchment area.\n“It has been aggravated by the construction of an excessive number of check dams and other structures on the various streams that feed the Arkavati, which resulted in further reductions in surface flows, but did not augment baseflows as the groundwater withdrawal remained unregulated,” explains Lele. The changes in cropping, such as the growth of eucalyptus and shift to groundwater-irrigated horticulture and vegetable farming, are the result of government incentives, as well as market pressures (rising demand from Bengaluru), and also the result of changing labour availability as labour migrated to Bengaluru, he says.\n“While many of the changes are expected in an area close to a city, lack of a governance mechanism around groundwater and, in fact, around integrated management of water resources as a whole is the key missing policy piece. The benefits of groundwater over-exploitation have gone disproportionately to the rich farmers, as poorer farmers could not afford to dig borewells, or abandoned them after they failed, as groundwater levels dropped,” he says, adding that the State agency in charge of T.G. Halli reservoir (the BWSSB) lost interest in the inflow decline problem, because it shifted to the Cauvery as the only source that they think will serve all of Bengaluru’s water needs.\nA more recent report, ‘Uncovering the hidden pollution in the Arkavathi - Emerging contaminants impacting Bengaluru & beyond,’summarises the results of pollution testing along the river conducted by Paani.Earth, in collaboration with the International Centre for Clean Water, IIT Madras, in February and March 2024. Paani tested samples for 65 unique water and 20 unique sediment pollution parameters and compared the testing results to national and international standards and guidelines for freshwater and sediment pollution.\nThe report states that every single test site exhibited pollution values above national and international standards and guidelines. “Even remote areas with no visible pollution had high levels of persistent pollutants, highlighting the river’s vulnerability to long-range contamination. Across test sites, Paani observed notable spikes in pollution levels, frequently downstream of industrial areas or other zones with known pollution discharges. Additionally, the results demonstrated that high levels of pollutants from Urban Bengaluru enter the Arkavati via the Vrishabhavati and degrade water quality. Many of the river sites had high phosphorus levels, causing eutrophication,” states the report.\n“Currently, our rivers are graded A to E based on just a handful of parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, coliform bacteria, and a few others to decide if the water is ‘fit’ for drinking, bathing, irrigation, or industrial use. But these grades don’t take into account many persistent and harmful chemicals that remain in the water and soil. As a result, water can still be carrying dangerous contaminants like hexavalent chromium and yet be reported as ‘safe for irrigation’ just because it meets those limited criteria,” says Madhuri Mandava, who, along with Khushbu K. Birawat, both from Paani, accompaniedThe Hinduon the site visit to the Arkavati.\nAccording to a study, the decline of the Arkavati’s flow into T.G. Halli reservoir is directly caused by the expansion of eucalyptus cultivation and increased groundwater pumping in the catchment area.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                K. MURALI KUMAR\nShe adds that the instruments used are not sensitive enough to pick up dangerous chemicals in lower concentrations, which means harmful contamination can go completely unnoticed and unreported, while the same water continues to irrigate the food we eat.\nLele says it is unlikely that the river will ever flow again “as it did in the past”, and that this “past flowing river” itself is a myth. “We must remember that even 200 years ago, there were probably 400 irrigation tanks blocking streams in the T.G. Halli catchment and that water was used to cultivate sugarcane/paddy. It is best to aim for sustainable and equitable water use in the T.G. Halli catchment and avert water pollution in the reservoir, because the Kumudavati is still contributing inflow. Bengalureans really do not stand to benefit from its rejuvenation, unless the idea is for T.G. Halli dam to start supplying water again, which seems very unlikely,” he says.\nBirawat is more optimistic. “The first step to healing our rivers is to see what is really hurting them and identify the sources. The Central Pollution Control Board’s 2017 guidelines for water quality monitoring laid out a robust framework to help understand pollution sources, trends, and the effectiveness of control measures. But on the ground, implementation by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board falls short of this intent. Monitoring has been reduced to a simplistic grading exercise, with little evidence of meaningful classification of stations or comprehensive testing. As a result, the programme fails to guide corrective action or improve water quality, and risks, leaving the most critical pollution sources unaddressed,” she says.\nShe also says no matter how much we clean the Arkavati, it will not make a real difference if the Vrishabhavati keeps pouring pollution into it.\nA river, she points out, is just not water; it is a living ecosystem. “A river is so much more than just a line of water between two banks. It reflects everything around it — the forests, the lakes, the built-up areas, the storm-water drains, the floodplains, the fields, the hills, and the aquifers underground. It does feel too little and too late, when you see the pathetic state of the river, but better late than never. If we truly wish to rejuvenate the Arkavati, we must also protect its catchment. It feels deeply counterintuitive when, on one hand, committees are set up to revive the river, yet on the other, the government proposes to dilute its buffer zones and weaken the T.G. Halli preservation notification,” she adds.\n(Edited by Giridhar Narayan)"

    "content": "It was barely a few minutes into the 8.45 a.m. show ofThammuduon July 4 when the routine calm of Prasads’ multiplex in Hyderabad was broken. A staff member called out a viewer spotted filming a scene from the Telugu action drama, headlined by Nithiin and produced by Dil Raju’s Sri Venkateswara Creations. The man, as it turned out, was just a zealous fan hoping to grab a quick snapshot for social media. But the theatre management wasn’t willing to take chances.\nIn normal times, this might have been brushed off with a warning. But the atmosphere around film piracy has shifted — and for good reason. The increased scrutiny follows the arrest of Jana Kiran Kumar, a 29-year-old air-conditioner technician from Vanasthalipuram, Hyderabad, at the beginning of this month. He is accused of illegally recording and leaking nearly 40 Telugu films. His operations, police said, were closely tied to major piracy platforms.\nThe arrest is likely just the beginning, as law enforcement agencies tighten the noose around piracy syndicates that are bleeding the industry dry.\nRajkumar Akella, chairperson of the anti-piracy cell of the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, says the Telugu film industry alone lost an estimated ₹3,700 crore to piracy in 2024.\nPiracy is a silent killer that the Telugu film industry is grappling with, one that continues to operate in the shadows, chipping away at revenues with alarming consistency. This summer, the director of a star-led Telugu film, which was dubbed and released in multiple languages, confided to this journalist that both he and the lead actor chose to stay quiet about the piracy issue. Their fear? Drawing attention to it might inadvertently lead more people to these illegal sites.\n“A team is working round the clock to take down pirated links and film clippings from all digital platforms. If we talk about it, even those who are unaware of these websites might get curious,” the director had said.\nThat fear is not unfounded. Back in February, soon after Chandoo Mondeti’sThandelstarring Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi hit theatres, pirated versions of the film began doing the rounds online. The film’s producers Bunny Vasu and Allu Aravind highlighted the issue during a media interaction. But soon after, the film’s team noticed a spike in visits to piracy platforms.  “Our intention was to condemn the practice, but it had an unexpected fallout,” says producer Srinivas aka SKN, a longtime associate of Aravind’s Geetha Arts.\nSai Pallavi and Naga Chaitanya in ‘Thandel’.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\nActor-producer Vishnu Manchu, too, recently revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 30,000 pirated links of his filmKannappahad to be taken down.\nIt is no surprise, then that many filmmakers continue to tread carefully, deliberately avoiding mentioning piracy websites in public. These platforms have come to be treated like the Voldemort of the film world: those that shall not be named.\nHowever, they now want to go a step further, by raising awareness that piracy isn’t limited to just recording or sharing film content. Even watching pirated movies is a punishable offence under the law.\nTo that end, several representatives of the Telugu film industry have been working closely with both State and Central government authorities to devise a comprehensive plan to combat piracy.\nThe booming piracy market is proving to be a major threat to Telugu cinema. Posters of ‘Kuberaa’ and ‘Kannappa’ in the background.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Ramakrishna G.\nA prominent producer, who is part of these efforts, says on condition of anonymity: “Private tech teams hired by production houses can only do so much. They are focused on taking down pirated links that have already been uploaded. And new ones will surface. The problem has to be tackled at its root — nab those who illegally record films for piracy websites, track the servers that host these websites and hold them responsible. Nothing will change unless the culprits are arrested, named and shamed. This is possible only with help of the government and the cyber crime wing.”\nThe producer admits that, in the larger scheme of governance, film piracy might appear like a trivial concern — especially when the government deals with far more pressing issues. But the magnitude of the problem tells a different story. Piracy doesn’t just drain revenue from the film industry, it also robs the government of substantial tax income.\nRajkumar explains, “In recent years, the footfall in cinema halls has fallen by 50% and the major reason is piracy.” He points out that the Telugu film industry was the first in India to set up a dedicated anti-piracy cell. “We did extensive spadework and gathered data on piracy links and identified the hosting servers of websites, and submitted them to the State and Central government authorities so that the police can swiftly act on complaints.”\nWhile social media platforms like YouTube, X, Facebook and Instagram usually comply with takedown requests and remove pirated clips or links, dedicated piracy websites are a tougher nut to crack. Many of them lack any redressal mechanism, and those that do often ignore complaints. It is not as simple as tracking down an IP address, he says, adding, “Rogue websites such as movierulz, ibomma and several others operate anonymously using offshore hosting servers such as Cloudflare. These servers feign ignorance of the content being distributed on their problems. Despite repeated complaints, they do not respond.”\nTelegram, adds Rajkumar, has also proved to be a thorn in the flesh, as pirated links continue to be shared widely on the messaging platform, making enforcement even harder.\nPiracy has typically been found to take place at two stages. The first is during a film’s theatrical release, when people hired by piracy websites illegally record footage inside cinema halls. These recordings are then passed on to website operators, who upload the content online within hours. The second phase begins when a film releases on OTT platforms. Pirates use sophisticated software tools to bypass encryption and extract high-definition footage, which is then uploaded to their own websites. This dual threat impacts both box office collections and digital streaming revenues.\nIn the case of Jana Kiran Kumar, cyber crime authorities disclosed in a press statement that his entry into the piracy network began with a meme referring to the piracy group ‘1TamilMV’. Intrigued, Kumar contacted the group via a Proton Mail address, eventually shifting the conversation to Telegram. There, he was assigned the job of recording Telugu film releases in exchange for payments ranging from USD 300 to 400, all of it routed through cryptocurrency.\nTo carry out his assignments, Kumar booked tickets online, smuggled a mobile phone into the theatre by hiding it in his shirt pocket and discreetly recorded the films. The raw footage was then transferred to the piracy group through Telegram. He received payments in Bitcoin, which were later converted into rupees via Indian crypto platforms such as ZebPay and CoinDCX.\nAmong the films he is accused of pirating areSingle,Pellikani Prasad,14 Days Love,Thandel,Game On,KismatandRajadhani Files.\nKumar’s arrest was the result of a formal complaint filed on June 5 by Yarra Manindra Babu from the anti-piracy cell of the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, in connection with HD pirated versions ofSingle, a Geetha Arts production starring Sree Vishnu and Vennela Kishore.\nSree Vishnu and Ketika Sharma in ‘Single’.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\nThe film, which released on May 9, had its pirated versions circulating across multiple platforms within hours of its theatrical debut. According to police, forensic watermark analysis helped trace the source of the leak to a specific cinema hall. Based on this evidence, an FIR was registered, invoking multiple sections of the Information Technology Act, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Copyright Act and Cinematograph Act.\nIn the analog era, piracy existed in the form of video cassettes and CD-ROMs, typically sold a few days after a film’s release, in select pockets of urban markets. “Back then, several films enjoyed a 50-day or a 100-day theatrical run and the pirated copies were mostly of inferior quality. Digital technology has made it possible for pirates to upload HD-quality prints within a few hours of a film’s release, and these are shared widely. We have also seen important sequences of a film being streamed as clippings on Instagram Live. It is tough to keep tabs,” SKN points out.\nThe impact of piracy in the digital age has been especially damaging for an industry already reeling from falling footfall in theatres. Multiple factors are behind this decline — the shrinking window between theatrical and OTT releases, high ticket prices and the escalating cost of food and beverages in cinema halls. Piracy has only worsened the situation.\nToday, only those films that generate enough buzz prior to release manage to draw crowds during the opening weekend. If the word-of-mouth is strong, the momentum carries through for the next couple of weeks.\nBut for films that receive mixed reviews or poor word-of-mouth, piracy delivers a lethal blow. Industry observers note that such films are particularly vulnerable — audiences on the fence often skip a theatre visit, opting instead to wait for the OTT release or watch pirated versions online. Even in the case of successful films, the availability of pirated links affects repeat viewership.\nSKN recalls the release of his 2018 filmTaxiwaala, starring Vijay Deverakonda, which faced a major piracy scare due to a data storage leak. “Luckily, social media was not as pervasive then. The movie managed to do well in theatres. But not every film is that lucky.”\nTime is of essence to crack down on piracy so that a new film is not affected, says a producer: “FIRs have to be filed at the earliest and the police have to help arrest the culprits swiftly.”\nIndustry representatives also point out that several users of piracy apps and websites are unaware that they are watching illegal content. A producer adds, “Some of these websites have even begun showing advertisements, thereby legitimising the platform’s revenue earning mechanism. There is a need to step up awareness.”\nIndustry insiders reveal that for two recently released Telugu films, both backed by prominent production houses, the Hyderabad district court issued restraining orders against more than 110 websites known for circulating pirated content. The court directed those sites not to host, share or stream the films without authorisation. Copies of the court orders are withThe Hindu.\nAkella calls the court’s intervention a milestone in the industry’s long-standing battle against piracy. In one of the two cases, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting also stepped in, issuing a notification warning all websites against illegally publishing content and stating that stringent legal action would follow in case of non-compliance.\nBut the fight is far from over. Industry observers say further legal measures are being explored. Despite the court’s orders, piracy websites may adopt evasive tactics by masking their identities, redirecting users to alternate links or renaming their website extensions. Even so, in an industry where every Friday counts, the hope is that with each crackdown, the screen gets a little safer and the shadows where piracy thrives grow a little smaller."

    "content": "The stone edifice of Gangaikonda Cholisvaram, the Shiva temple more famously known as the Brihadisvara Temple, dominates the skyline of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram, a nondescript village in Udayarpalayam taluk of Ariyalur district. It is hard to believe that the place was a throbbing capital of the Imperial Cholas for about 250 years. The city, its temple, and its massive lake called Chola Gangam remain the embodiment of the signal achievements of Rajendra Chola I (regnal years 1012-1044 CE).\nRajendra Chola I is famed for his exploits, but his military expedition to the Gangetic plains about a thousand years ago remains one of the most celebrated in the history of the Chola dynasty. The Tiruvalangadu, Esalam, and Karanthai Copper Plates, several inscriptions, and literary works celebrate his victory and the construction of the Brihadisvara Temple, listed as one of the three great living Chola temples by UNESCO. Rajendra himself celebrated the victory by assuming the title ‘Gangaikonda Cholan’. He also built Gangaikonda Cholapuram, along with the Gangaikonda Cholisvaram — the jewel in his crown that rivals the Rajarajeswaram (also known as Brihadisvara Temple) built by his father in Thanjavur — and the Chola Gangam, excavated as a jalasthambam, a liquid pillar of victory.\nDuring the expedition to the Gangetic plains, Rajendra Chola I defeated several kings and chieftains, including the Kalinga ruler and the Pala ruler Mahipala of Bengal. According to the Tiruvalangadu Copper Plates, the vanquished kings were made to carry the Ganga water on their heads to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The water was poured into the Chola Gangam, now known as Ponneri. Rajendra Chola I also brought several beautiful Chalukya and Kalinga sculptures as war trophies.\nBut why did Rajendra Chola I shift his capital from Thanjavur? Many historians believe that one of the reasons could be that he wanted a bigger well-planned city to accommodate his huge army and serve his mercantile interests better. R. Nagasamy, the first Director of the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology, however, holds an interesting view. Rajendra Chola I, he says, probably had a “sentimental attachment” to the place which inspired him to attain phenomenal success, though it was unheard of even as a village when he came to the throne.\n“Tanjavur had been the Chola capital ever since it had been captured from the Muttaraiya chieftains by Vijayalaya... Tanjavur served the interests of the Cholas well... Yet, within a few years of the erection of the great temple [Rajarajeswaram] and within a few years of his [Raja Raja I] passing, his son, Rajendra, shifted his capital to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Was this because Gangaikonda Cholapuram served strategic purpose better than Tanjavur (but Tanjavur had better claims with its fortifications and natural river barriers)! No answer is possible except for a suggestion that it was probably here that Rajendra resolved to despatch a military expedition to the Gangetic plain,” says Nagasamy in his book,Gangaikondacholapuram, published by the department in 1970.\nGangaikonda Cholapuram remained the capital from 1025 CE till the fall of the Chola dynasty till 1279 CE. “As the capital of the Cholas from about 1025 AD for the about 250 years, the city controlled the affairs of entire south India, from the Tungabhadra in the north to Ceylon in the south,” says Nagasamy. It was the second largest and important city in the 11th-12th Centuries and the centre of political, commercial and cultural activities, like Madurai in Pandyanadu and Karur in Cheranadu, says Natana Kasinathan, another former Director of the Department of Archaeology. Yet, there is no inscription of Rajendra Chola I in the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple, a spectacular gallery of Chola art and architecture. It is from an inscription of his son Vira Rajendra that it is known that his father had built the temple. Details about the palace and other parts of the city are found in the epigraphs of Rajendra’s successors, says Kasinathan in his book,The Metropolis of Medieval Cholas. The inscription of Vira Rajendra, the third son of Rajendra, refers to the palace at Gangaikonda Cholapuram as Chola-Keralan Thirumaaligai, evidently named after one of the titles of Rajendra I.\nGangaikonda Cholapuram had been a bustling city with a fort, palaces, and well-planned streets. “In an inscription dated in the 49th year of Kulottunga (1119 AD,) a reference is made to Gangaikondachola maaligai at this place. It is likely that there were more than one royal building, each having its own name. Besides, the names of the palace and fort walls, the names of a few roads and streets are preserved in the epigraphs,” says Kasinathan.\nThe city is celebrated in Tamil literature too. An elaborate description of the citadel comes fromMuvar Ulaof Ottakuttar.Rajaraja Cholan Ulagives an account of almost all the important places of the city. The city is referred to as Gangapuri inKalingattuparani, composed by Jayankondar.\nThough there have been attempts to excavate and showcase the past glory of the city in the recent times, the fortunes of Gangaikonda Cholapuram seems to have come a full circle. “This capital of the most powerful empire in Asia at one time is now desolate, only the temple survives. To those who know of the brilliant history of the Chola empire, it is a tragedy,” writes Nagasamy. As he explains, the Pandyas, who put an end to the Chola empire in the 13th Century, avenging their defeats, “should have razed the city to the ground”. One thousand years have passed since the sacred Ganga water was brought to this city, and the millennium deserves to be commemorated as a fitting tribute to the emperor who founded the city, says R. Komagan, chairman, Gangaikonda Cholapuram Development Council Trust."

    "content": "Rajendra Chola I, the illustrious son of Raja Raja Chola I, expanded the frontiers of the Chola empire beyond the Indian subcontinent. Not only military conquests across South and Southeast Asia but also generous land grants and temple patronage marked his reign (1012-1044 CE). Among the most valuable records from Rajendra Chola’s time are four sets of copper plate inscriptions discovered at different locations across Tamil Nadu. These inscriptions shed light on Chola lineage, temple endowments, and military expeditions. The books,Sozhar Ceppedugalby Ve. Mahadevan and Ka. Sankaranarayanan (Tamil University, Thanjavur) andSozhar Kaala Ceppedugalby former IAS officer M. Rajendran (Akani Publishers), provide insights into copper plate inscriptions of various Chola kings, especially Rajendra Chola.\nThe Tiruvalangadu Copper Plates were first mentioned in the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for 1903-04. A detailed account appeared in the Madras Epigraphical Report of 1916. The plates were later published in Volume III ofSouth Indian Inscriptionsby epigraphist Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri. This set comprised 31 copper plates, with the first 10 inscribed in Sanskrit and the remaining 21 in Tamil. The inscription was divided into three parts: the Sanskrit section, the first Tamil section, and the second Tamil section. According to epigraphist V. Venkayya, the Tamil parts were considered earlier, with the Sanskrit section possibly added later. The second Tamil section referred to the sixth regnal year of Rajendra Chola I, placing it around 1018 CE.\nThe plates were linked together by a circular copper seal with royal emblems, including two fly-whisks on either side of a royal parasol, a tiger (the Chola emblem), two fishes (the Pandya emblem), a bow (the Chera emblem), a boar (the Chalukya emblem), a Swastik, and two lamps. Weighing 93.05 kilograms, these plates recorded the royal order of Rajendra Chola gifting Palaiyanur village to the Tiruvalangadu Shiva temple (in Tiruvallur district).\nThe Sanskrit section, with 271 lines, traced the Chola genealogy in a mythological lineage starting from the Sun. The Tamil section contained 524 lines, of which 145 lines described the royal order, 281 lines described the boundaries of the land grants, and 98 lines outlined the tax exemptions and other privileges.\nThe Karanthai Copper Plates were discovered in a field at Puthur village near Ammapettai in Papanasam taluk of Thanjavur district. Initially referred to as the Puthur Copper Plates, they were renamed after being preserved by the Karanthai Tamil Sangam at Karunthattankudi, near Thanjavur, in the late 1940s. They had reportedly been discovered six decades earlier on land belonging to Sevu Pandiyan. The Karanthai Tamil Sangam acquired the plates with assistance from a local development officer.\nThe set comprised 57 copper plates, weighing 111.73 kilograms, linked by two large copper rings, one of which was broken. The remaining ring bore the royal seal featuring the emblems of the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Cheras, and the Chalukyas, along with lamps, the royal parasol, and fly-whisks. Scholars identified three distinct sections, likely composed at different stages. The first section, written in Sanskrit and numbered continuously, appeared to have been compiled later. The second section, consisting of 22 plates inscribed in Tamil with 1,042 lines, detailed a major land donation. The third section, also in Tamil, comprised 32 plates and 1,456 lines, recording information about temples and listing land grants to 1,080 Brahmins. Several of the 54 Tamil plates bore the word ‘Thiribu’, referencing the gifted village — Thiribhuvana Mahadevi Chaturvedimangalam — named in honour of Rajendra Chola’s mother. The plates were issued in 1020 CE (his eighth regnal year).\nThe Tirukkalar Copper Plates were discovered at the Parijathavaneswarar Temple at Tirukkalar, a village nearly 20 kilometres southeast of Mannargudi, in Tiruvarur district. The temple yielded a set of five copper plates inscribed in Tamil and 23 stone inscriptions, all from the Chola period. The five plates, weighing 6.59 kilograms, were linked by a copper ring. The earliest among them was dated to around 1030 CE (the 18th regnal year of Rajendra Chola).\nThese plates detailed a land grant made to the Mahadevar Temple at Tirukkalar, which was part of the ‘Purangkaranbai Nadu’ in the ‘Arulmozhi Deva Valanadu’. Of the 30 lines inscribed on the plate, 28 narrated the king’s genealogy and achievements, while the final two lines detailed the land donation.\nThe Esalam Copper Plates were discovered at Esalam near Tindivanam on July 11, 1987, during the renovation of a Shiva temple. The finds included 15 copper plates, several bronze icons, and ritual objects. Esalam was the first site where all three types of historical artefacts were unearthed together. A similar triad was later found at Tiruindalur (in Mayiladuthurai district) in 2010.\nR. Nagasamy, then Director of the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology, studied the plates and confirmed that they belonged to the reign of Rajendra Chola. They were dated to 1036 CE (his 24th regnal year). Among the bronze icons was a statue of Sarva Siva Pandithar, believed to be Rajendra Chola’s guru.\nThese plates, engraved on both sides, were bound by a copper ring with a seal bearing the emblems of the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Cheras, and the Chalukyas, along with lamps, the royal parasol, and fly-whisks. The plates contained 424 lines: 80 in Sanskrit and 344 in Tamil. The inscriptions opened with Rajendra Chola’s genealogy in Sanskrit. The Tamil portion detailed his land grants to the temple built by Sarva Siva Pandithar and listed the regions conquered during his reign. His ‘meikeerthi’ (royal eulogy) said the famous Vidyadhara Torana was brought from Kadaram (Kedah in Malaysia) and was depicted on the seal of this set of copper plates."

    "content": "A few kilometres away from the Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram lies a tank stretching over 17 km. Chola Gangam, locally known as Ponneri, was dug by Rajendra Chola to celebrate his northern campaign. Historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, author ofThe Cholas, citing the Tiruvalangadu Copper Plates, notes that “at the end of the expedition, Rajendra erected a ‘liquid pillar of victory’ (ganga-jalamayam jayastambham) in his capital with the waters of the Ganga in the form of the tank Cholaganga.”\nBut the 1,000-year-old lake is in ruins. Once spread over 16 miles, the tank has shrunk to 17 km. It remains dry for most of the year as the canals that brought water from the Kollidam have long been abandoned. Yet, traces of these canals remain. Locals believe that the proposed visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27 and the government’s plan to release a commemorative coin could shed much-needed light on the lake. “The lake depends on surface water collected during the rains. It is a pity that the tank, which once supplied water to Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the 60-acre palace, is in such a pathetic state,” says R. Komagan, chairman of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram Development Council Trust, who has been fighting for years to restore the lake.\nThe Trichinopoly Gazetteer, authored by F.R. Hemingway, records that the tank once irrigated 1,564 acres of land, its primary purpose being to supply drinking water to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Sastri also reproduces a report on the tank that appeared in a local publication in 1855: “There is an embankment 16 miles long, running north and south, provided with several substantial sluices and of great strength, which in former times must have formed one of the largest reservoirs in India.” According to the same report, when the palace was still in existence, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was a wealthy and flourishing capital, and the great tank spread fertility over miles and miles of what is now trackless forest. “It has been projected to restore that magnificent work, but the scheme has remained in abeyance for want of engineer officers,” the report laments.\nEven 170 years after the report appeared, nothing has been done to restore this gigantic enterprise of ancient sovereigns. A bridge constructed by the British runs through the empty lake-bed, which could easily be restored to its former glory by linking it with the Kollidam, transforming it once again into a great reservoir.\nMr. Komagan, an engineer by training, lays out the map of the northern Cauvery system to explain how water from the Kollidam once filled tank after tank before flowing into the Veeranarayanapuram tank, known as Veeranam Lake, which then released surplus water into the river. The tank remains a testimony to the Cholas’ expertise in water management. Its bunds, strengthened with laterite stones, were built in an elliptical shape to withstand hydraulic pressure. Even after 1,000 years, these stones remain intact. “The sluices are a great feat of engineering, constructed with the ability to trap sediment brought in by the inlet canal,” Mr. Komagan says. Today, just one defunct sluice remains, protected by a concrete boundary from total destruction, thanks to his efforts. Another such sluice exists in Sri Lanka. He has asked the Tamil Nadu government to declare it a protected monument.\n“The square-shaped structure at the lower side of the tank contains a sediment trap linked with a silt ejector. The structure for releasing water [‘thoompu’], when the tank reaches its minimum capacity, is designed to create a vortex flow. This sucks the silt and deposits it into paddy fields, enriching them with nutrient-rich sediment,” Mr. Komagan explains. The sediment covering the fields was traditionally removed through the annual maintenance of waterbodies (‘kudimaramathu’). ‘Eri-ayam’, a levy for this purpose, was collected from local farmers.\nThe tank had once served as a stop-over for overseas birds migrating to the Kodiakkarai Bird Sanctuary. Its destruction has broken the chain of migration. It has also resulted in groundwater depletion in Gangaikonda Cholapuram and its neighbourhood. The water level has now dropped to 650 feet. “If restored, the tank will serve as a groundwater recharge zone. If the 12 lakes fed by the Kollidam are repaired, they can supply water to Chennai throughout the year,” Mr. Komagan says. In 1949, T.V. Sadasiva Pandarathar, in his workPirkala Cholarkal, recorded that many areas in Tiruchi and South Arcot districts remained fertile because of the water from this lake, which also served as a drainage outlet for the Veeranam Lake. “Thousands of acres can be irrigated with water from the lake at a time of famine,” he wrote."

In April, the SC had scrapped the entire 2016 State Level Selection Test (SLST) recruitment panel, and annulled 25,753 appointments of teachers for Classes 9-12 as well as Group C and Group D staff.\nIn the 2016 WBSSC recruitment tests, over 3 lakh candidates had applied for teaching jobs, another WBSSC official said.\nAfter the apex court’s April order, WBSSC had identified 15,403 out of 17,206 teachers as “not found to be specifically tainted”, allowing them to continue receiving salaries until December. The remaining 1,804 teachers have been barred from returning to schools.\nReferring to the April 3 verdict and the subsequent order on April 17, WBSSC had earlier said, “The commission and the State government have already applied for review of the said judgment and order, and this exercise is strictly subject to the outcome of the review petition and guidelines of the court to be followed by the commission and the government.”\nReacting to the fresh application process, Deserving Teachers’ Rights Forum office-bearer Chinmoy Mondal said, “We have nothing to say about the number of applicants. All we can say is those who had passed the 2016 exams cannot sit with their students who have graduated, done masters and now are aspiring to be teachers.”\n“After the SC order, the commission and the Education Department should not have undertaken the process in such a hurry, and instead, could have worked on presenting a water-tight case for ‘untainted teachers’ before the apex court,” he added."

In other words, there were 11 prospective parents for every child free for adoption in 2021.\nAs of mid-July 2025, the number of prospective parents has grown to 36,381 — an increase of about 9,600 from 2021 — while the number of children legally free for adoption has increased to 2,652 — only 222 more than in 2021. Currently, there are 13 prospective parents for every child free for adoption as shown in the chart below.\nThe rise in the number of prospective parents could be one reason behind the growing gap. “The number of people opting for adoption has substantially increased. Issues such as infertility are no longer the only reasons why parents consider adoption”, said Gayatri Abraham, the founder of Padme, a comprehensive adoption resource platform for Indian parents. Still, in a country where an estimated 3.1 crore children were orphans according to the 2020 World Orphan Report, the fact that only a couple of thousands were identified as free for adoption is difficult to justify.\nTamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and West Bengal accounted for over 50% of prospective parents in 2025, as shown in the chart below.\nThe average delay for prospective parents to get an adoption referral has increased from one year in 2017 to three years by 2022, to about 3.5 years currently. If CARA does not act soon, the delay will increase further in the coming years and “force parents to adopt a child illegally”, as warned by the Parliamentary Committee.\nThe Juvenile Justice Act (2021) lists out a time-bound procedure for a child in Child Care Institutions (CCI) to be declared legally free for adoption. Yet, the status of its implementation remains questionable. “There are so many stakeholders on the ground. Nobody is held accountable for not implementing”, says Smriti Gupta, co-founder of Where Are India’s Children, a Child Welfare and Action Foundation. She said that implementation could be a huge challenge due to resource limitations, lack of training, and a gap in linkages between adoption agencies and the CCIs. She added that the idea that every child deserves a family is not strong in India.\nData shows that over 22,000 children are in the CCIs, 8.5 times more than the number of children legally free for adoption, in 2025 (2,652). The children in the CCIs include those orphaned, abandoned, surrendered by parents and those who have parents/guardians who are unfit for parenting or do not visit them.\nThe process of declaring children in the CCIs as legally free for adoption remains a grey area. Smriti Gupta explained, “There are children whose parents keep them in the shelter because of economic issues. They might occasionally visit them. There is another set of kids who are completely abandoned/orphaned. Then, there are these kids in the middle, who have a guardian/parent on paper. And this person never visits the child, but exists only on paper. CARA is pushing to evaluate children with no visitation and an unfit parent/guardian, but needs a lot of follow up and follow through.”\nBecause of these complexities, not every child in the CCIs can be made free for adoption. Even after accounting for that, the gap between the number of children in these institutions and those entering the adoption pool is still quite high. For instance, in Himachal Pradesh, only one child is legally free for adoption in 2025, whereas 829 are in the CCIs, as shown in the chart below.\nIn Maharashtra, only 236 children are legally free for adoption, while 5,284 are in the CCIs. It will be a big leap to assume that these gaps are only due to the complexities stated above and the delay needs to be audited. The delay in declaring children legally free for adoption reduces their chances of getting adopted. Close to 34% of the children currently in the adoption pool fall in the 14-18 age group.\nAs the Parliamentary Committee had stated, “older children and children with special needs are usually not preferred for adoption by Indian parents”. Moreover, delay would make it harder for the child, who has been in the institution for so long, to adapt as well.\nThe longer wait times also have an impact on the registered prospective parents. Gayatri said, “Many parents start looking for children in the 0-2 group. Then, they see the waitline is three years, and become anxious. They then become willing to make the switch to adopt slightly older children, willing to jump the queue. Waitline shouldn’t be the reason one changes categories, especially not while going through the process.”\nSources: RTI reply received from the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the 2020 Orphan Report (INSAMER), and “Review of Guardianship and Adoption Laws”, by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances and Law\nsambavi.p@thehindu.co.in\nvignesh.r@thehindu.co.in"

A meeting with President\nDroupadi Murmu. A phone call from Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi. Reassuring pats on the back from Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi. A parade of AIIMS Bhubaneswar doctors, whose appointments are hard to come by, offering him full attention. His worn face splashed across newspapers, TV screens, and social media feeds. Calls from concerned relatives he hadn’t spoken to for a while. Strangers arriving at his village on the border between Odisha and West Bengal.\nA hundred hours have passed, yet Bala, 55, still can’t make sense of it. Why had his only daughter, abright, determined woman of 20 years, died?\nSukanya (name changed), a B.Ed. student, had set herself ablaze on July 12 on the premises of the Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College in Balasore, Odisha, according to eyewitnesses. She had been staging a protest against the college’s alleged inaction on her formal complaint of sexual harassment by the Head of the Department of Teacher Education, Samira Kumar Sahu. She succumbed to her injuries two days later while undergoing treatment at AIIMS Bhubaneswar.\nThousands of people who did not know her attended the cremation in her village, a gesture usually reserved for the rich and famous. Her death sparked widespread outrage, raising questions about the system’s efficacy to effectively address complaints of sexual harassment.\nSeated on a chair in the front yard of his home, surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar faces, a day after his daughter’s cremation, Bala can’t say much. “She is gone. What is the point of speech?”\nHe remembers that around noon on July 12, his mobile phone rang. He was in college, where he works as a clerk. He was informed that his daughter had just set herself ablaze outside the office of the principal, Dillip Ghosh, and was being rushed to hospital. “Before wild thoughts crossed my mind about what had happened, I gathered my family and we rushed there,” he says. From the district-level hospital, Sukanya was referred to AIIMS Bhubaneswar.\nOver the next few hours, many family members would travel 200 km from the village to see her. By then, the State government, worried about the political fallout, deployed an eight-member medical team to attend to the student, who had suffered 90% burns. She was put on a ventilator. The Chief Minister arrived at the Biju Patnaik International Airport from Delhi and proceeded directly to the hospital. State Congress president Bhakta Charan Das also visited the hospital to show his support.\n“I couldn’t even bear the sight of my daughter battling for her life. Her entire body was wrapped in bandages,” Bala says.\nOn July 14, the President delivered the convocation speech at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, where the fifth batch of students was graduating. However, the conversation was more about the allegation of sexual harassment and the critical condition of the woman than the institute’s journey.\nAfter concluding her speech, the President requested to visit the Burn Centre at the hospital. She was accompanied by Governor Hari Babu Kambhampati, the CM, and Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Hours after the President’s departure, the hospital issued a bulletin announcing the student’s death.\nAccording to her family, Sukanya was a hard-working student and secured admission in the college in 2023-24 based on her Class 12 marks. “My sister was multi-talented. She had taken training in martial arts to become a master trainer in self-defence in college. She was designated as anAapda Mitra(disaster response volunteer as part of a government programme) and even acted on stage,” says her brother.\nAccording to the family, Sukanya was a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and participated in its activities since her higher secondary school days.\nOn June 30, supported by ABVP members, she filed a complaint at the Sahadevkhunta police station alleging sexual harassment by Sahu. The police, along with her brother and ABVP members, then met Ghosh. She also approached local mediapersons and said she had been harassed.\nThe details of the meeting with Ghosh were documented in the police station diary, a record of all complaints before an FIR is registered. According to the police, they did not proceed with lodging an FIR as the principal had assured them that action would be taken within five days.\nThe following day, Sukanya wrote a formal complaint to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), a body that every organisation in India is mandated to have by law. She told mediapersons that she had submitted the complaint to the principal on July 1.\nAs per the complaint, she had met Sahu on a lawn in the college six months earlier and explained her academic struggles. He allegedly offered to help, but asked for a “favour” in return. Unsettled by the word, she asked what it meant. The teacher had, as per the complaint, said she was not a child and old enough to understand it.\nSukanya accused the teacher of sexual harassment and mental torture, demanding action. She said he had once threatened to ruin her academic career if she didn’t comply with his demands.\nOn the same day, she spoke to the media, detailing her allegations. She also took to X, tagging the CM, the Union Education Minister, the State Higher Education Minister, and the MP, MLA, and District Magistrate of Balasore, to bring attention to her allegations.\nAccording to Subhra Sambit Nayak, an ABVP member, Sukanya’s name was not on the list of students eligible to sit for the end-semester exam released on June 29. She had been missing classes, he says, citing different reasons: the self-defence programme she ran in college, her mother’s surgery, and the deaths of her grandparents. A member of the ICC said, on condition of anonymity, that Sukanya’s attendance did not go beyond 40%, falling short of the 75% needed to sit for the exam.\nHowever, Nayak claims that eight other students, who did not meet the attendance cut-off, were included on the list. He says despite Ghosh offering Sukanya a chance to appear for the exam, she chose to pursue her complaint formally.\n“She felt she was being singled out. Her complaint to the ICC was leaked and she had become the butt of jokes on social media,” Sukanya’s brother says.\nGhosh was suspended and a new principal appointed. The college did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.\nUnder the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) (POSH) Act, 2013, and the University Grants Commission (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Women Employees and Students in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2015, every institution needs to constitute an ICC.\nThe Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College’s website listed an ICC with the mandatory teaching and non-teaching staff, but did not list a student representative and an external independent member, both essential under the guidelines.\nAs per a notification from the college on July 1, it had appointed a social activist as the external member and three student representatives.\nThe following day, the notification was revised, with the name of a student representative replaced. Over the next five working days, the committee members spoke to the woman, her father, teachers, and classmates, and submitted a report on July 9.\nDuring this period, Sukanya, with other ABVP members, met Balasore Lok Sabha member Pratap Sarangi and sought his intervention. The MP later told mediapersons that he had spoken to the police and the principal.\n“After examining numerous stakeholders, we concluded that there was a lack of conclusive evidence to suggest that the teacher had sought favours from the woman. There was no one to corroborate the allegation,” says Gopamudra Mohapatra, an independent ICC member.\nOne of the controversies surrounding the student’s death is the power wielded by Heads of Departments (HoDs) in autonomous colleges. Here, HoDs play a dominant role: they design courses, finalise the list of examinees, set question papers, and decide who evaluates the answer scripts.\nSukanya’s brother and Nayak say that it was because of this power that her 60 classmates signed a petition certifying Sahu’s character a day after she had filed the complaint. They then submitted the petition to Ghosh.\nMinati Sethi, a teacher in the English Department and member of the ICC, says, “The committee had suggested changing the HoD and making the post rotational, but that was not accepted by all. The accused teacher remained in his place.”\nSukanya’s classmates also point out that Sahu would punish students for disciplinary issues by making them stand outside the classroom and perform yoga poses liketadasana(standing with hands outstretched over the head). An ICC member says one of the committee’s recommendations was that Sahu reform this behaviour.\nThe committee itself was constituted overnight, say members. The names on the website and those part of the final committee differ. Members say they did not have any understanding of the POSH Act and received no orientation on its provisions or guidelines.\nOn July 14, the Higher Education Department asked all colleges to form ICCs in accordance with the POSH guidelines within 24 hours. The committees had to be functional, with provisions to display names and phone numbers on noticeboards of colleges.\nGhosh later told the media that he had revealed to Sukanya that the ICC’s findings had gone against her and that she should let the matter be or face rustication. She became enraged and set herself on fire despite his attempts to calm her down, he said.\nSahu was arrested, Ghosh taken into custody, a high-level committee was formed under the Higher Education Department, and a probe by the Crime Branch was ordered. The National Commission for Women tooksuo motucognisance of the case and the National Human Rights Commission sought a response from the State government. The Odisha government announced an ex gratia of ₹20 lakh for Sukanya’s family.\nBoth the Opposition Congress and Biju Janata Dal observed State-wide bandhs. Former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said on X, “She did not lose her life solely to physical trauma, but to the indifference of a government that abandoned her in her fight. This is institutional betrayal — a planned injustice.”\nBefore consoling Sukanya’s father over the phone, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha accused the BJP government of pushing her to the brink. “This is not suicide; it is murder orchestrated by the system,” he asserted on X.\nOutside the college, students now hold candlelight marches to mourn Sukanya’s death. Whether she meant to take her life or not is difficult to say, but it will be entered into the records as death by suicide.\nIn response to a recent question in the Odisha Assembly, the CM said 72 students had taken their own lives in government and private schools and colleges from 2020 to February 2025. Some of the reasons attributed for taking the step were mental pressure, harassment, and mental health struggles.\n(If you are in distress, please reach out to the 24x7 helpline: KIRAN 1800-599-0019.)\nsatyasundar.b@thehindu.co.in\nEdited by Sunalini Mathew"

    "content": "A man who attempted to feed bananas to a wild elephant and was subsequently chased by the animal in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) has been fined ₹10,000 by the Forest Department.\nThe 27-km stretch of the Dindigul-Bengaluru National Highway (NH 948), from the forest check-post at Bannari in the foothills to the Karapallam check-post near Hasanur in the hills, passes through the core area of the reserve. Halting vehicles to take photographs or feed wildlife is strictly prohibited along this stretch to prevent human-animal conflict.\nOn July 13, a man travelling by car from Karnataka stopped his vehicle near the Bannari check-post, got down, and attempted to feed bananas to a wild elephant standing on the roadside. The elephant began to approach the vehicle, prompting the man to quickly get back into the car and drive away. A video of the incident went viral on social media.\nFollowing the video’s circulation, forest officials launched an investigation using the vehicle’s registration number. The individual was traced to Coimbatore and identified as Gopalakrishnan, 58, a resident of Teachers Garden in Annur taluk.\nHe was summoned to the Sathyamangalam Forest Range Office on Friday (July 17) for an inquiry. During questioning, Gopalakrishnan admitted to the act and acknowledged it as a punishable offence. A case was registered under the Wildlife Protection Act, and a fine of ₹10,000 was imposed by Kulal Yogesh Vilas, Deputy Director of STR and District Forest Officer of Sathyamangalam Division.\nTo raise public awareness, forest officials also recorded a video explaining the legal consequences of feeding wild animals and shared it on social media."

He contended that the reports were filled with inferences. The Judge said he was subject to intense media speculation and media trial. He was not given a fair hearing and an opportunity to respond to the allegations levelled by witnesses, amounting to a violation of the principles of natural justice.  The Judge said key questions like the source of cash and what caused the fire were not addressed in the committee report. The judge argued that the letter for his removal was forwarded by the then CJI within hours of receiving the inquiry committee report and without having a personal interaction with him.\nThe report of the committee, comprising Justices Sheel Nagu, G.S. Sandhawalia and Anu Sivaraman, concluded that Justice Varma and his family members were in “covert or active control” of access into the storeroom where the stacks of half-burnt cash was found. It had noted that the currency notes “seen and found during the process of dousing of fire” were “highly suspicious items” and not of a small value. They could not have been placed in the storeroom without the tacit or active consent of Justice Varma or his family, the report had submitted.\nThe inquiry committee had refused to accept the version of the judge that he was a target of a conspiracy. It said it would be “well-nigh impossible” to “plant” currency in a high security residential premises of a sitting judge, the panel had reasoned.\nThe inquiry panel had said “strong inferential evidence” established that the burnt currency was removed by Justice Varma’s trusted staff from the storeroom during the early hours of March 15.\nThe decision to form the three-judge fact-finding committee was based on a preliminary enquiry report submitted by the Delhi High Court Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya on March 21 recommending a “deeper probe” into the allegations."

My supporter, who was beaten, is being arrested while Padalkar’s five men who assaulted him are being protected by the police,” he said.\n“After the Thursday scuffle, police detained supporters from both sides. The assembly speaker told me that once the daily proceedings of the House were over, he would instruct the police to release my supporters, but it was not done. The supporters of Padalkar are being served vada pav and tobacco by the police,” Mr. Awhad alleged.\nMr. Deshmukh and Mr. Padalkar’s aide Rishikesh Takle were reportedly involved in the scuffle in the Vidhan Bhavan building on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nAs the situation escalated outside the legislature late at night, Mr. Awhad and his supporters attempted to prevent Mr. Deshmukh’s detention.\nReacting to the development, Mr. Padalkar termed Mr. Awhad's move of blocking a police vehicle as \"goondaism\".\nSpeaking to reporters on the premises of the Vidhan Bhavan, the BJP legislator said, \"I have apologised to the assembly speaker. My supporters made a mistake, and I requested the speaker to give them strict warnings. An FIR has been registered against the supporters.\"\nThe chairperson of the legislative council and the speaker were supreme in the Vidhan Bhavan, he said, adding that while he cannot comment on their decision, he respects it.\nAsked about the moments before the scuffle broke out, Mr. Padalkar claimed, \"I don't even know Nitin Deshmukh. I was on the steps of the Vidhan Bhavan for 15 minutes. I spent the whole day in the House.\"\n\"My supporters have been booked over the incident, and I respect it. We will face the case in court. My lawyers will represent them in court,\" he said.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, police used force to pull Mr. Awhad away from the police vehicle, dragging him from the road before deploying additional force to control the crowd.\nAdding a twist to the night’s drama, the police allegedly tried to discreetly shift Mr. Deshmukh using another vehicle, but Mr. Awhad spotted the move and confronted the officers again. NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar was also present at the scene after midnight.\nA violent clash broke out between the supporters of Mr. Padalkar and Mr. Awhad in the Vidhan Bhavan lobby on Thursday.\nShocking videos of the two groups pummelling each other and having to be dragged back by security personnel are doing the rounds on social media.\nThe altercation started with a verbal spat outside the assembly building on Wednesday, during which both MLAs and their supporters exchanged expletives."

The management failed to erect a barrier preventing children from climbing down to the awning from their adjacent classrooms”, Mr. Jayakumar said.\n“It is unfortunate that a tragedy had to happen and a young life snuffed out for the school and KSEB authorities to realise their folly. The commission prima facie views the serious lapses as culpable negligence and will move the government for appropriate action”, he added.\nMr. Jayakumar said the commission has sought reports from the police, the government-aided school management, the Parents and Teachers’ Association (PTA), the panchayat authorities and other entities as part of its investigation. He said he would file a detailed report to the government at the earliest."

    "content": "This yearfive Indian barshave made it to Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2025. Released on July 15 in Macau, the list features New Delhi’s Lair among its top-10 bars. But to anyone who has been paying attention to the country’s rapidly evolving cocktail culture, this is no surprise. With cutting-edge cocktail programmes, sleek interiors and menus that champion local ingredients, there has been a conscious effort to elevate Indian bars, by balancing between global trends and local flavours. The list (long-list included) has three bars from Bengaluru, two each from Goa and Delhi, and one from Mumbai. We speak to the people behind these bars, to find out their winning formula.\nDelhi’s Lair, which takes the eighth spot on the list, also won the Best Bar in India 2025 award by Asia’s 50 Best Bars. Its cocktails are inventive, and its ambience minimalist and edgy. On the official 50 Best website, Lair is described as a sleek hidden retreat. “The menu, divided into three levels — beginners, intermediate, and superior — guides patrons through a journey of flavour complexity.\nSignature cocktails include the Blueberry Cheesecake, infused with blueberry and cream liqueur, and the Mountain Breeze, inspired by the Himalayas, with regional infusions. Don’t let the extensive menu scare you, the friendly bartenders go out of their way to listen to preferences and suggest drinks suited to your taste and mood.”\nThe bar is designed in shades of black and grey, and the design aesthetic is almost Brutalist. Founder and managing director Jairaj Singh Solanki says, “We went with a unique design, monochrome concept. It feels like you are inside a cave. Lights are dim and we have spotlights on the tables. Colours are on the plates and drinks.” Delhi-based architecture and interior-design studio Renesa is the creative force behind the decor.\nBoilermaker in Goa is a new entry on the list, coming in at 30. The bar was founded in late 2024 by Nakul Bhonsle, a craft beer entrepreneur and Pankaj Balachandran, a mixologist. “India’s bartending community is stronger than ever. The quality of our bars continues to rise, and the industry is evolving. A few years ago, I said this was the best time to be part of this space — and this year proves that statement truer than ever. We’re not just growing; we’re thriving,” Pankaj says.\nSo what makes this bar in Siolim click? “Boilermaker is bringing back what a bar should be — unpretentious, laid-back, and full of soul. A true dive bar atmosphere where the priority is simple: good drinks, good times, and great people. At its heart, Boilermaker celebrates the classic shot-and-beer combo — no frills, just fun. But it is more than that. Walking in feels like stepping into a friend’s house party, where everyone is welcome and the vibe is effortless,” says Pankaj.\nThe drinks pay homage to Goa with Biso Manana Karamel, a twist on an Old Fashioned made with overripe Moira bananas and local feni. The food too has Goan touches, with tambdi bhaji sourdough melts and balchão stuffed pickled cucumbers.\nBoilermaker in Goa\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement\nThe Asia’s Best Bar official website says, “Everything about Boilermaker is carefully considered, but the feeling you get is one of a remarkably relaxed place that’s made to hang out with your gang. It’s a refreshing change as well as a reminder of that local flavour that defines Goa.”\nZLB23 in The Leela Palace Bengalururanks 31 on the list. The Kyoto-inspired bar has chic, vintage decor and skilled mixologists that shake up Prohibition era cocktails like Tokyo Bees Knees, Japanese Old Fashioned, and Bootlegger. The interiors make you feel like you could be in New York or London. “ZLB has carved a unique identity by blending theatrical storytelling with innovative cocktails and deeply personalised service. It is not just a bar but an immersive experience,” says Madhav Sehgal, area vice president, (operations south & Head of Sales – South India, The Leela Palace Hotels and Resorts. ZLB23 has invited more than 50 international and domestic bar takeovers in the past few years, making its presence felt on the global stage.\nA cocktail at ZLB23, Bengaluru\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement\nAt the same time, the bar is also honouring its roots. Madhav says, “Our newest ‘Native’ section is a tribute to the soil we stand upon, drawn from Bengaluru’s heartland, and crafted with ingredients that belong to these roots. For example, the drink Fire and Water is made with bhajji chilli, Coco Fizz uses tender coconut water and annanas has local rani pineapples.”\nAsia’s 50 Best Bars describes ZLB23 as “A stroll down a winding garden path, a trot through a bustling hotel kitchen and a short ride in a service lift: this brief journey, albeit confounding, is well worth it.”\n“This is one of the greatest times to be part of the Indian bar community,” says Arijit Bose, founder ofBengaluru-based Bar Spirit Forward, that is listed at number 37. “A bustling bar with a fun, boisterous crew manning the counters, Bar Spirit Forward is built for cocktail enthusiasts who appreciate craft, clarity, and context in their drinks. With a rich backstory led by industry veterans, including Arijit Bose, formerly of Countertop India and the team behind Goa’s Tesouro, ranked No.4 in Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2022, it focuses on creating a buzzy atmosphere that is punctuated by technically sound cocktails,” says the award list about this bar in the heart of the city.\nThe Bar Spirit Forward team\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement\nPerhaps because Arijit is a veteran in the industry, he knows it is the bartenders who make the bar work. Arijit says, “If closely examined, bartender-lead-and-owned bars are making a splash, which was always the key to building a good bar. To cite a few examples, Goa’s Hideaway, with Sheldon Abranches and Aditya Tribhuvan; Delhi’s Sidecar, with Yangdup Lama and Minakshi Singh; Bengaluru’s Soka, with Avinash Kapoli and Sombir Choudhary; Lair, with Navjot Singh at its helm — are all run by people who care about the business and craft. This will spur more people to open bartender lead programmes and venues similar to NYC, London, Thailand, Singapore or Tokyo.”\nWith three bars from Bengaluru on the list, there must be something the city is getting right. From being called the pub capital and the brewery capital, it may now be the craft cocktail capital of India. It is this spirit thatSoka (number 28) captures just right. “Bengaluru loves to chill. Our drinks try to do the same,” says Avinash Kapoli, the co-founder. “They are inventive without being pretentious, familiar without being boring. Whether it is a reimagined filter coffee cocktail for ourfragrance-paired menuor a highball with local ingredients, we build drinks the way this city lives. curious, complex, a little rebellious, and always laid-back.”\nThe team behind Soka in Bengaluru \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement\nHe says their bar programme is technical, but also human. The drinks are a tribute to old Bengaluru: Black Cadillac is named after an old pub on MG Road and Cheese Cherry Pineapple is an ode to a bar snack at Downtown Pub. “We didn’t build SOKA to follow a template. We built it to feel. Just damn good drinks, super snacks, honest hospitality, and a team that shows up every single night with heart.”\nWith inputs from Prabalika M. Borah and Priyamedha Dutta"

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday (July 18, 2025) asked the Centre to consider on its own merits anyrepresentation made by Nimisha Priya— International Action Council, a group fighting to save the life of the Malayali nurse awaiting execution in Yemen for murder, for permission to travel to the country and negotiate with the victim’s family for pardon and payment of blood money.\nA Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta was informed that theexecution, earlier slated for July 16, waspostponed owing to the efforts made by the governmentand Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musliyar, a revered scholar from Kerala.\nAttorney-General  R. Venkataramani expressed the government’s concern to bring Nimisha Priya back home safely. “All the government can do is being done,” he said.\nMr. Venkataramani urged the court to adjourn the case, saying “efforts were on” and to await further developments.\nSenior advocate Ragenth Basant, appearing for the Council, said the nurse’s mother was in Yemen and alone. She was a domestic worker, and unable to carry outany negotiations with the murder victim’s family.\nWho is Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, ‘the Grand Mufti of India’, who helped defer Nimisha Priya’s execution in Yemen?\nKanthapuram says his intervention succeeded in securing postponement of Nimisha Priya’s execution\nA mother is in Yemen to snatch her daughter from the jaws of death\nAcknowledging the help given by the government and the scholar, Mr. Basant, assisted by advocate Subhash Chandran, suggested a team consisting representatives from the government, the Council and the cleric could travel to Yemen to reach out to the family of the murdered man.\n“We have to get their pardon first. The family has to forgive us. After getting pardon, the blood money has to be decided,” Mr. Basant submitted.\nHe said there was a travel ban to Yemen. The government has to relax the restriction for the proposed team to go there and put the wheels into motion.\nHowever, Mr. Venkataramani reacted skeptically about Mr. Basant’s suggestion, remarking at one point that “I don’t think anything formally can happen at this time”.\nBut Justice Mehta said Mr. Basant was not asking for a direction, he was merely making a suggestion.\nThe top law officer said things were not simple as Mr. Basant made it out to be. In fact, the government did not want to risk doing anything which may turn counter-productive at this point of time.\n“It is not like we will grant permission and it will be possible for them to travel. There are so many issues — diplomatic inter-country relations involved. It is not easy. The government does not mind giving permission. But if it does not happen, why get involved and create a problem by which the real issue is not solved… We will consider… We do not wish to be counterproductive,” Mr. Venkataramani reasoned.\nMr. Basant said the government had given permission for the mother to travel to Yemen after approaching the Delhi High Court.\nThe Attorney-General said the family should be the only entity involved in such a situation while terming the Council as a ‘good Samaritan’.\n“What can an organisation that a government cannot do? We are concerned about this woman coming out safely. We do not want something counterproductive to happen. The government is pushing in various circles,” he said.\nPutting the ball entirely in the government’s court, the Bench listed the case on August 14.\nMs. Nimisha Priya was sentenced to death in Yemen by a trial court in 2020 for the murder of a local man, who was her business partner. Her appeals were dismissed by the appellate courts of that country.\n“Her only child, a 12-year-old girl, is living in a convent. Her mother is a domestic helper in Ernakulam and her husband is an autorickshaw driver,” the petition said."

His return comes a few days after a meeting with Governor and Chancellor of the university, Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, and amidst administrative tensions within the establishment.\nWhile mediapersons attempted to get a response from Mr. Kunnummal during his arrival both at the airport earlier and at the university premises, he declined to comment as he proceeded under tight security.\nDespite continuing its agitation against the Governor and the Vice-Chancellors appointed by him, the SFI did not organise any protests on the campus during Mr. Kunnummal’s arrival. The CPI(M)-feeder student body has stated that their decision was based on the pressing need to get the several pending certificates cleared by the Vice-Chancellor.\nLast week, the university had witnessed dramatic scenes when SFI activists stormed the university headquarters, shouting slogans against both the Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellor. Hundreds participated in the protest, which also led to arrests. Those detained were recently granted bail.\nWhile the situation conveys a semblance of normalcy, it remains to be seen what transpires within the top echelons of power at the university. The Vice-Chancellor has yet to accept the disputed reinstatement of Registrar K.S. Anil Kumar by the Syndicate, and has charged Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen with the additional charge of Registrar.\nMr. Kunnummal’s move to convene an Academic Council through Ms. Kappen, while ignoring repeated calls from Left-backed Syndicate members for an urgent Syndicate meeting, has further deepened the divide within the administrative circles."

Instead of blaming any party, they proposed collaborative solutions. Apart fromgender-sensitivity training for TGSRTC staff,and better-lit bus facilities, they suggested cleaner toilet facilities, and designated women-only buses during peak hours.\nAlso on the list of recommendations was a QR-code enabled complaint registering system in buses. They also sought collaborative policing, involving both uniformed and plainclothes personnel, and training bystanders to support fellow commuters.\nThe study suggested public-facing campaigns which would facilitate an approach of respect in public transport. These included sharing real stories of women passengers, and underscoring positive impact stories.\nTGSRTC Vice Chairman and Managing Director V C Sajjanar appreciated the efforts of students, and stated that training workers, bus tracking apps in the form of Gamyam, and collaboration with SHE Teams, apart from several similar passenger-friendly initiatives were already being implemented."

The temples associated with this community are located at Pappampatty village near Sulur, and their annual income is ₹40 lakh.\nAccording to the DVAC, the complainant and two others submitted a representation to Indira on March 18 this year to take over the administration of the temples, alleging that their administration and fund management were not proper and transparent.\nThe complainant also filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court, seeking directions to expedite the undertaking process. The High Court, in its order on June 16, ordered the HR&CE to complete the undertaking process within 12 weeks.\nThe DVAC stated that the complainant met with Indira several times to follow up. However, the officer demanded a bribe of ₹3 lakh, which she later reduced to ₹2 lakh. When the complainant enquired about the status of the undertaking process on Wednesday (July 16), she told him that the file was pending with her inspector. Indira repeated her demand for a bribe of ₹2 lakh, stating that she would recommend the undertaking process and send a report to the Commissioner of HR&CE. The amount was reduced to ₹1.5 lakh upon the request of the complainant.\nUnwilling to offer the bribe to Indira, the complainant approached the DVAC Coimbatore unit. A team headed by DVAC Additional Deputy Superintendent of Police M.P. Dhivya organised a trap and handed over currencies laced with phenolphthalein to the complainant.\nAs instructed by Indira, the complainant met her in front of a furniture showroom on Bharathiar Road at Pappanaickenpalayam between 7.55 p.m. and 8.15 p.m. on Thursday.\nAccording to the DVAC, Indira arrived the location by foot and instructed the complainant to place the cash into a yellow cloth bag that she had brought. She did not touch the currencies. Two official witnesses and the trap team observed the entire interaction from a distance. After receiving a signal from the complainant, the trap team approached the accused. The accused became nervous and placed the bag containing the bribe on the ground when the officials introduced themselves.\nA phenolphthalein test was conducted on Indira’s fingers and on the bag at a nearby shop. The DVAC stated that no visible colour changes were found in the washes from her fingers, but the test done on the bag turned positive. The tainted currency amounting to ₹1.5 lakh was recovered intact from the accused along with her yellow bag, it stated.\nThe DVAC added that a CCTV footage of Indira accepting the bribe was collected from a shop at the trap location. The officer was arrested following the trap late on Thursday."

    "content": "The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Friday (July 18, 2025) arrested Chaitanya Baghel, the son of formerChhattisgarhChief Minister Bhupesh Baghel,  in connection with themoney laundering probe linked to the alleged liquor scamin the State, said official sources.\nHe was arrested after fresh searches were conducted at the premises of Mr. Baghel in Bhilai town of Durg district, which the father-son duo share. The arrest was confirmed by ED sources even as visuals of sleuths taking away Mr. Chaitanya Baghel with them surfaced on TV channels. Congress supporters present there also tried to prevent the ED team from taking junior Baghel away by blocking the route of their vehicle.\n“ED is conducting a raid at the premises of Chaitnya Baghel, son of former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel, in connection with liquor scam,” said an ED source earlier, even as a heavy security contingent was seen outside the Baghel residence. In March, too, the ED had conducted similar raids against Mr. Chaitanya Baghel and sources said that fresh evidence had been received in the case.\nThe ex-CM meanwhile has claimed that the raids were an attempt to stop him from raising the issue of tree felling for the Adani group in the State legislative Assembly.\n“Today is the last day of the State legislative (monsoon) session. The issue of trees being felled for Adani in Tamnar was scheduled to be raised (in the House). Saheb has sent ED to Bhilai Niwas,” a message posted by his office on X said.\nHe was referring to the Tamnar tehsil of Raigarh district where villagers have been protesting against tree felling for a coal mine project in the area. The mine is allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (MAHAGENCO), which has contracted the MDO (mine developer cum operator) to the Adani group. Earlier this month, the senior Congress leader had visited Tamnar and extended support to the protesters.\nLater, addressing journalists he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah had sent ED to his residence to “please their master”. He also alleged that Opposition leaders throughout the country were being targeted.\n“On the one hand in Bihar with the help of Election Commission voters are being removed (from the voters list)..democracy is being stripped. On the other hand they are using ED, IT, CBI, DRI are being misused to suppress opposition leaders. But now our country’s people have understood and are well aware. ED has come in the past as well and raided my place and found Rs 33 lakh in my house. Now they have come again, what does this mean? We will fully cooperate....whether they trust or not we believe in democracy, judiciary. They (BJP) are misusing the agency but we will cooperate with them.”\nHe also noted that the raid was conducted on his son Chaitanya’s birthday, “Nobody in any democracy in the world can give a birthday gift like the one given by Modi and Shah.On my birthday, both the most respected leaders sent ED to the houses of my advisor and two OSDs. And now on my son Chaitanya’s birthday, ED team is raiding my house. Thanks for these gifts. I will remember them for life.”\nThe alleged liquor scam in Chhattisgarh, as per the ED, was orchestrated between 2019 and 2022 when Chhattisgarh was governed by the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government.  In 2024, the Supreme Court quashed the ED’s first ECIR (FIR) in this case, which was based on a complaint from the Income Tax Department. The federal agency later filed a fresh case after it asked the Chhattisgarh EOW/ACB to file a fresh FIR against the accused based on material shared by the anti-money laundering agency.\nThe EOW/ACB registered the FIR on January 17 last year, about a month after the BJP defeated the incumbent Congress government in the 2023 assembly polls, and named 70 individuals and companies, including former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma, former chief secretary Vivek Dhand and others. The ED had earlier told the court that the “scam” resulted in a “massive loss” to the state exchequer and filled the pockets of the beneficiaries of a liquor syndicate with over Rs 2,100 crore.\nIn a recent submission to the court, the EOW revised upwards the estimate of the loss caused to the exchequer due to the alleged scam, pegging it at Rs 3,200 crore.\n(With inputs from Devesh K Pandey)"

    "content": "What started off as a small experiment — a ₹2 “platform fee” on Swiggy in 2023 — has now grown into an industry standard across e-commerce and quick commerce platforms alike. The fee is no longer ₹2 either: Swiggy now charges ₹10 as a platform fee. There is GST applicable on top of this: one user fumed on social media site Reddit two years ago: “There’s now a GST on platform fee. A fee Zomato/Swiggy invented.” The fees are netting relatively modest sums — Zomato said in its report for the 2023–24 fiscal that the line item earned the firm ₹83 crore that year.\nBut they may be setting the stage for something larger: platform fees are now being charged across all major food and grocery delivery platforms, like BlinkIt, Swiggy, Zomato and Zepto. Even Amazon has started charging a ₹5 “marketplace fee,” something it doesn’t appear to charge users in other countries. Spokespeople for Swiggy and Zepto did not respond to a request for comment. A Zomato spokesperson said, “This fee helps us keep the app running smoothly, invest in product improvements, and continue delivering a smooth and convenient experience for our users. GST is applied as per government regulations and the restaurant’s confirmation.” Amazon said in a blog post when it started charging this fee last month that the surcharge is a “common industry practice,” and that it wouldn’t be applicable on bill payments and digital purchases.\nPlatforms generally have multiple sources of revenue in a single order: while food delivery players make money from restaurants by charging a commission of 15–25%, grocery delivery apps own the inventory they’re selling, pocketing the margins of the products flying out of their dark stores. But margins remain slim, Digvijay Ghosh, Partner of Consumer Products and Retail at EY-Parthenon toldThe Hindu.\nMr. Ghosh said it was “inevitable” that such fees would start being charged by platforms. “Obviously all the platforms are looking to have a focus on profitability and build on that,” he said. “Traditionally, there have been a lot of investments which the platforms have made in the shape of discounts, and in building the tech infrastructure which drives these platforms.”\nWhy not buff up prices elsewhere instead of adding a fee at checkout? Comparison shopping of sticker prices discourages that, Mr. Ghosh said, as consumers may tend to compare pre-checkout prices and shop based on that. The strategy has some risk of attracting buyers’ ire, Mr. Ghosh said: “I’m pretty sure that some of this will go through a bit of hit or miss depending on where they see consumers reacting adversely.”\nThe fees are a “growing concern from a consumer point of view,” Amol Kulkarni, director of research at the Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS), a consumer advocacy group and think tank, toldThe Hindu. “If it is becoming an industry standard, and all the players are in tandem appearing to increase their prices, there is a concern around anti-competitive practices and entities and platforms acting as a cartel to increase prices for consumers when a product is sold on platforms.”\nThere is a “transparency and information asymmetry” problem too, Mr. Kulkarni said. Conceding that players were free to increase prices — “I’m not suggesting for a second that we should regulate prices,” — Mr. Kulkarni says that there is nonetheless a need for “clear transparency in terms of what are the charges and the consumer should know them” upfront."

    "content": "The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, on Thursday (July 17, 2025), directed the Inspector-General of Police (South Zone) and the Madurai Commissioner of Police to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by a senior IPS officer with proven integrity, to conduct an investigation into thealleged property tax scam in Madurai Corporation.\nA Division Bench of Justices S.M. Subramaniam and A.D. Maria Clete sought a report from authorities while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by AIADMK Councillor T. Ravi (ward 83) of Madurai, who sought the transfer of the probe into the alleged scam to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The petitioner said that last year, information regarding the alleged scam surfaced in which several persons had benefited. Based on a complaint given to the Madurai Corporation Commissioner, a committee had been constituted to detect any irregularities.\nAfter receiving the report of the committee, the Corporation Commissioner lodged a complaint with the Madurai City Commissioner of Police. The scam, which occurred between 2022 and 2024, had caused a loss of around ₹200 crore to the civic body, the petitioner alleged.\nThough the complaint was lodged by the Corporation Commissioner in 2024, a case was registered only in 2025, after about seven months. There was a long delay in registering the case, he said, adding that action was being taken against the low-profile persons and not the real culprits.\nDuring the course of the hearing, it was contended that persons with political connections were involved in the scam, and as per the instructions of the Chief Minister, the Zonal Chairpersons had resigned from their posts.\nThe court said a scam of this magnitude had to be investigated by an IPS officer, and the probe should be monitored by higher authorities to ensure that there were no lapses, and that no one was left out of the ambit of prosecution. All those responsible for causing the huge loss to the civic body should be prosecuted, the court said, and posted the matter next week for further hearing."

    "content": "A year after the cyberattack against a multi-signature wallet that led to the loss of assets worth over $230 million, the cryptocurrency exchange WazirX stressed that it was committed to distributing users’ crypto as soon as possible via a restructuring exercise and a new vote.\nThe compromised wallet was managed with another company called Liminal,with both it and WazirX blaming each other for the vulnerability that was later exploited by North Korean cybercriminals. When the hack took place last July, WazirX was criticised for being slow to communicate the details of the incident to its users, and for causing confusion by locking up their funds after the breach.\nThis January, WazirX said it had frozen the first tranche of stolen assets, worth around $3 million.\nThe exchange took its restructuring exercise to the Singapore legal system despite marketing itself as an Indian crypto exchange, and pushed for a moratorium that would protect it from being hit with legal action.\nWazirX stressed that 93.1% of creditors voted in favour of the initial restructuring scheme.\nThe exchange announced this week that the Singapore High Court has set aside an earlier order on the matter where it rejected WazirX’s proposed restructuring plan, and has allowed a revote to be conducted based on an amended scheme.\n“This change requires a revote to reflect the updated framework, and we are ready. We have committed to speed from the start. Once the voting is over, the distribution of assets will take place within a few weeks,” said WazirX in its post.\nThe company further announced that in order to comply with updated legal and operational standards, it implemented a new structure that would see the FIU-registered Zanmai India entity managing the distribution of assets once its Scheme is approved and sanctioned by the court.\n“We moved fast, engaging global cybersecurity experts, collaborating with authorities, and securing a moratorium from the Singapore High Court to responsibly rebuild under legal oversight. We stayed transparent, hosting eight public townhalls, answering thousands of community questions, and partnering with top custodians like BitGo and Zodia Custody to strengthen asset security,” said WazirX in its post.\nHowever, the lack of swift and decisive action from the Indian authorities has upset a large section of WazirX customers from the same country, with many questioning why the status of their invested crypto is still being debated in a foreign court. Others are desperate to regain access to their crypto before prices crash, but the legal proceedings are ongoing.\nWazirX noted that its focus areas were to restore trust, distribute assets, and restart operations safely."

The agency had taken sanction for all the government servants, except him [Yadav]... The enthusiasm is telling,” Mr. Sibal said.\nAppearing for the CBI, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju countered that sanction was not required as the offence was allegedly committed prior to the 2018 amendment of the Act inserting Section 17A.\nMr. Sibal responded that the FIR however was registered in 2021, post the amendment.\nThe Bench said it did not want to look into the merits and facts of the case, which may be left to the High Court to consider."

The Constitution, in article 124, very clearly states that it is the MPs who move a motion — 100 MPs in the Lok Sabha or 50 MPs in the Rajya Sabha.\n\"We are supporting; our MPs are also signing the motion in the Lok Sabha, and this is not for an impeachment but for setting up of a three-member committee by the Speaker under the The Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968,\" he said.\n\"The committee will be set up, and it will investigate the matter, submit its report and on the basis of that report, presumably in the Winter Session of Parliament, there will be the process for the removal of the judge first in the Lok Sabha and then in the Rajya Sabha,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\nHe emphasised that there should be a proper investigation, citing that the action against Justice Varma was initiated based on an in-house committee report.\n\"...we are concerned about it, and there should be a proper investigation. The former CJI has forced our hand; he has submitted a report, there was no FIR and an FIR which should have been registered. He has virtually forced the hand of MPs by submitting the report to the president and to the PM based on an in-house committee report,\" the Congress leader said.\nReferring to Justice Yadav's issue, Mr. Ramesh said, \"He (Justice Yadav) violated his oath, and he violated all principles of the Constitution. Now, seven months have passed, and we still don't know. I have met (Rajya Sabha) Chairman (Jagdeep Dhankar) repeatedly, and still that motion is pending,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\"Whether he is sitting on it on his own or he is made to sit on it, I don't know. I respect the Chairman. I expected him... to give the go-ahead,\" he said and added,\" the least we expect is that a committee is set up to examine the behaviour of Justice Yadav.\" \t His remarks came on a day Justice Varma moved the Supreme Court seeking to invalidate a report by an in-house inquiry panel, which found him guilty of misconduct in the cash discovery row.\nJustice Varma has sought quashing of the May 8 recommendation by then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, urging Parliament to initiate impeachment against him.\nThe government plans to move a motion to remove Varma in Parliament's Monsoon session beginning July 21.\nA report of the inquiry panel probing the incident had said that Justice Varma and his family members had covert or active control over the store room where a huge cache of half-burnt cash was found, proving his misconduct, which is serious enough to seek his removal.\nThe three-judge panel headed by Chief Justice Sheel Naguof the Punjab and Haryana High Court conducted the inquiry for 10 days, examined 55 witnesses and visited the scene of the accidental fire that started at around 11.35 pm on March 14 at the official residence Justice Varma, then a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court and now in the Allahabad High Court.\nActing on the report, former Chief Justice of India Khanna wrote to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommending the judge's impeachment."

    "content": "Panic gripped residents of Kajaey in Vorkady panchayat in Kasaragod, Kerala, after deep cracks formed in the ground, prompting authorities to evacuate people from the area as a precautionary measure on Friday (July 18, 2025).\nAccording to officials, the cracks, reportedly over two metres deep, appeared in multiple spots, causing a section of the land to collapse. Local residents have raised safety concerns even as the cause of the cracks remains unclear.\nRevenue and disaster management officials have inspected the site.\nHazard analyst P.A. Shilpa said similar cracks had been reported earlier. It is suspected to be caused due to soil piping, also know as tunnel erosions.\nShe explained that it is a subsurface soil erosion process, where water flows through the ground, creating underground tunnels or channels that can eventually lead to the collapse of the soil surface. This process can cause significant land degradation and is a concern in areas prone to landslides and subsidence.\nShe said these cracks could have also be formed due to the operation of quarries, which could possibly be a contributing factor. “Vibrations from quarrying activities can accelerate the formation of such cracks,” she said.\nA report has been submitted that the areas is not suitable for residing, she added."

Kannaiyan, president of the Thalavadi Farmers’ Foundation, who counselled her family on the importance of institutional delivery and assured them of support.\nMs. Shevanthi, whose delivery was initially scheduled for July 7, 2025, had earlierrefused hospital admissiondespite repeated appeals from a health team comprising doctors Senthil Kumar and Vishnu and village health nurse P. Jothi. According to her relatives, she was afraid of institutional delivery and had taken shelter elsewhere, saying she would return once labour pain began. A complaint was lodged with the Thalavadi police after both Ms. Shevanthi and her husband Chandran went missing and their mobile phones remained switched off.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Kannaiyan visited their home and met Mr. Chandran’s mother, Nagiyamma, and sister, Madevi. He explained the risks associated with home delivery —a common preference among tribal womenin the region — and assured them that he would personally accompany Ms. Shevanthi to the hospital. After over an hour of discussion, the family agreed to bring her back.\nOn Friday, Mr. Kannaiyan met Ms. Shevanthi and her family again and reassured them. Ms. Madevi later alleged that a police officer had threatened the family with legal action if Ms. Shevanthi did not return, which caused distress. The officer later apologised for the same over the phone.\nFollowing this, the family consented to a hospital visit, and the health team was alerted. Doctors visited her home, checked her blood pressure, and took her to the Government Upgraded Primary Health Centre in Thalavadi around 11:30 a.m. for further examination. After the check-up, doctors advised immediate admission as labour could begin at any time. However, Ms. Shevanthi and Ms. Madevi insisted they would return only once the labour pain started. As they remained firm, they were dropped back home around 1:30 p.m.\nMs. Nagiyamma toldThe Hinduthat one of her daughters had suffered post-partum haemorrhage during a previous delivery, which left the family apprehensive. This fear, she said, had prompted her daughter-in-law to temporarily stay at a relative’s house in Gundlupet taluk, Karnataka. “We heard from other women that hospital deliveries are often complicated. That fear persisted,” she said.\nMs. Shevanthi said she had recently undergone a scan at a hospital in Chamarajanagar, Karnataka, where she was given a delivery date of July 27. “Since there is no labour pain yet, I stayed at the relative’s house,” she added.\nWhen asked about the discrepancy in the due dates, a health department staff member clarified that the July 7 date was based on a previous scan report. Deputy Director of Health Services P. Aruna could not be reached for comment."

The aircraft has been equipped with cloud seeding instrumentation, and its crew holds all the required licenses and certifications.\nMr. Sirsa clarified that the aircraft will avoid prohibited areas and no aerial photography will be conducted during the operation in strict adherence to aviation safety norms.\n\"We have taken all the necessary permissions, and the aircraft is fully ready. The cloud seeding will now take place in the first and second week of September,\" the Minister said, adding that \"the instrumentation work on the aircraft has been completed by IIT-Kanpur, and we are fully prepared.\"\nThe trials, which will be conducted using a Cessna 206-H aircraft (VT-IIT), will consist of five sorties over pollution-prone regions in north Delhi, including Rohini, Bawana, Alipur, and Burari, as well as parts of adjoining Uttar Pradesh, such as Loni and Baghpat.\nDuring the sorties, the aircraft will fly below the cloud base and release hygroscopic particles — such as sodium chloride and other aerosols — into the clouds to stimulate precipitation. This weather modification technique is aimed at inducing artificial rain that could help wash out airborne pollutants.\n“This is a scientific intervention to combat air pollution. If successful, it will open a new avenue for Delhi to deal with hazardous air quality, especially during the post-monsoon period,” Mr. Sirsa said."

    "content": "The stone edifice of Gangaikonda Cholisvaram, the Shiva temple more famously known as the Brihadisvara Temple, dominates the skyline of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram, a nondescript village in Udayarpalayam taluk of Ariyalur district in Tamil Nadu. It is hard to believe that the place was a throbbing capital of the Imperial Cholas for about 250 years. The city, its temple, and its massive lake called Chola Gangam remain the embodiment of the signal achievements of Rajendra Chola I (regnal years 1012-1044 CE).\nRajendra Chola I is famed for his exploits, but his military expedition to the Gangetic plains about a thousand years ago remains one of the most celebrated in the history of the Chola dynasty. TheTiruvalangadu, Esalam, and Karanthai Copper Plates, several inscriptions, and literary works celebrate his victory and the construction of the Brihadisvara Temple, listed as one of the three great living Chola temples by UNESCO.\nRajendra himself celebrated the victory by assuming the title ‘Gangaikonda Cholan’. He also built Gangaikonda Cholapuram, along with the Gangaikonda Cholisvaram — the jewel in his crown that rivals the Rajarajeswaram (also known as Brihadisvara Temple) built by his father in Thanjavur — and the Chola Gangam, excavated as ajalasthambam, a liquid pillar of victory.\nDuring the expedition to the Gangetic plains, Rajendra Chola I defeated several kings and chieftains, including the Kalinga ruler and the Pala ruler Mahipala of Bengal. According to the Tiruvalangadu Copper Plates, the vanquished kings were made to carry the Ganga water on their heads to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The water was poured into the Chola Gangam, now known as Ponneri. Rajendra Chola I also brought several beautiful Chalukya and Kalinga sculptures as war trophies.\nBut why did Rajendra Chola I shift his capital from Thanjavur? Many historians believe that one of the reasons could be that he wanted a bigger well-planned city to accommodate his huge army and serve his mercantile interests better. R. Nagasamy, the first Director of the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology, however, holds an interesting view. Rajendra Chola I, he says, probably had a “sentimental attachment” to the place which inspired him to attain phenomenal success, though it was unheard of even as a village when he came to the throne.\n“Tanjavur had been the Chola capital ever since it had been captured from the Muttaraiya chieftains by Vijayalaya... Tanjavur served the interests of the Cholas well... Yet, within a few years of the erection of the great temple [Rajarajeswaram] and within a few years of his [Raja Raja I] passing, his son, Rajendra, shifted his capital to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Was this because Gangaikonda Cholapuram served strategic purpose better than Tanjavur (but Tanjavur had better claims with its fortifications and natural river barriers)! No answer is possible except for a suggestion that it was probably here that Rajendra resolved to despatch a military expedition to the Gangetic plain,” says Nagasamy in his book,Gangaikondacholapuram, published by the department in 1970.\nGangaikonda Cholapuram remained the capital from 1025 CE till the fall of the Chola dynasty till 1279 CE. “As the capital of the Cholas from about 1025 AD for the about 250 years, the city controlled the affairs of entire south India, from the Tungabhadra in the north to Ceylon in the south,” says Nagasamy. It was the second largest and important city in the 11th-12th Centuries and the centre of political, commercial and cultural activities, like Madurai in Pandyanadu and Karur in Cheranadu, says Natana Kasinathan, another former Director of the Department of Archaeology. Yet, there is no inscription of Rajendra Chola I in the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple, a spectacular gallery of Chola art and architecture. It is from an inscription of his son Vira Rajendra that it is known that his father had built the temple. Details about the palace and other parts of the city are found in the epigraphs of Rajendra’s successors, says Kasinathan in his book,The Metropolis of Medieval Cholas. The inscription of Vira Rajendra, the third son of Rajendra, refers to the palace at Gangaikonda Cholapuram as Chola-Keralan Thirumaaligai, evidently named after one of the titles of Rajendra I.\nGangaikonda Cholapuram had been a bustling city with a fort, palaces, and well-planned streets. “In an inscription dated in the 49th year of Kulottunga (1119 AD,) a reference is made to Gangaikondachola maaligai at this place. It is likely that there were more than one royal building, each having its own name. Besides, the names of the palace and fort walls, the names of a few roads and streets are preserved in the epigraphs,” says Kasinathan.\nThe city is celebrated in Tamil literature too. An elaborate description of the citadel comes fromMuvar Ulaof Ottakuttar.Rajaraja Cholan Ulagives an account of almost all the important places of the city. The city is referred to as Gangapuri inKalingattuparani, composed by Jayankondar.\nThough there have been attempts to excavate and showcase the past glory of the city in the recent times, the fortunes of Gangaikonda Cholapuram seems to have come a full circle. “This capital of the most powerful empire in Asia at one time is now desolate, only the temple survives. To those who know of the brilliant history of the Chola empire, it is a tragedy,” writes Nagasamy. As he explains, the Pandyas, who put an end to the Chola empire in the 13th Century, avenging their defeats, “should have razed the city to the ground”. One thousand years have passed since the sacred Ganga water was brought to this city, and the millennium deserves to be commemorated as a fitting tribute to the emperor who founded the city, says R. Komagan, chairman, Gangaikonda Cholapuram Development Council Trust."

    "content": "Rajendra Chola I, the illustrious son of Raja Raja Chola I, expanded the frontiers of the Chola empire beyond the Indian subcontinent. Not onlymilitary conquestsacross South and Southeast Asia but also generous land grants and temple patronage marked his reign (1012-1044 CE). Among the most valuable records from Rajendra Chola’s time are four sets of copper plate inscriptions discovered at different locations across Tamil Nadu.\nThese inscriptions shed light on Chola lineage, temple endowments, and military expeditions. The books,Sozhar Ceppedugalby Ve. Mahadevan and Ka. Sankaranarayanan (Tamil University, Thanjavur) andSozhar Kaala Ceppedugalby former IAS officer M. Rajendran (Akani Publishers), provide insights into copper plate inscriptions of various Chola kings, especially Rajendra Chola.\nThe Tiruvalangadu Copper Plates were first mentioned in the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for 1903-04. A detailed account appeared in the Madras Epigraphical Report of 1916. The plates were later published in Volume III ofSouth Indian Inscriptionsby epigraphist Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri. This set comprised 31 copper plates, with the first 10 inscribed in Sanskrit and the remaining 21 in Tamil. The inscription was divided into three parts: the Sanskrit section, the first Tamil section, and the second Tamil section. According to epigraphist V. Venkayya, the Tamil parts were considered earlier, with the Sanskrit section possibly added later. The second Tamil section referred to the sixth regnal year of Rajendra Chola I, placing it around 1018 CE.\nThe circular seal in Tiruvalangadu copper plates.

Srinath\nThe plates were linked together by a circular copper seal with royal emblems, including two fly-whisks on either side of a royal parasol, a tiger (the Chola emblem), two fishes (the Pandya emblem), a bow (the Chera emblem), a boar (the Chalukya emblem), a Swastik, and two lamps. Weighing 93.05 kilograms, these plates recorded the royal order of Rajendra Chola gifting Palaiyanur village to the Tiruvalangadu Shiva temple (in Tiruvallur district).\nThe Sanskrit section, with 271 lines, traced the Chola genealogy in a mythological lineage starting from the Sun. The Tamil section contained 524 lines, of which 145 lines described the royal order, 281 lines described the boundaries of the land grants, and 98 lines outlined the tax exemptions and other privileges.\nThe Karanthai Copper Plates were discovered in a field at Puthur village near Ammapettai in Papanasam taluk of Thanjavur district. Initially referred to as the Puthur Copper Plates, they were renamed after being preserved by the Karanthai Tamil Sangam at Karunthattankudi, near Thanjavur, in the late 1940s. They had reportedly been discovered six decades earlier on land belonging to Sevu Pandiyan. The Karanthai Tamil Sangam acquired the plates with assistance from a local development officer.\nThe Karanthai copper plates of Rajendra Chola. File \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                M. Moorthy\nThe set comprised 57 copper plates, weighing 111.73 kilograms, linked by two large copper rings, one of which was broken. The remaining ring bore the royal seal featuring the emblems of the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Cheras, and the Chalukyas, along with lamps, the royal parasol, and fly-whisks. Scholars identified three distinct sections, likely composed at different stages. The first section, written in Sanskrit and numbered continuously, appeared to have been compiled later. The second section, consisting of 22 plates inscribed in Tamil with 1,042 lines, detailed a major land donation. The third section, also in Tamil, comprised 32 plates and 1,456 lines, recording information about temples and listing land grants to 1,080 Brahmins. Several of the 54 Tamil plates bore the word ‘Thiribu’, referencing the gifted village — Thiribhuvana Mahadevi Chaturvedimangalam — named in honour of Rajendra Chola’s mother. The plates were issued in 1020 CE (his eighth regnal year).\nThe Tirukkalar Copper Plates were discovered at the Parijathavaneswarar Temple at Tirukkalar, a village nearly 20 kilometres southeast of Mannargudi, in Tiruvarur district. The temple yielded a set of five copper plates inscribed in Tamil and 23 stone inscriptions, all from the Chola period. The five plates, weighing 6.59 kilograms, were linked by a copper ring. The earliest among them was dated to around 1030 CE (the 18th regnal year of Rajendra Chola).\nThese plates detailed a land grant made to the Mahadevar Temple at Tirukkalar, which was part of the ‘Purangkaranbai Nadu’ in the ‘Arulmozhi Deva Valanadu’. Of the 30 lines inscribed on the plate, 28 narrated the king’s genealogy and achievements, while the final two lines detailed the land donation.\nThe Esalam Copper Plates were discovered at Esalam near Tindivanam on July 11, 1987, during the renovation of a Shiva temple. The finds included 15 copper plates, several bronze icons, and ritual objects. Esalam was the first site where all three types of historical artefacts were unearthed together. A similar triad was later found at Tiruindalur (in Mayiladuthurai district) in 2010.\nR. Nagasamy, then Director of the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology, studied the plates and confirmed that they belonged to the reign of Rajendra Chola. They were dated to 1036 CE (his 24th regnal year). Among the bronze icons was a statue of Sarva Siva Pandithar, believed to be Rajendra Chola’s guru.\nThese plates, engraved on both sides, were bound by a copper ring with a seal bearing the emblems of the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Cheras, and the Chalukyas, along with lamps, the royal parasol, and fly-whisks. The plates contained 424 lines: 80 in Sanskrit and 344 in Tamil. The inscriptions opened with Rajendra Chola’s genealogy in Sanskrit. The Tamil portion detailed his land grants to the temple built by Sarva Siva Pandithar and listed the regions conquered during his reign. His ‘meikeerthi’ (royal eulogy) said the famous Vidyadhara Torana was brought from Kadaram (Kedah in Malaysia) and was depicted on the seal of this set of copper plates."

    "content": "Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has slammed the Kerala government for the alleged lack of accountability in all departments, which he said had led to the unfortunate electrocution of a 13-year-old boy at a school in Thevalakkara, Kollam on Thursday (July 17).\nIf the government and the education departments cannot ensure the safety of children in schools, then the people have no use for such authorities. The government should immediately conduct a safety audit in all schools across the State and ensure that the physical infrastructure in schools are not in peril, Mr. Satheesan demanded.\nHe raised alarm over the safety of children in schools, with deaths from snake bites or electrocution being reported in recent years. The Opposition had raised the demand for a safety audit five years ago when a 10-year-old had died in Wayanad following a snake bite inside a school classroom. Yet, nothing was done till date, he said.\nHe questioned how the school at Thevalakkara was given the fitness certificate when the power lines were drawn so close to the roof where Mithun had climbed to retrieve his sandals. It is to be revealed whether the school was given a fitness certificate because the management is dominated by the CPI(M) or if the school was being run without a fitness certificate whatsoever, Mr. Satheesan charged.\nThe Opposition leader alleged that all important departments of the government – Health, Higher Education and General Education – were in disarray, with none having any accountability. He demanded that the government order a comprehensive investigation into the incident at Thevalakkara Boys’ High School and ensure that such negligence never occur in any schools in the State."

The people are turning towards the BJP with hope. Watch from Durgapur.https://t.co/SZMEEM8rmb\n“Today, the entire world is discussing the resolve for a developed India. Behind this, there are changes visible in India, on which the edifice of a developed India is being built. A major aspect of these changes is India’s infrastructure,” the Prime Minister said.\nReiterating his government’s vision of ‘One Nation, One Gas Grid’, Modi said the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project was conceptualised to ensure equitable energy access and spur industrial growth across eastern India.\nAs part of the day's events, the PM laid the foundation stone for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) ₹1,950-crore City Gas Distribution project in Bankura and Purulia districts. The project aims to supply piped natural gas (PNG) to households and industries and compressed natural gas (CNG) at retail outlets and generate employment in the region.\nHe also dedicated to the nation the ₹1,190-crore Durgapur–Kolkata section (132 km) of the Durgapur–Haldia Natural Gas Pipeline, laid under the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga (PMUG) initiative. Passing through Purba Bardhaman, Hooghly and Nadia districts, the pipeline is expected to benefit lakhs of people with a steady and clean supply of natural gas.\nContinuing the Centre’s thrust on clean energy, PM Modi dedicated Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems retrofitted at the Durgapur Steel and Raghunathpur Thermal Power Stations of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). Built at a combined cost of over ₹1,457 crore, the systems aim to curb industrial emissions and improve air quality in the region.\nIn the rail sector, the Prime Minister inaugurated the doubling of the 36-km Purulia–Kotshila rail line, completed at a cost of over ₹390 crore."

If you could see the result, it was very shocking, and poor performance in each year’s examination is a stigma to the district’s educational growth,” he said and added that the Deputy Commissioner and CEO should frame initiatives that are strictly implemented to improve the results.\nHe suggested to appoint district-level officers for each village and taluk-level officers for each school and to ask them to work effectively to ensure improvement in the results from this year itself. “Normally, the SSLC and PU students may find difficulties under fear in attending exams. The special classes and short tests should be conducted to eradicate such examination fear among them, as the Education Department should immediately start work on it,” the Minister said.\nThe Minister turned down the opinion that a shortage of teaching staff is a prime cause for poor performances. He said that the performance has become poor because of the Education Department’s failure in monitoring the method of teaching and quality of the education provided.\nHighlighting the importance of green coverage and expressing concern about raising pollution, Dr. Patil directed the forest and other concerned departments to plant at least 10,000 trees in the city limits every year to maintain the good and pro-human environment.\nMLA Basanagouda Daddal demanded a taluk hospital for rural area people. Both MLC’s Basanagouda Badarli and Sharanagouda Patil Bayyapur urged the appointment of teachers exclusively for the computer sources in various schools in Sindhanur taluk and also the establishment of a 50-bed critical care centre in Lingsagur.\nBasanagouda Turviha and Karemma G.

    "content": "A few kilometres away from the Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram lies a tank stretching over 17 km. Chola Gangam, locally known as Ponneri, was dug by Rajendra Chola to celebrate his northern campaign. Historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, author ofThe Cholas, citing theTiruvalangadu Copper Plates, notes that “at the end of the expedition, Rajendra erected a ‘liquid pillar of victory’ (ganga-jalamayam jayastambham) in his capital with the waters of the Ganga in the form of the tank Cholaganga.”\nBut the 1,000-year-old lake is in ruins. Once spread over 16 miles, the tank has shrunk to 17 km. It remains dry for most of the year as the canals that brought water from the Kollidam have long been abandoned. Yet, traces of these canals remain. Locals believe that the proposed visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27 and the government’s plan to release a commemorative coin could shed much-needed light on the lake. “The lake depends on surface water collected during the rains. It is a pity that the tank, which once supplied water to Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the 60-acre palace, is in such a pathetic state,” says R. Komagan, chairman of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram Development Council Trust, who has been fighting for years to restore the lake.\nThe Trichinopoly Gazetteer, authored by F.R. Hemingway, records that the tank once irrigated 1,564 acres of land, its primary purpose being to supply drinking water to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Sastri also reproduces a report on the tank that appeared in a local publication in 1855: “There is an embankment 16 miles long, running north and south, provided with several substantial sluices and of great strength, which in former times must have formed one of the largest reservoirs in India.” According to the same report, when the palace was still in existence, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was a wealthy and flourishing capital, and the great tank spread fertility over miles and miles of what is now trackless forest. “It has been projected to restore that magnificent work, but the scheme has remained in abeyance for want of engineer officers,” the report laments.\nEven 170 years after the report appeared, nothing has been done to restore this gigantic enterprise of ancient sovereigns. A bridge constructed by the British runs through the empty lake-bed, which could easily be restored to its former glory by linking it with the Kollidam, transforming it once again into a great reservoir.\nMr. Komagan, an engineer by training, lays out the map of the northern Cauvery system to explain how water from the Kollidam once filled tank after tank before flowing into the Veeranarayanapuram tank, known as Veeranam Lake, which then released surplus water into the river. The tank remains a testimony to the Cholas’ expertise in water management. Its bunds, strengthened with laterite stones, were built in an elliptical shape to withstand hydraulic pressure. Even after 1,000 years, these stones remain intact. “The sluices are a great feat of engineering, constructed with the ability to trap sediment brought in by the inlet canal,” Mr. Komagan says. Today, just one defunct sluice remains, protected by a concrete boundary from total destruction, thanks to his efforts. Another such sluice exists in Sri Lanka. He has asked the Tamil Nadu government to declare it a protected monument.\n“The square-shaped structure at the lower side of the tank contains a sediment trap linked with a silt ejector. The structure for releasing water [‘thoompu’], when the tank reaches its minimum capacity, is designed to create a vortex flow. This sucks the silt and deposits it into paddy fields, enriching them with nutrient-rich sediment,” Mr. Komagan explains. The sediment covering the fields was traditionally removed through the annual maintenance of waterbodies (‘kudimaramathu’). ‘Eri-ayam’, a levy for this purpose, was collected from local farmers.\nThe tank had once served as a stop-over for overseas birds migrating to the Kodiakkarai Bird Sanctuary. Its destruction has broken the chain of migration. It has also resulted in groundwater depletion in Gangaikonda Cholapuram and its neighbourhood. The water level has now dropped to 650 feet. “If restored, the tank will serve as a groundwater recharge zone. If the 12 lakes fed by the Kollidam are repaired, they can supply water to Chennai throughout the year,” Mr. Komagan says. In 1949, T.V. Sadasiva Pandarathar, in his workPirkala Cholarkal, recorded that many areas in Tiruchi and South Arcot districts remained fertile because of the water from this lake, which also served as a drainage outlet for the Veeranam Lake. “Thousands of acres can be irrigated with water from the lake at a time of famine,” he wrote."

    "content": "The district authorities are likely to take a decision soon on the repair and reconstruction of the damaged portion of the bed protection wall near the Kollidam bridge, which was washed away during the surplus discharge in the river in 2024.\nResponding to concerns raised over the damaged wall causing one-sided flow in the river at the monthly farmers’ grievances meeting here on Friday, District Collector V. Saravanan said  he would visit the site soon to work out a solution.\nThe State Highways Department had built the bed protection wall across the river in 2024 as a protective measure to check sand erosion around the pile foundation of the new bridge built across the Kollidam a few years ago in the city.\nIn August 2024,  a portion of the wall was dislodged for a length of 30 metres due to the heavy water flow in the river. The previous Collector M. Pradeep Kumar had later said at a farmers grievances meeting that the contractor who had built the structure would be asked to restore it.\nHowever, the bed protection wall is yet to be repaired. Raising the issue at Friday’s grievances meeting, P. Ayyakannu, president, Desiya Thennidiya Nadigal Innaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, said with the surplus water being discharged in the Kollidam again from Mukkombu now, the water was flowing only on the one side of the river through the damaged portion of the wall. This could prove to be dangerous and cause deep erosion on one side of the river. A school situated along the river banks could be flooded, he said.\nA senior official of the Water Resources Department conceded that the water flow was concentrated on one side of the river and said they had taken up the matter with the Highways Department. It was better to remove the wall, if it was not restored, he added.\nMr. Saravanan directed the official to schedule an inspection so that he could assess the situation first hand.\nSources in the Water Resources Department toldThe Hinduthat the Highways Department was keen to reconstruct the damaged portion of the wall by providing a deeper foundation and retain the structure. A joint inspection would be conducted soon and a proposal was likely to be drawn up."

The event is an attempt to inform the people of the State about the achievements of the State government in the backdrop of false propaganda spread by the BJP, the Chief Minister said.\nReferring to the launch of schemes worth ₹2,658 crore at the ‘Sadhana Samavesha’, the Chief Minister asked whether they would hold such a function for nothing. Further, he asked the BJP to list out its contribution in the development of Mysuru.\nAccusing the BJP of spreading false information that the State government did not have funds to implement the guarantee schemes, Mr. Siddaramaiah wondered whether the government will be able to spend ₹2,568 crore for just one city if it was bankrupt.\nThe Chief Minister also dismissed speculations about the “September revolution” amid reports about a change of Chief Minister in the State, and asked reporters to pose the question to the people who were speaking about the same. Even if the people who are talking about it were from the Congress party, they had not told him about it, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.\nIn regard to BJP State president B.Y. Vijayendra’s challenge to name All India Congress Committee president Mallikarjun Kharge as the party’s Prime Ministerial candidate, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the BJP leader should ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make way for a Dalit.\nWhen asked about the stance of the Congress, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that everybody in the party gets an opportunity. Only the Congress is committed to social justice, he added."

The State has also earned global recognition, ranking third internationally in aerospace production. A project of this scale and importance should not be shelved but rather relocated to a region that is more receptive and suitable for such development,” Mr. Bellad has said in the letter.\nConsidering these aspects, the State government should consider shifting the aerospace project to any part of North Karnataka including Hubballi, Dharwad, Belagavi or others, he said adding that the region offered several advantages including a large and skilled human resource base, the availability of land, and existing infrastructure support.\nWhat was even more important was that North Karnataka had long remained under-industrialised and economically underserved. Locating the aerospace project in Hubballi or other parts of North Karnataka would not only ensure the continuation of this strategically significant investment but also the industrial growth in the region, he has said.\nBellad has said that such a move would also serve the dual purpose of preserving the State’s leadership in the aerospace sector and also promoting balanced regional development."

    "content": "Ruling out the possibility of the State government succumbing to pressure from any quarter over the Dharmasthala burials case, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday said the State government would act based on the report to be submitted by the police in the ongoing investigation as per law.\nFielding queries from reporters on the demand for the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the complaints of rape, murder, and burials in Dharmasthala, Mr. Siddaramaiah made it clear that the government was neither in favour nor against the demand. The government would act as per law.\n“If an SIT has to be constituted, it will be constituted,” he said before adding that the government’s course of action in the matter will be dependent on the report of the police investigation, which, he said, was expected in a day or two.\nMr. Siddaramaiah said the complainant, a former sanitation worker who had claimed to have buried “hundreds of bodies”, was absconding for about 10 years before surfacing and making a statement before the police. He has informed the police that he has buried the corpses and has offered to show the spots of the burials. “Let us see what the police investigation report says,” the Chief Minister said.\nMr. Siddaramaiah also made it clear that there was no pressure on the government over the probe. “The government will act as per law,” he said.\nOn Thursday, retired Supreme Court judge V. Gopala Gowda, addressing media persons, demanded an SIT probe, monitored by either a incumbent or retired judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, into the Dharmasthala case.\nMr. Gowda said the complainant, who had recorded his statement before the magistrate, was already under pressure from the police. “The police are allegedly coercing him to mark the places where he had buried the bodies on a white paper. Also, the statement of the whistleblower is being leaked to private individuals,” he said.\nHe further said that even days after the whistleblower lodged a complaint and recorded his statement before a magistrate, the police seem to be in no hurry to organise the exhumation of these remains. The police have not even visited the spot. This raises serious questions about the intentions of the current investigation,” he said, demanding the constitution of an SIT led by an Additional Director-General of Police (ADGP) rank officer, monitored by an incumbent/retired judge of the Supreme Court or High Court."

    "content": "TheSupreme Courton Friday (July 18, 2025) rejected an appeal filed by Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) MP P.V. Midhun Reddy challenging theAndhra PradeshHigh Court’sdecision to deny him anticipatory bailin the liquor scam case.\nA Bench headed by Justice J.B. Pardiwala dismissed the special leave petition filed by Mr. Reddy, who was represented by senior advocates A.M. Singhvi and Mahfooz A. Nazki, after briefly hearing submissions by both sides.\nAlso read:Midhun Reddy is one of primary executors; played instrumental role in liquor scam: Andhra Pradesh CID\nMr. Singhvi argued that the High Court had erred in itsJuly 15 order, asserting that his client was no “fly-by-night operator” but a three-time Member of Parliament and a person of high repute.\nHe submitted that there was no justification for arresting Mr. Reddy, particularly when there were no substantive allegations against him and the case was entirely false.\n“The entire endeavour of the State is to harass the petitioner and to injure and humiliate him by having him arrested,” Mr. Reddy’s counsel argued.\nAppearing for the State, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended that in May, the same Bench of the top court had refused anticipatory bail to K. Dhananjaya Reddy and P. Krishna Mohan Reddy, both of whom had served in former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s office during the previous YSRCP regime.\nThe court had at the time observed that pre-arrest bail would “come in the way of the investigating agency if it wanted their custodial interrogation.” Like Mr. Reddy, the two co-accused had claimed that the case was politically motivated and reflected bias on the part of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP).\nIn the present plea, Mr. Reddy’s side narrated that the State had initially stated before the High Court that he had no role in the case and was not even named as an accused. However, the government later altered its stand, even deputing police teams to New Delhi to arrest the MP. The petition described the State’s change in position as “shocking” and “beyond comprehension”.\nThe plea further said that the “evidence” cited by the State involved a ₹5 crore transaction between PLR Projects Private Limited and M/s D-Cart Logistics.\n“It is contended by the State that the petitioner is connected to PLR Enterprises, and therefore, the money is directly traceable to him. The allegation is ex facie incorrect as the petitioner is neither a director nor a shareholder of the company. While it is correct that some of the family members of the petitioner are shareholders/directors of the company, the same, by itself, cannot implicate the petitioner,” the petition stated.\nThe arguments, however, did not find favour with the top court."

More importantly, they are betraying Tamil Nadu and running a “National Dictatorship Arrangement” regime, Mr. Stalin said in a post on X.\n“I have instructed the MPs to reflect the voice of people in India and Tamil Nadu in the monsoon session and safeguard State’s financial, linguistic, educational and federal rights,” Mr. Stalin said.\nAccording to a party release, the meeting adopted a resolution to uphold State’s rights on various aspects.\nAs per the resolution, DMK MPs will put forth the points raised by Mr. Stalin during the 10th Governing Council meeting of NITI Aayog chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 24.\nThis includes a new scheme for cleaning of major rivers - Cauvery, Vaigai, and Thamirabarani, naming Union government schemes in English, it said.\nThe MPs will also raise the issue of denial of  Samagra Shiksha funds to Tamil Nadu for not implementing the Centre’s three-language policy, while similar funds released to BJP-ruled Maharashtra that withdrew the policy following opposition, the resolution noted.\nThe MPs would also seek 50% devolution to States and also flag the issue of States getting only  33.16% of devolution against the 15th Finance Commission recommendation of 41% and the financial strain on the State government due to its increasing share in schemes implemented along with the Central government, it said.\nAs per the resolution, the MPs will raise the issue of Centre’s non-acceptance of Keezhadi archaeological report and non-release of funds for the railway projects to Tamil Nadu and under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme.\nThe DMK will take up the delay in restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and also the issue of\nSpecial Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls in Bihar and misuse of Election Commission.\nArrest of Tamil fishermen by Sri Lanka, Katchatheevu retrieval, moving education back to State list are among the other issues in the agenda."

Muniyappa said here on Friday that the five guarantee schemes of the Karnataka government were in sync with the vision of B.R. Ambedkar and Babu Jagjivan Ram, and that the government was serving the cause of social justice.\nHe was speaking at a seminar on “Contributions of Babu Jagjivan Ram” conducted by the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU). Resource persons and speakers paid tribute to Jagjivan Ram’s commitment to social justice and empowerment of the socially oppressed classes.\nMr. Muniyappa said that Jagjivan Ram gave a voice to the oppressed section of the society, and like Ambedkar, used caste as a tool for social justice. This, he said, has to be contrasted with the present times where some forces use caste as a political weapon.\nHe referred to the SC/ST Sub-Plan Act, 2013, introduced by the Congress government in the State, and pointed out that it mandates that a portion of the State’s allocable budget be earmarked for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in proportion to their population. This, the Minister said, helps in the upliftment of the Dalits as envisaged by Ambedkar and Jagjivan Ram.\nPaying tributes to Jagjivan Ram and his contribution in various capacities, Mr. Muniyappa said that the former stood for social equality and equal rights for the oppressed classes. The contribution of Jagjivan Ram as the Minister for Food and Agriculture, and the policies initiated by him which culminated in the Green Revolution, was also highlighted by him.\nOn the prevailing situation with respect to the oppressed communities, the Minister said that although Dalit students receive reservation in schools and colleges, they continue to face social exploitation or discrimination.\nIn universities and academic institutions, Dalit scholars struggle to receive equal recognition, while caste-based violence, atrocities, and land rights violations against Dalits still persist in some regions, he added.\nThe Minister described Babu Jagjivan Ram as the model for a society which prioritised the development of all communities, especially the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and it was in the fitness of things that the Government of Karnataka has established Babu Jagjivan Ram study centres in nine universities across the State, including the KSOU in Mysuru.\nThrough these centres, seminars, conferences, and other programmes are being organised to create social, educational, and economic awareness among the marginalised communities.\nMinister for Social Welfare H.C. Mahadevappa inaugurated the seminar, and KSOU Vice-Chancellor Sharanappa V. Halse, Registrar Naveen Kumar, Director of Babu Jagjivan Ram Research Centre Sharanamma, and others, were present."

    "content": "The State government will support the State-run transport undertakings to slowly increase the proportion of electric buses, Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said in Belagavi on Friday.\n“Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation has already introduced a large fleet of electric buses in Bengaluru. Other STUs will be introducing electric vehicles in phases. . Electric buses will be provided in all districts. Kalayn Karnataka Road Transport Corporation will soon introduced 300 buses in Belagavi, which will include 100 electric buses,’‘ he said. He was speaking at the inauguration of the new office of the joint commissioner of transport and Regional Transport Office near Triveni circle in Belagavi.  The office complex has been built at a cost of  ₹10 crore.\nThe Department of Transport is one of the revenue generating departments in the government. But its functioning was affected due to long standing vacancies in the department. The State government has begun the process of filling vacancies in Transport Department. Once it is completed, there will be perceptible changes, he said.\nHe appealed to officers and staff to reduce the middle men menace in the department offices. The officers and staff of the office should work towards providing quick and efficient services to the public, he said. He urged officials to deal strictly with traffic violations like loud horns and bright lights.\nPublic Works and District in charge Minister Satish Jarkiholi thanked Mr. Reddy for the new office complex in Belagavi and other works. “The construction of the Belagavi city bus stand, taken up under the Smart City scheme is nearly complete. It will be inaugurated soon. The Central and State governments have shared the cost of the project equally. The automated driving path was constructed in Bailhongal at the cost of ₹5 crore. It will help train KKRTC drivers in large numbers,” he said. He demanded 500 buses for the Belagavi district and construction of more bus stands in rural areas. He said PWD would work with the Transport Department in this.\nSatish Jarkiholi gave some suggestions to revitalise the Transport Department. “The department should provide advice and instructions to the public, as well as provide necessary training to vehicle drivers. Stricter rules should be implemented for issuing vehicle driving licenses and licenses should be issued. This could greatly reduce the number of accidents,” he said.\nHe said officers should identify old vehicles and ask the owners to renew their documents. Tractor users who cause inconvenience by using loud horns and by not using tail lamps, should be fined, Satish Jarkiholi said.\nWomen and Child Development Minister Lakshmi Hebbalkar said that Belagavi district was among the biggest in the State and needed more buses. She said that she frequently got complaints about agents harassing common people in Transport Department offices. She urged officers to extend courtesy and prompt service.\nShe opposed criticism by the opposition against the State government that there were no development works being taken up. “Our government has not lagged behind in development. It is taking up several development projects along with guarantee schemes,” she said.\n“There is not a single example of the BJP governments in the past bringing schemes for the poor. Our opponents do not want to deliver guarantee schemes to the people, they have never done anything good for the people. They are only busy criticising our schemes. But now that our guarantee schemes have succeeded, they are copying them and using them as poll promises in Bihar and other States, she said.\nMLAs Asif Seth and Mahantesh Kaujalagi, Transport and Road Safety Commissioner Yogish A.M,  Police Commissioner Borase Bhushan Gulabarao, Joint Commissioner of Transport S. Omkareshwari, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Rahul Shinde, Additional Commissioner Halaswamy,  Regional Transport Officer Nagesh Mundase, other officers like B.P.

    "content": "Ancient carved memorial stones, also known as menhirs, found at a village in eastMizoram‘s Champhai district, have been officially declared a ‘monument of national importance’ by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), officials said on Friday (July 18, 2025).\nLianpui village near the Myanmar border is home to the memorial stones, locally known as Lungphun Ropui. The village is situated 54 km southeast of Champhai town near the India-Myanmar border, and it is famous for its rich repository of ancient artefacts.\nThis is the second megalith site in Mizoram to receive national recognition after ‘Kawtchhuah Ropui’ or Great Entranceway in Vangchhia village, which hosts over 170 engraved menhirs and is located about 20 km south of Lianpui village, they said.\nThe formal notification declaring the Lianpui menhirs as a monument of national importance was issued by the Ministry of Culture on July 14, following years of research and inspection, they said.\nThese antiquarian artefacts include 114 intricately carved memorial stones, anthropic holes, petroglyphs, Y-shaped wooden posts and ancient pathways.\nAlso read:Decoding Vangchhia’s ancient art of holding water in rock amid Mizoram’s hills\nThe upright memorial stones at Lianpui bear detailed carvings of human figures, birds, animals, mithun heads, gongs, lizards, and other cultural motifs reflecting the cultural practices of the Mizos before the advent of Christianity, according to officials.\nThe largest of such memorial stones measures 1.87 metres in height and 1.37 metres in width, they said.\nThese menhirs are arranged into eight alignments, with four oriented north-south and the other four east-west, they said. Lianpui village was named after Lusei chief Lianpuia, who reportedly established the village in the 18th century CE.\nMizoram’s lone Rajya Sabha member, K. Vanlalvena, had informed the Parliament in March that the ASI, after a thorough inspection by experts, had found Lianpui village to possess significant archaeological heritage worthy of national importance.\nAccording to officials, the process of declaring the site of national importance began in February 2021 with the publication of a preliminary notification in the Gazette of India, marking the commencement of a statutory procedure required under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, for declaring protected monuments.\nOn July 7 this year, ASI Director (Monuments) A.M.V. Subramanyam visited Lianpui village and confirmed that final steps were underway to declare the megalith site of national importance.\nWith no objections filed, the Centre finalised the notification declaring Lungphun Ropui a monument of national importance and brought the site under national protection.\nMeanwhile, residents of Lianpui village expressed happiness and thanked the Art and Culture minister C Lalsawivunga and K. Vanlalvena for their efforts towards receiving the ASI’s tag.\nArt and culture department director Carol VLMS Dawngkimi also expressed happiness due to the national recognition and dedicated the achievement to the hard work of many individuals, particularly former convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) Mizoram chapter P.

Chandrababu Naidu on Friday declared that Amaravati, the capital city of the State, will be developed as a Green Hydrogen Valley, positioning it at the forefront of India’s clean energy revolution.\nSpeaking at the Green Hydrogen Summit-2025 held at SRM University, located at the foothill of Neerukonda, a small hill in Amaravati, the Chief Minister called upon researchers and investors to focus on low-cost green hydrogen production and assured necessary infrastructure support from the government.\nMr. Naidu emphasised the urgency to shift from traditional fossil fuels to carbon-free energy sources like green hydrogen, highlighting its potential to reduce costs and benefit the common man. He noted that green hydrogen would be a game-changer for the energy sector, supporting India’s net-zero carbon target by 2070.\nTwo major investment deals worth ₹51,000 crore were signed at the summit in Mr. Naidu’s presence. UK-based Yamna Company, which focused on developing and investing in green hydrogen and green ammonia projects, will invest ₹16,000 crore to establish a one-million-tonne capacity green hydrogen plant in Krishnapatnam, Nellore district. Similarly, KSH Infra will invest ₹35,000 crore to set up plants in Machilipatnam with a capacity of 150 kilotonnes of green hydrogen and 600 kilo tonnes of green ammonia per year.\nThe Chief Minister stated that Andhra Pradesh is already advancing in this direction, with NTPC setting up a green hydrogen plant in Visakhapatnam and green ammonia production soon to begin in Kakinada. The State has set a target of producing 160 MW of green hydrogen and is developing electrolyser capacity of 3 GW alongside solar, wind, and pumped hydro energy.\nMr. Naidu announced that a Quantum Valley powered by artificial intelligence will be established in Amaravati and that the Amaravati Green Hydrogen Declaration will be released after the two-day summit being held at SRM University. A review of its implementation will be held after one year, he added.\nThe university Pro-Chancellor Dr. P.

They can evaluate papers either by sitting at home, logging in at colleges, or at the designated centres for evaluation. The university has introduced this system for the first time, with the objective of speeding up the evaluation process.\nThe university uploads scanned answer scripts to a software. The evaluators can access these scripts with the login facility. “The entire process of evaluation can be done online. The evaluators read the scripts and award marks accordingly. Once the evaluators complete their job, the same papers are assigned to the reviewer. There is no need for another person to enter the score. With this, the declaration of results will be much easier,” S.M. Gopinath, Registrar (Evaluation), toldThe Hindu.\nDegree college teachers have been provided with laptops under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA). The university is not providing the teachers with systems for evaluation.\nThe evaluation process began on July 12, and in the last six days, the results of the final semester (sixth) have been announced. “We have been able to declare results of the final semester so soon because of the intorduction of the new system. Every day, nearly 450 teachers, including the guest faculties, log in and evaluate over 1.25 lakh papers. As they need not travel and can access the papers from wherever they are, the work is moving at a fast pace,” the Registrar said. There are over 60,000 students in undergraduate courses, spread over two districts. They write six papers in each semester.\nEarlier, teachers were asked to gather at the university office located in Shivamogga and review the hard copies of the answer scripts. After awarding the score, the teachers had to enter the score in a system, and that took a long time. The process took a significant change earlier this year, during the evaluation of papers of the odd semesters, when the university decided to scan the answer scripts and introduced paperless evaluation. Consequently, instead of one centre, the evaluation was conducted at five centres in two districts – Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru, under the jurisdiction of the university.\n“This time, we have moved one step ahead. The centres are also active. The teachers in colleges near the centres can visit the centres after the college hours and evaluate papers. Others can log in during free hours in the college or at home. There is no room for malpractice, as there are enough security measures and monitoring tools in place,” the officer stated.\nThe university has plans to improve the process further by scanning the answer scripts immediately after the exams are over. “In the future, we will scan the papers right after the exam and upload them. The university will assign them to evaluators. Within a few minutes after the exams are over, the evaluators can start evaluation. Our aim is to declare results within hours after the exams are over,” he added.\nThe teaching staff working in rural colleges, particularly those located in places known for heavy rains, are finding it difficult to evaluate papers online due to network issues. “In my college, I don’t get internet. I am going to the evaluation centre after the college hours to clear the papers allotted to me,” said a teacher, who wished not to be named."

Chandrababu Naidu, who promised to build “Swarna Andhra Pradesh,” had instead turned it into “Madhyandhra Pradesh” due to the unchecked liquor trade. She said the free sand policy had turned into a farce, with the poor unable to access it while mafias reaped profits.\nMs. Vanaja criticised the steep hike in power tariffs and the reversal of the Telugu Desam Party’s (TDP) stand on smart meters. She recalled that HRD Minister Nara Lokesh had opposed smart meters while in the Opposition, but now supports their installation.\nAnnouncing a mass protest on August 5 at electricity offices across the State, Ms. Vanaja said the CPI would demand a rollback of smart meters and recent power sector policies. The party would intensify its agitation if the government fails to respond, she warned.\nShe also mentioned that the CPI national conference in Chandigarh will deliberate on the Union government’s “destructive policies,” while the State conference, scheduled for August 23–25 in Ongole, will feature 2,000 Red Shirt volunteers and 1,000 women in red sarees.\nCPI Eluru District Secretary Mannava Krishna Chaitanya, State Executive Member Dega Prabhakar, and others also spoke at the event.

A detailed complaint had already been submitted to the National Highways Authority of India, he added.\nMeanwhile, Kodikkunnil Suresh, MP, has criticised Mr. Cherian’s stance against the “widening of the Kollam-Theni National Highway 183 into a four-lane road.” In a statement issued on Friday, Mr. Suresh said that it was due to his intervention that a decision was made to widen the existing road, which requires minimal land acquisition. “This decision has the full support of both the Central and State governments. The statements made by Minister Saji Cherian are intended solely to create confusion among the public,” Mr. Suresh said.\nThe Mavelikara MP said the decision to widen the road was taken after conducting various studies. “Widening the road is the most suitable option for the national highway development. Accordingly, the alignment was approved, the 3A Gazette Notification for land acquisition was published, and the project cost is currently under consideration by the Finance Committee,” he said.\nMr. Suresh said that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the State government held a favourable stance on the Kollam-Theni National Highway development. Mr. Cherian has taken a different position, possibly due to vested interests, he alleged."

Crime has gone out of control, and it seems that the mafia, and not the government, is running the State. Haryana, which was known for prosperity and greenery during the Congress tenure, is now known for hooliganism and bullets,” he said in a statement.\nHitting out at the BJP, the Congress leader said, “Before 2005, Haryana faced similar law and order challenges, but when the Congress government assumed power in 2005, it issued a stern warning to criminals to either abandon crime or leave the State. We didn’t just make promises, we acted on them. The Congress government successfully eradicated gangsters, mafia, and miscreants from Haryana,” he said.\n“As a result, for a decade, law and order were maintained, creating a secure environment that attracted significant business investments. This made Haryana the top State in India for job creation, investment, and development. However, since the BJP took power, law and order have deteriorated, causing businessmen to leave the State one by one and deterring new investments,” he added.\n“The poor law and order situation in the State is worrisome, for which the BJP government is to be blamed. The rise in crime is a clear testament to the fact that the BJP government has failed to provide security to the public,” he said."

Krishnaiah. Addressing the students, Mr. Krishnaiah lambasted the government for its ‘negligence’ in releasing the funds crucial for the education of SC, ST, and BC students.\nHe pointed out that education is a constitutional right, and scholarships and fee reimbursements are essential for ensuring that marginalised communities progress.\nHe said that the fee reimbursement scheme, introduced by the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government, which helped educate a lot of children from marginalised communities, was now being neglected.\n“This scheme has brought a qualitative change in society. It curbed child labour and encouraged higher education. Why is this progress now being obstructed?” he asked. “How is it that the government that borrows lakhs of crores for various schemes, cannot release ₹6,000 crore for shaping the future of students?”\nStudents explained that colleges were withholding certificates due to unpaid arrears. Those who secured jobs are being forced to clear these arrears through personal loans to retrieve their certificates. Colleges, too, are struggling, unable to pay rent for premises or salaries to lecturers, leaving faculty members in financial distress."

Mr. Mishra directed the Deputy Director of the Social Welfare Department to issue notices to departments that have failed to use the funds effectively and to initiate disciplinary action under provisions of the SCSP/TSP Act.\n“Priority should be given to beneficiary-oriented schemes.

In response, officials said there was a lack of interest among the community in the schemes offered.\n“If beneficiaries are not showing interest, the department must officially communicate this to the State headquarters and the district nodal officer,” Mr. Mishra said, adding that department heads are directly accountable for spending the allocated Budget.\nThe meeting was attended by Social Welfare Department Deputy Director Chidanandappa, Backward Classes Welfare Officer Raju, Food and Civil Supplies Deputy Director Sakeena, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Yalla Ramesh Babu, Urban Development Project Officer Raghavendra, and other district-level officials."

Officials seized 3.25 kg of the contraband, two vehicles and four mobile phones from their possession during a raid in Bowenpally.\nThe accused were identified as Savlaram Bishnoi, 43, Hapuram Bishnoi, 38, and Lalaram Bishnoi, 41, all natives of the Jalore district in Rajasthan.\n“The prime accused, Savlaram, has reportedly been running the racket with his brother for over a decade, targeting members of the Rajasthani community settled in Hyderabad by pushing false claims that opium boosts strength, vitality, and sexual health,” explained an officer from EAGLE.\nAccording to him, a tip-off received over 45 days ago led to an intensive technical surveillance effort, which eventually tracked a consignment leaving Bhinmal in Rajasthan in an SUV. Officials later identified another SUV being used as a pilot vehicle. On July 18, both vehicles were intercepted in Bowenpally, where the accused were waiting to deliver the drugs to local customers.\n“Opium abuse has led many into addiction, poor health, and financial ruin. This gang exploits migrants from their home region with pseudo-medicinal claims to sell addictive substances,” explained the officer.\nThe investigation revealed that Savlaram had previously worked as a welder in Hyderabad and began drug peddling when his agricultural income proved insufficient. His brother Gangaram was arrested in 2019 by the Bowenpally police in a similar case. Since then, he has been helping Savlaram operate from Rajasthan. Hapuram, a relative, had joined the operation recently after being promised a commission. Lalaram, who runs a welding shop in Adilabad, has been helping in storage and logistics.\nEAGLE said the gang earned up to ₹4 lakh per kg of opium sold. The seized consignment, worth around ₹17 lakh, had been handed over to the authorities for further action."

    "content": "The closure of Rythu Bazaar at the Old Maharaja Hospital in Vizianagaram appears imminent, as officials have confirmed that the land belongs to the Pusapati family, which won the case in connection with the property in court.\nAccording to sources, the family members of the Vizianagaram royal family have appealed to the government to remove the property from the 22-A prohibitory list, pointing out that they have won the case in the court and that relevant documents in have been submitted to get back the piece of land located near the MRO office.\nVizianagaram Collector B.R. Ambedkar toldThe Hinduthat the Pusapati family approached the government five years ago over the property issue and that it has now submitted the details of the court order.\n“Rythu Bazaar was unofficially set up as the revenue officials permitted the farmers to sell their produce after the hospital was shifted to the new premises. We will try to accommodate 30 farmers in the remaining three Rythu Bazaars in the city to protect their livelihood,” the Collector said.\nA source in the Pusapati family said that the family of P.V.G. Raju, the last Maharaja of Vizianagaram, had donated land worth crores of rupees for the construction of schools, colleges and hospitals. “It is unfair to question the royal family when the court has given a favourable order to take back the land. We could not take it back all these years since it was kept in the 22-A list,” he said.\nMeanwhile, farmers and citizens staged a demonstration, demanding that the government allow the Rhythu Bazaar to continue in the same place.\nVizianagaram Pattana Powra Samskshema Sangham president Reddi Shankara Rao claimed that the land belonged to the government as per the 1968 revenue records. “Each farmer has been paying a rent of around ₹3,800 per month to the Marketing Department since 1999. Around ₹15 lakh has been collected by the government from each farmer in the last 26 years. It is absolutely unfair to ask the farmers to vacate the land, without issuing individual notices. The decision will cause inconvenience to more than 1,000 consumers,” he said.\nKumili G. Lakshmi, a farmer, said that the government must come to their rescue. Echoing the same view, Kondamama, another farmer, said that the government should construct a new Rythu Bazaar before asking them to vacate the land. A. Venkateswara Rao, a citizen, urged the government officials and the Pusapati family to rethink the decision to resume the land, saying that the Rhythu Bazaar has been catering to the needs of thousands of citizens and hundreds of farmers.\n“The closure of the Rythu Bazaar will affect the farmers and the people as well. Vizianagaram has a population of around 16 lakh, and more Rythu Bazaars are needed. Moreover, closure of the Rythu Bazaar would damage the reputation of the Pusapati family,” said S. Sankara Rao, a consumer."

    "content": "Two senior citizens from Hyderabad were defrauded of over ₹1.18 crore in separate cybercrimes that relied on forged government documents, fake trading apps, and psychological manipulation.\nIn the first case, a 64-year-old man from Yousufguda lost ₹86.41 lakhs after being lured into investing through two fake trading apps falsely claiming to operate under SEBI approval. He was approached via WhatsApp with offers of daily trading profits in institutional stocks, OTC trades, and IPOs under the QIB quota. Through one of the platforms, he deposited ₹71.75 lakhs and was shown a notional profit of ₹4.78 crores. When he attempted to withdraw ₹2.5 crores, he was asked to first pay a 20% profit share, which he could not deduct from the app balance.\nSimilarly, on the second platform, he invested ₹14.66 lakhs on which he earned a ‘profit’ of ₹5.56 lakhs. However, access was blocked when he refused to pay upfront charges including a 30% profit share. To intensify the pressure, the fraudsters even sent a fake Enforcement Directorate (ED) notice accusing him of money laundering.\nIn a separate incident, an 83-year-old retired government employee from Lalaguda was conned out of ₹32.2 lakhs through a fake arrest warrant scam on June 23, 2025. He received a threatening phone call alleging an arrest warrant had been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. A forged ED document bearing his Aadhaar number and counterfeit seals were used. Impersonators posing as ED and police officials warned of immediate arrest and deportation to Mumbai, pushing the victim into panic.\nThe scammers coerced him into making multiple payments to close the case, later demanding additional sums as ‘loyalty payments’ to officials who allegedly helped him. They falsely promised a government refund with compensation and continued communication even after payments stopped, maintaining the illusion of an ongoing legal issue.\nBoth the cases are under investigation."

    "content": "From setting up climate monitoring hubs to turning water hyacinths stalks into value-added products, students took the  floor with purpose at the Panchayat Climate Mock Parliament (PCP) held recently at Christ College, Irinjalakuda, under the joint leadership of the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) and the Bring Back Green Foundation.\nMore than 300 school and college students, acting as youth parliamentarians, introduced a series of bold, actionable proposals rooted in hyperlocal climate data. The standout Bills included a climate monitoring and awareness centre in Muriyad panchayat to support its agrarian economy; a CCTV surveillance network in Irinjalakuda municipality to curb illegal waste dumping; stream and canal rejuvenation projects in Padiyoor and Poomangalam to strengthen flood resilience; and an initiative to manufacture value-added products from water hyacinths  and other natural resources, tapping into local biodiversity for economic sustainability.\nThe mock parliament, modelled on real legislative procedures, saw spirited debates between ruling  and opposition benches. Student ministers defended their Bills while their peers challenged the feasibility and inclusivity of each, replicating authentic democratic functioning.\nThe proposals were not theoretical. They stemmed from an year-long grassroots survey and campaign in the Irinjalakuda constituency, where student volunteers from Christ College and St. Joseph’s College engaged with communities across Muriyad, Padiyoor, Poomangalam, and Irinjalakuda municipality. Their work included climate vulnerability assessments, data collection, and community dialogue , all of which informed the legislative agenda.\nThe initiative was inaugurated by Minister for Higher Education R. Bindu, who praised the programme for transforming classrooms into real-world civic labs. “The Panchayat Climate Mock Parliament offers a rare opportunity for students to translate knowledge into governance, activism, and climate leadership,” she said.\nThis event marked more than a symbolic exercise. The final reports and Bills were formally submitted to the respective local self-government institutions (LSGIs), paving the way for possible real-world adoption.\nSpearheaded by KILA and Bring Back Green with the support of the State government and the LSG department, the Panchayat Climate Mock Parliament is a decentralised, youth-led model for participatory climate governance. It bridges the gap between global climate discourse and local action, enabling students to assess vulnerabilities, co-create solutions, and collaborate with elected representatives.\nNow, buoyed by the success of the Irinjalakuda pilot, the programme aims to expand to more climate-vulnerable places  across Kerala, using hazard, vulnerability, and risk (HVR) assessments to guide interventions."

Ramakrishnan and U. Ullas.\nA Bench of Justice Kauser Edappagath quashed the case following a petition filed by the two dancers. Ms. Satyabhama had alleged that Mr. Ramakrishnan recorded a phone conversation he had with her, and edited and published it in a different media.\nThe dancers edited and posted it on social media platforms, an act punishable under Sections 500 (punishment for defamation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, she contended.\nRefuting this, the dancers contended that they cannot be prosecuted since the alleged defamatory statements had not been reproduced in the complaint, nor did the petitioners produce a copy of the publication that contained the alleged defamatory statements. Ms. Satyabhama’s counsel said the publication could be produced during trial.\nThe issue pertained to a dance contest hosted in Abu Dhabi by a Malayali association, where Ms. Satyabhama was a judge. Contestants whom Mr. Ramakrishnan had trained did not win any prize, after which he telephoned her and questioned her on the propriety of her decision.\nShe reportedly told him that many of the ‘mudras’ of the contestants were wrong and that even experienced dance teachers committed mistakes. She approached the court, stating that the duo recorded the conversation and posted it on social media, portraying it as a statement against her dance ‘gurus’.\nSince the complainant had failed to produce the alleged defamatory publication, the offence under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be attracted against the petitioners. Taking these into account, the court quashed further proceedings in the case."

Initially, the State was looking for a normal or below normal rainfall in July this time, as per the long-range forecast issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nHowever, the westerly stream from the Arabian Sea along the coast of Kerala is picking up strength in the second half of July and meeting head-on with the coastline of the State. Though the models were not capturing the weather scenario properly in the last few days, the monsoon is expected to intensify across the State during the next two days, and it will be further enhanced during the remaining part of the month after a brief pause, as per the extended forecast of the IMD.\nAt present, the State has received a total of 910.7 mm of rainfall so far against the average of 1,043.8 mm of rain during the period from June 1 to July 18, a shortfall of 13%, which is considered normal as a deviation within the range of plus or minus 19% is considered normal by the IMD. From July 10 to 16, the southwest monsoon was 35% deficient in Kerala and 28% in the previous week.\nHowever, a fresh low-pressure area over northern Bay of Bengal is likely to form around July 24 or 25 with a low probability of its intensification into a depression. The system is expected to strengthen and may move inland, which would enhance the monsoon wind flow along the core region of the west coast.\nThe IMD has issued a red alert for five districts from Malappuram to Kasaragod on Saturday, warning of extreme heavy rains, and an orange alert for Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, and Palakkad, indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall. The rest of Kerala is put on yellow alert, where isolated heavy rain is likely on Saturday.\n“On Sunday as well, heavy rain is expected across the State, and the enhanced rainfall activity in Kerala, including the anticipated heavy rainfall in the last week of July, may bridge the rainfall deficiency in the State, perhaps clocking normal or above normal rainfall in July, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Last year, only July saw the normal rainfall with 16 percent excess rainfall, while the monsoon was deficient in the other three months during the four-month southwest monsoon season in Kerala."

Youth Congress members must remember this aspect of history. The political outfit of the RSS was Jan Sangh, later renamed as the BJP. These people talk aggressively about patriotism, but stayed away from the freedom struggle. They never stood for the nation,” he added.\nThe Chief Minsiter referred to the speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the concept of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. “But the reality is that the BJP has never tried to take Indian society forward together. The party has 240 Members of Parliament but not a single one is from the minority communities. They never respect B.R. Ambedkar, nor honour the Constitution he gave us,” Mr. Siddaramaiah added.\nHe said that Congress was the only party truly committed to the spirit and values of the Constitution, and urged the Youth Congress members to highlight the role of Savarkar in the defeat of Ambedkar in the 1952 elections."

    "content": "The Water Resources Organisation (WRO) has been accused of destroying a key part of the wetland surrounding the Ooty lake by dumping silt from the lakebed.\nConservationists who visited the site said the entire wetland complex surrounding the lake is at risk of complete devastation. “It was only last year that the Salem division of Southern Railways destroyed another portion of a wetland surrounding the lake by constructing a parking facility. Now it seems to be the turn of the WRO,” said G. Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association. He said that the government continued to have little regard for protecting wetlands, with major projects, including adventure park facilities already being constructed around the Ooty lake.\nThe WRO is currently conducting a clean-up and desilting of the Ooty Lake, with conservationists stating that the wing, operating under the Public Works Department (PWD) was causing irreversible damage to the wetland ecosystem, home to multiple species of birds and small mammals as well as unique wetland flora.\nN. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist, said that plans to expand the bus stand adjoining the wetland were thwarted a few years ago, citing potential impacts to biodiversity and also due to increase of flooding risk within the town. Mr. Mohanraj said that the wetland acts as a sponge during spells of heavy rain, absorbing excess water from the Ooty lake that would otherwise flood low-lying areas of the town.\n“The wetland acts as a swamp-cum-reservoir that reduces flooding. Dumping silt from the lake will fundamentally change it for the worse and reduce its ability to absorb water during rain,” he said, adding that the slurry should be dumped elsewhere where it does not impact biodiversity and fragile ecosystems.\nWhen contacted, sources in the Fisheries Department said that they were not given any prior notice of the dumping of waste from the Ooty lake. “Due to the dumping by the WRO, our farms have become non-operational. We have raised our objections with the district administration which promised to take action,” said an official who requested anonymity.\nConservationists said that damage done to the wetland would take years to reverse. The WRO’s unscientific approach towards desilting the Ooty lake was destroying biodiversity both within the lake as well as wetlands around its perimeter.\nWhen contacted, Ddistrict Collector Lakshmi Bhavya Tanneeru said that was no permission was granted to the WRO to dump silt in the wetland. She said that the WRO had ceased dumping the silt in May of this year, and that she had sought an explanation from the department for the same. “They have also assured us that once the rain stops and the soil dries, they would remove the silt and transport it to Theetukkal (dump yard),“ said the Collector."

    "content": "The story so far:Actor C. Joseph Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has been facing multiple civil cases since itlaunched its party flag. While a representative of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) approached the City Civil Court in Chennai, objecting to the depiction of two trumpeting elephants in TVK’s flag, a trust titled Thondai Mandala Saandror Dharma Paribalana Sabaifiled a civil suit in the Madras High Courtalleging a “deceptively”similar colour schemehaving been used in the flag. The first Assistant City Civil Court in Chennai on July 11, 2025 dismissed an application filed on behalf of BSP to grant an interim injunction restraining Mr. Vijay from using the two elephants in his party flag. The court also refused to grant the liberty to file a fresh application for an interim injunction against TVK’s flag.\nIt was Periyaranban alias R. Elangovan, the Tamil Nadu general secretary of BSP, who had filed an original suit in the city civil court against TVK president Mr. Vijay and general secretary Bussy Anand alias N. Anand early this year. According to the plaintiff, BSP was a national party which had been allotted an ‘elephant’ as its reserved election symbol across the country, but for Assam, by the Election Commission of India (ECI). Further, the BSP’s flag too had a picture of an elephant. In such circumstances, the party was shocked to find two elephants in TVK’s flag introduced on August 22, 2024. Though a complaint was lodged in this regard with the ECI, the latter replied that it could not interfere with the disputes related to party flags. Hence, the plaintiff had chosen to file the suit along with the application for interim injunction.\nThe applicant claimed that the voters generally identify the symbol of elephant with the BSP and that they were bound to get confused if TVK also uses the pictures of elephants in its flag. “The BSP will be the ultimate sufferer. The loyal voter base of the BSP will be sabotaged due to a visually-similar symbol in the eyes of the public. The confusion over symbols has far reaching ramifications affecting the fundamental principles of democratic polity. Permitting the newly-formed TVK to use the symbol of elephant in TVK party flag would amount to diluting BSP’s identity and confusing the electorate,” the application read.\nTVK’s general secretary Mr. Anand filed a detailed counter affidavit to the interim injunction petition through his counsel K. Gowtham Kumar and the counter was adopted by Mr. Vijay. Categorically denying all assertions made by the applicant as untenable, the TVK office-bearers contended their flag had been meticulously designed to reflect the party’s core values, ideological foundation and its vision for the future of Tamil Nadu.\nUnlike a single white colour standing elephant on the blue colour flag of BSP, TVK’s flag had two trumpeting battle elephants flanking a Vaagai flower (Albizia lebbeck). The depiction of the two pachyderms had been inspired by the majestic twin war elephants of historic Tamil armies. “Elephants have long symbolised immense strength, discipline and strategic powers. These figures evoke the commanding presence of Kumki elephants, representing leadership capable of channelling even the fiercest energies towards constructive and victorious outcomes. Remarkably, records from the Chola era state that their armies fielded over 60,000 elephants. Renowned Scholar Thomas R. Trautmann, in his historical study ‘Elephants and Kings,’ notes that the development of war elephants was a characteristic feature of the South Indian military tradition. Classical Tamil literature also celebrates these noble creatures using poetic expressions such as Muransevi Yaanai (elephants with fanlike ears) underscoring their grandeur, distinctiveness and revered place in the Tamil culture,” the two top office-bearers of TVK said.\nThey said, the two elephants in the TVK flag had no relation to BSP’s election symbol and denied the assertion of any kind of confusion being caused among the electorate.\nWhen the interim injunction application was listed for hearing before the city civil court on July 11, 2025, the applicant’s counsel made an endorsement to withdraw the application by stating that a new cause of action had arisen because of another party too using the elephant symbol in its flag. He said that former BSP State president K. Armstrong’s wife Porkodi Armstrong had started a political party named Tamil Maanila Bahujan Samaj Party (TMBSP) and that its flag too had an elephant similar to the one found in BSP’s flag. Therefore, he sought to withdraw the present interim injunction application and sought the leave of the court to file a fresh application against both TVK as well as TMBSP.\nSenior counsel Vijay Narayan, representing Mr. Vijay, objected to the plea for grant of liberty to file a fresh interim injunction application against TVK. He said, courts could grant liberty only to file a fresh suit under Order 23 Rule 1(3) of Civil Procedure Code and that no such liberty could be granted for filing fresh applications. Pursuant to the arguments advanced by the senior counsel, the applicant’s counsel made an endorsement that he would not pursue the present application for interim injunction.\n“On the basis of the endorsement made by the learned petitioner’s counsel, this petition is dismissed as not pressed against the respondents. Further, TVK and TMBSP are separate parties and founders of each of the parties also separate persons. If the petitioner would like to take legal action against the TMBSP founders, he could very well file a separate suit as against them. The request by the petitioner’s counsel regarding liberty to file fresh application as against these respondents (Mr. Vijay and Mr. Anand), along with others, is not sustainable and rejected because the main suit is pending for the same cause of action,” the civil court judge P. Chandrasekar concluded."

Two students of Union Christian College, Aluva, tested positive for H1N1 influenza as of Friday (July 18). The college authorities said necessary control measures had been initiated on the instructions of the Health authorities.\nA total of 194 influenza cases were reported in the district between July 1 and July 17. On July 8, as many as 31 cases were recorded. A 12-year-old girl from Ayyapmpuzha had succumbed to fever on July 8, though the authorities are yet to confirm the exact reason for the death. On July 15, 32 influenza cases were reported in Ernakulam. The common strains of the influenza virus seen included H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B.\nDr. Rajeev Jayadevan, convenor of the research cell of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kerala, said that influenza is caused by several viruses, which circulate seasonally.\n“In Kerala, the monsoon season brings two factors together. First, people crowd indoors and also travel in vehicles with windows closed due to rain. This allows respiratory viruses to spread easily. Secondly, the humid weather allows the virus to stay alive longer in the air, that is, without the tiny cough droplets drying out,” he said.\nHe added that wearing masks in crowded indoor spaces and avoiding social visits at hospitals are two easy ways to reduce risk. “The flu vaccine protects from severe disease. In addition, unlike COVID-19, there are effective antiviral agents available which reduce the severity of the disease if the diagnosis is made early,” he said.\nSome of the main symptoms include cough, tiredness, fever, runny nose, body aches, sore throat, breathlessness, and wheezing. Doctors usually advise patients to stay hydrated and to cover their mouths while coughing and sneezing. However, elderly persons with co-morbidities must take extra care."

They performed special puja to the river before officially releasing the water into the SRBC.\nAddressing a public gathering, Mr. Janardhan Reddy observed that heavy rains upstream brought healthy inflows into the Krishna, terming it “positive development for the Rayalaseema region.”\nHighlighting the efforts of the NDA government in developing irrigation infrastructure, Mr. Janardhan Reddy said several key projects conceptualised during the earlier TDP term and the present regime were being executed. The government started delivering the promises to the drought-hit Rayalaseema region, he added. “We are also committed to providing the Krishna waters to the Chittoor and Kadapa districts, covering even the last acre,” he said.\nReferring to the Gorukalva project, he said it remained a mere dream under the previous government, but became a reality during 2014–19 when the TDP was in power, which allocated ₹300 crore for its completion. “This project’s storage capacity is being enhanced from 6 tmc ft to 12 tmc ft, leading to an extensive distribution network,” the Minister said.\nEnvisaging plans to route the Krishna waters from Gorukalva through the Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanti (GNSS) network, the Minister said it would supply water to the regions such as Owk in Nandyal and Pulivendula in Kadapa districts.\n“Repairs at ₹2.35 crore have been undertaken on the Gorukalva reservoir. Another ₹22 crore has been sanctioned for canal expansion and maintenance. Instead of contractors, the projects are being handled directly by the government engineers to ensure high quality, transparency and accountability,” he said.\nMr. Jagandhan Reddy criticised the YSRCP government for failing to secure funds for the irrigation projects, particularly in the Rayalaseema region. He urged the officials and Water User Associations to step up awareness among the farmers for prudential use of the water."

    "content": "An interstate drug supplier from West Bengal was arrested in Hyderabad on Friday with 50 grams of amphetamine, a banned stimulant drug. Acting on a tip-off, the Commissioner’s Task Force (East Zone) along with the Chilkalguda police apprehended the suspect near Line Bazar Masjid.\nThe accused, identified as Rajikul Hoque, 21, a native of Subedar Tola village in Malda district, West Bengal, was found in possession of the drug and a mobile phone. The total seizure is estimated to be worth ₹7.6 lakh.\nHoque had earlier worked as a mason in Hyderabad but returned to his hometown due to financial problems. While looking for ways to support his family, he came in contact with one Mojibur Mistri of Mojampur, also in Malda, who is reportedly a known drug dealer and is currently absconding.\nMojibur is said to have convinced Hoque to enter the drug trade, promising high profits. Hoque then procured 50 grams of amphetamine and travelled back to Hyderabad to sell the substance to local users. However, before he could make any deals, he was intercepted by the police team."

Vijayendra on Friday alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would be conducting the ‘Sadhana Samavesha’ in Mysuru on Saturday in order to “threaten” the Congress high command.\nSpeaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said the CM is on the verge of tendering his resignation, and therefore he has planned the convention to “threaten” the party leadership.\n“Whenever there is a threat to his position, Mr. Siddaramaiah remembers the AHINDA communities. When the BJP took out a padayatra over the MUDA scam, he held conventions here and in other places,” Mr. Vijayendra said.\nThe BJP State president accused the Chief Minister of organising the ‘Sadhana Samavesha’ just to save his chair. “He keeps praising AHINDA communities, but today, his mask has fallen. He has failed to deliver justice to them. Mr. Siddaramaiah has no commitment or concern for their development,” he alleged.\nPredicting a significant political development in November, Mr. Vijayendra, while replying to questions on the leadership change in the State, said Congress leaders are themselves saying that there is a “power-sharing agreement” between Mr. Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar in regard to the Chief Minister’s post. Now, the situation has arisen where Mr. Siddaramaiah has to resign, he claimed.\nAlleging that the State administrative machinery has collapsed, he said that the government has achieved nothing over the last two-and-half years, and claimed that the people are frustrated over the administration. “Why are they holding the ‘Samavesha’ when they have achieved nothing?” he asked."

The remaining ₹12.5 crore can be utilised for other department works identified by MLAs in their respective constituencies.\nThe funds would be released from the Chief Minister’s Infrastructure Development Programme (CMIDP), and ₹8,000 crore has been allocated in the State Budget for 2025-26.\nThe release of the grants is expected to ease discontent within the Congress, where some MLAs had publicly criticised the delay. The taking up of development works at the local level is also expected to benefit the party in the civic and local body elections in the State.\nThe decision to release funds came after weeks of internal discussions and mounting pressure from party MLAs who had complained of fund shortage for taking up development works in their constituencies. During the meeting with Mr. Surjewala, the party MLAs expressed disappointment over the lack of financial support. Later, Mr. Surjewala held a meeting with Mr. Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

Every one of these beneficiaries must be made aware of the benefits of crop insurance,” she said. “The premium amount for crop insurance is minimal, but the protection it offers during unforeseen calamities is enormous. It is essential to convince all these farmers to enrol in the scheme by July 31 and achieve 100% coverage.”\nShe added that if officials and bankers fail to carry out the awareness drive and enrolment effectively, strict action would be initiated against them. “Each bank and department must ensure that crop insurance details, particularly the major crops of the district, are disseminated at the taluk and gram panchayat levels, while other crop details should be shared at the hobli level,” she said.\nFor the 2025-26 Kharif season, IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Company Ltd. has been appointed as the implementing insurance agency for the Kalaburagi district under the PMFBY.\nFarmers seeking more information on the scheme can call the helpline number 1800-200-5142 or visit their nearest Raita Samparka Kendra or Assistant Director of Agriculture office.\nMs. Taranum also instructed the Agriculture Department to make full use of media channels to create mass awareness about crop insurance and ensure that farmers understand its benefits and procedures.\nJoint Director of Agriculture, Samad Patel, and senior officials from various banks participated in the meeting."

Revanth Reddy and N. Chandrababu Naidu, together on a common platform to solve their river water issues.\nAddressing a press conference here on Friday, he called out BRS leaders for their criticism and reminded how “KCR himself held a meeting with the then AP CM Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy and talked about utilising 700-800 tmc of ‘surplus’ Godavari water flowing into the sea by AP to provide water to drought prone Rayalaseema region through gravity and two lift schemes.”\n“Former Chief Minister KCR did not bother to involve the Centre in the discussion on water issues then when both CMs had a meeting. Now, there is a visible change in attitude of both Telangana and AP Governments on finding a way to resolve the stalemate. There will be progress only if both governments work together with a clear understanding of contentious issues,” he said.\nThe BJP leader asserted that the Centre was not favouring any particular State and was only interested in finding an amicable and lasting solution, with the formation of a committee of engineers and experts, as agreed by both CMs.\nThe Union Minister also took objection to the Congress Government questioning his contribution to TG and questioned if it has made any plan for utilising the Godavari river water.\nMr. Kishan Reddy added that the ₹521 crore railway manufacturing unit in Kazipet would be making engines, wagons and coaches, and is likely to get another ₹200 crore from the Centre as wagons would likely to be rolled out from next year.\nAbout 70% of the work on the unit has already been completed, and he expects the railway factory would give a fillip to the growth of related ancillary units in the region, generating direct and indirect employment.\nThe Warangal airport would become a reality once the State Government completes land acquisition and pointed out that the earlier KCR Government had failed to seize the initiative when in power despite Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia meeting the CM then.\nMr. Kishan Reddy said the Railways has taken up works worth ₹42,209 crore in Telangana, including upgrading 42 stations of which 37 will be ready by June next year."

The concern towards the environment is on the decline, and natural disasters are more frequent due to the damage.”\nMr. Vijayendra said it is equally important to safeguard the environment along with the advancement of technological developments. ”Sparrows have disappeared and even butterflies are not seen as prominently as they were earlier. Saving trees and planting more trees are the need of the hour to save our nature,” he added.\nMP for Mysuru Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, who spoke on the occasion, complimented the Suttur Math for the seed ball initiative considering the need to plant more trees and protect our environment. “The Math is known for its services in various fields, including education and health, and I am happy to participate in this programme visiting Suttur.”\nMr. Yaduveer also recalled the association between the Math and the Mysuru Palace.\nShivarathri Deshikendra Swamiji of Suttur Math also spoke at the event."

Mr. Kharge turns 83 on July 21.\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah has explicitly said that he will be in the chair for the full five-year term, but has acknowledged that the party high command will decide on the matter. Mr. Kharge, too, has said thatany decision is up to the party high command.\nA couple of months ago, Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar reportedly told the party high command that he should be given the Chief Minister’s post after Mr. Siddaramaiah completes two-and-a-half years in office as per the “power-sharing agreement” between the two during the formation of the government in May 2023.\nIn this ongoing “power struggle” between the Chief Minister and his deputy, some leaders in the party believe there are possibilities of Mr. Kharge returning to State politics and becoming the Chief Minister.\nIn recent days, Mr. Kharge has vetoed some of the decisions taken by Mr. Siddaramaiah and they include the former’s letter to the Chief Minister over reported lapses in the implementation of the roster point system for promotions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees in government departments and rejection of a decade-old Socio-Economic and Educational Survey (caste census), which was the pet project of the Chief Minister. Mr. Kharge also reportedly withheld the names of candidates suggested by the Chief Minister to fill the four vacancies in the Legislative Council.\nMr. Surjewala’s one-to-one meetings with the party MLAs and Ministers have also been seen as a move to gauge the mood of the legislators and the meetings were held reportedly at the behest of Mr. Kharge and Mr. Shivakumar.\nMr. Kharge, who is the second leader from Karnataka to become the AICC chief after S. Nijalingappa, is a staunch loyalist of the Sonia Gandhi family. He has missed the Chief Minister’s post on a couple of occasions in the past. The veteran leader has served in various capacities, including as Union Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha."

    "content": "Bengaluru\nAstronomers at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) have decoded the reasons behind the series of powerful solar eruptions or Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that resulted in rare northern lights dancing across the Ladakh’s night skies in May 2024.\nThese findings offer a major step forward in the improvement of space weather forecasting models, particularly in predicting the impact of complex CME events on Earth’s magnetosphere.\nCMEs are massive ejections of magnetised plasma from the Sun’s corona. When such solar blasts are directed toward the Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids.\nAccording to the Department of Science and Technology, the great geomagnetic storm that started on 10 May, 2024, was linked to a rare sequence of six different CMEs erupting in succession, and it was associated with both solar flares and filament eruptions from an interacting complex active region on the Sun.\nUntil now, gaining a complete understanding of how CMEs evolve thermodynamically as they travel from the Sun to Earth has remained challenging, primarily due to limited observations near the Sun as well as in near-Earth space.\nTo bridge this gap, a team of solar astrophysicists led by Wageesh Mishra, a faculty member at IIA, used observations from the NASA and ESA space missions.\nThey built a model to investigate the manner in which the rare chain of six interacting solar blasts reported from IIA’s Indian Astronomical Observatory at Hanle in Ladakh interacted with each other and evolved thermally en route from the Sun to Earth.\n“The study is the first of its kind, both in India and internationally, to capture the continuous thermodynamic evolution of multiple interacting CMEs across such a vast distance in the heliosphere,” said Dr. Mishra.\n“Our analysis demonstrates that CME-CME interactions lead to significant thermal restructuring within. By the time they reach the Earth, the electrons in the complex ejecta were found to be in the heat-releasing state, while ions displayed a mix of heating and cooling behaviour, with the heating state being the dominant mode overall,” said Soumyaranjan Khuntia, the lead author and a doctoral scholar at IIA."

The projects will be implemented under the Government of India’s Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme, which provides financial support of ₹27 lakh per MWh or up to 30% of the total project cost, whichever is lower.\nExpected to be commissioned within 18 months from signing, the BESS projects will help stabilise the grid by storing power during off-peak hours and discharging it during peak demand. They are also expected to enhance the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are inherently intermittent.\nThe initiative is a significant step in India’s energy transition, introducing a pioneering ‘BESS-as-a-Service’ model where capacity charges are payable for storage services, setting a new benchmark for future storage deployments in the country."

    "content": "Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed the TDP MPs to raise important issues like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various crops, utilisation of the Godavari and Krishna river waters and the support required by Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) for industrial development in the upcoming session of Parliament.\nAddressing the Telugu Desam Parliamentary Party (TDPP) meeting in the run-up to the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21, Mr. Naidu said the MPs should make the best use of the time allotted to them by highlighting the issues related to the State and strive to mobilise the maximum possible amount of funds from the Centre for implementing various schemes and projects.\nHe also wanted the MPs to duly apprise the Parliament of the steps taken by the A.P. Government for the development of the State. The MPs should take the Central support required by the State to the notice of the nation through the Parliament.\nThe CM said, department-wise responsibilities were assigned to the MPs and called upon them to keep in regular touch with the Union Ministers concerned to resolve matters pertaining to the State, and to focus on garnering additional funds under schemes like the Jal Jeevan Mission and Ayushman Bharat.\nMr. Naidu told the MPs to be updated and fully acquainted with the issues dealt by them in order to make forceful arguments on contentious matters, like he articulated the State’s position on certain issues in the recent meeting with the Union Minister for Jal Shakti, C.R. Patil and Telangana CM A. Revanth Reddy.\nHe instructed the MPs to speak about the good work being done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and to actively participate in discussions on topics like Operation Sindoor and the 50th anniversary of the Emergency, and counselled them not to interfere in unnecessary matters in their constituencies as such behaviour would tarnish their personal reputation as well as the party’s.\nUnion Ministers K. Rammohan Naidu and Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and IT Minister and the party’s national general secretary Nara Lokesh were among those present in the deliberations."

The temple was decorated with flowers to mark the event, while religious rites and ceremonies commenced at dawn.\nAs the entry of private vehicles was banned to regulate traffic, KSRTC had introduced shuttle services from the Lalitha Mahal Palace grounds to Chamundi Hills for the devotees. In sync with the tradition, many devotees walked up 1008 steps barefoot leading to the shrine. Among them was Minister of State for MSMEs Shobha Karandlaje, who has been following this tradition for years.\nAs it was the last Friday of Ashada, the district administration had anticipated heavy rush and had made adequate arrangements to enable the public to have a hassle-free darshan at the temple. But the authorities also had to manage the ‘VIPs’, including ministers and political leaders who made a beeline. Minister K.H. Muniyappa, BJP State president B.Y. Vijayendra, and others were among the ones who visited.\nThe serpentine queue winding along the barricades was lengthy since dawn and police personnel were deployed in large numbers to handle any exigency."

    "content": "The Hyderabad Police recorded a 75% drop in reported digital arrest scams in the first half of 2025, with just 34 cases registered between January and June this year in sharp contrast to the 140 reported in the same period last year.\nOfficials credit the decline to persistent campaigns on social media, community outreach, and timely advisories issued by cybercrime units. However, they warn that senior citizens, particularly those living alone and with children abroad, continue to remain the most vulnerable targets.\nIn 2024, the city witnessed a rise in digital arrest scams, with 140 cases in the first half of the year and 214 more in the second half. Most victims were between 60 and 80 years of age, highly educated, and often retired professionals.\nTwo recent cases indicate the depth of the scam. On April 5, this year an 84-year-old man from Secunderabad was conned out of ₹44 lakh after being falsely told his number was linked to money laundering. Three men, identified as Tauqeeb Raza, Rahil Imam and Ali Asad, all from Jharkhand, were arrested, and police recovered mobile phones, cheque books, fake company stamps, SIM cards, and swiping machines.\nIn a second case reported on March 29, a 69-year-old woman from Hyderabad lost ₹38.7 lakh after impersonators claiming to be Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) officials and Mumbai police officers accused her of being involved in money laundering and human trafficking. Arbaz Pasha from Bengaluru was arrested on July 9 and a mobile phone was seized.\nPolice say the goal of such fraud is not just financial gain but total psychological control, isolating victims, monitoring them constantly, and forcing them to act under duress."

He has no concern for the future of the State. His political approach is focused solely on personal gain,” the Minister alleged.\n“He neither give constructive suggestions nor attended Legislative Assembly sessions in the last one year. Instead, he has been threatening political leaders and government officials,” Mr. Parthasarathy said, and questioned the YSRCP leader’s open support to uttering violent movie dialogues by his cadres.\nMr. Parthasarathy also accused Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy of showing no respect for the police or the judiciary. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s statements have been demoralising the police force, especially at a time when they are trying to maintain law and order. Employees who  working diligently and sincerely will be supported and protected by the government,” he said.\nThe YSRCP president should know that public response to the ‘Suparipalanaku Yedadi’ programme had been overwhelmingly positive across the State. “Had welfare schemes not reached the people, they would have revolted long ago,” the Minister said."

They also claimed that the doctors on duty said all ventilators were occupied and could not be made available. She was subsequently moved to a private hospital in the city, but was later shifted to the hospital in Mukkom as the family could not afford treatment at the private facility. The girl died at the hospital in Mukkom on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the MCH authorities are yet to respond to the allegation.

Together, “we can build a resilient, future-focused GCC ecosystem that inspires the world,” the Minister’s office said on Friday in a release.\nDAZN’s decision to set up the sport-tech GCC is a testament to Hyderabad’s growing reputation as a global hub for innovation-led operations. Telangana is one of the fastest-growing destinations for GCCs, with Hyderabad witnessing addition of nearly one new GCC every week.\nDAZN has chosen Hyderabad as a strategic base for its global sports-tech operations. Its Hyderabad GCC is set to become the company’s largest global operations hub, employing approximately 3,000 professionals by 2026.\nWith a ₹500 crore investment over next three years, the company’s new centre marks a significant strategic expansion of DAZN’s footprint in India and Telangana. It will drive development of next-generation sports technology by scaling engineering and product innovation, building advanced AI and real-time analytics platforms, Mr. Sridhar Babu’s office said.\nThe company has been expanding footprint in India since setting up a CoE in Hyderabad in 2023. In just two years, DAZN has scaled to over 1,500 employees, including highly skilled engineers, data scientists and developers and firmly established Hyderabad as one of its key global technology and operations hubs.\nChief Technology Officer Sandeep Tiku said: “Hyderabad has been a perfect destination for DAZN to grow its technology and product operations, thanks to the State government’s progressive policies, world-class infrastructure and highly skilled talent pool.”"

Palaniswami, on Friday termed the present State government a “failed model.”\nAddressing a gathering at Nannilam in Tiruvarur district as part of his State-wideMakkalai Kappom, Thamizhgathai Meetpomroadshow on July 18, Mr. Palaniswami listed the failures of the present government led by M.K. Stalin, particularly on the law and order front.\nCiting the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 10-year-old schoolgirl at Gummidipoondi in Tiruvallur district, Mr. Palaniswami said the safety of women, from girls to elderly women, was under threat as the criminals had no fear.\nDrugs and other intoxicants were freely available in the State, he charged. In an oblique reference to the Chief Minister, he said if anyone wanted others to call him “Appa,” (father),  first he should inherit the qualities of a father.\nHaving a dig at the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister by stating that elevation of his son (Udhayanidhi Stalin) as the Deputy Chief Minister was his lone achievement, the AIADMK general secretary highlighted the various schemes and projects implemented in Nannilam Assembly Segment during the erstwhile AIADMK regime.\n“You have asked me what the AIADMK had done to the people, now I challenge you to list the schemes/projects your government had done to the people”, he said.\nClaiming the Communist Parties had lost their steam and valour, Mr. Palaniswami said the Communists once used to raise their voice for the people, but had now remained silent probably due to their “act of bequeathing the party” to the DMK.\nEarlier, he interacted with women engaged in removal of weeds from the agricultural fields at Kollumangudi area. He got down from the van and entered the field to interact with them before resuming his journey towards Nannilam from Mayiladuthurai."

    "content": "Despite steps including GPS tracking of waste collection vehicles put in place by the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation, at least some of the waste collectors continue to evade these mechanisms and dump biodegradable waste in adjacent panchayats and municipalities.\nEarlier this week, a person attached to one of the agencies contracted by the civic body to transport waste to processing centres in Ernakulam was caught by the Aruvikkara police for allegedly dumping waste in Aruvikkara and surrounding areas. The vehicle used for dumping the waste was seized.\nAccording to Corporation officials, the civic body has terminated the contract with the person after he was arrested, but it is still unsure whether the waste that he dumped was collected from the city or from nearby local bodies or other agencies. The Corporation has contracted eight agencies to transport the collected waste daily to the processing centres in Ernakulam.\n“All of the vehicles are equipped with GPS. So, if a particular amount of waste is collected from here, we can ensure that as much amount reaches the processing centres. However, there are possibilities of over-riding this system using vehicles without GPS. Maybe, some might attempt such methods so that they will not have to spend on fuel. Also, one of the processing plants had functional issues last week. Some collectors who do not have adequate storage facilities for a couple of days might resort to dumping,” said an official.\nOn an average, 15 tonnes of biodegradable waste a day is transported from the city to processing centres. On days when festivals or major events take place in the city, this goes up to 25 tonnes a day. A team led by the Palode range officer had arrested two persons last week for attempting to dump waste in the forest area. The arrested persons had falsely claimed that the waste was being transported to pig farms."

    "content": "Additional Chief Secretary, Energy Department, Gaurav Gupta has called upon officials of Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) Ltd. to take steps for the quick and effective implementation of KUSUM-C scheme aimed at providing adequate daytime power supply to irrigation pump sets.\nThe KUSUM-C scheme seeks to provide farmers with reliable daytime electricity by installing solar units near agricultural electricity feeders. These units will generate power locally and it will be supplied to irrigation pump sets through the feeders.\nParticipating in a progress review meeting held at the CESC office at Vijayanagar 2nd Stage in Mysuru on Friday, Mr. Gupta said KUSUM-C scheme would be extremely helpful in providing seven hours of daytime power supply to irrigation pump sets.\n“Therefore, if the scheme is implemented effectively, the electricity problems faced by farmers will be resolved within the next few months,” he said before adding that officials of the CESC must work diligently to emerge as the State’s number one electricity supply company (Escom), by implementing KUSUM-C properly.\nMr. Gupta also advised the officials to resolve land-related issues, if they arise, by holding discussions with entrepreneurs and farmers to acquire the land required for implementing the scheme.\nHe advised the Assistant Executive Engineers (AEE) to respond swiftly to any problems that arise so that the corporation does not have to face public ire.\nMr. Gupta also called upon the officials to ensure efficiency in areas of billing, meter reading, meter inspection, and preventing illegal electricity connections.\nMeanwhile, CESC managing director K.M. Munigopal Raju said work orders had been issued for the generation of 842.16 MW from 153 stations for effective implementation of KUSUM-C in the CESC.\nAlso, power purchase agreements (PPAs) had been operationalised for the generation of 566.3 MW from 100 substations. “A target has been given to all division-level executive engineers to achieve a minimum of 5 MW power generation in three months,” he said.\nMr. Raju also provided details about the progress of Ganga Kalyana scheme, drinking water supply projects, PM Janman village electrification projects as well as feeder maintenance, transformer maintenance, irrigation pump set registration, and other matters in the CESC’s jurisdiction.\nThe meeting was also attended by CESC technical director D.J.

Officials were instructed to constitute committees to create public awareness at the district level.\nOn the vacancies in the Legal Metrology Department, Mr. Muniyappa said that steps will be initiated to fill up vacancies in due course.

    "content": "A letter, allegedly signed by more than 70 classmates of thegirl who ended her life in the corridorof the Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College in Balasore, Odisha, has surfaced, with the signatories reportedly demanding her expulsion.\nThe brother of the deceased, however, alleged that the signature campaign was orchestrated by Samira Kumar Sahoo, the teacher in the Department of Teacher Education, who is accused of harassing his sister.\n“The teacher had used his power to influence academic performance to get it signed by students,” he charged, adding that her classmates’ letter had caused her further mental agony before her self-immolation on July 12. Sahoo was arrested the same day.\nThe deceased girl had then alleged that her complaint of sexual harassment had gone unaddressed for long. The death has triggered a nationwide outrage.\nThe letter by her classmates alleged that the complaint against the teacher had brought bad name for the college and if the girl failed to provide any evidence, she along with her supporters should be rusticated from college.\nIn the letter addressed to then Principal Dillip Ghosh, second-year students of B.Ed. stream said the teacher was soft-spoken, highly educated, efficient and non-discriminatory and the complaint of harassment was based on lies.\nQuestioning the intention and timing of the letter, the deceased’s brother alleged, “My sister had submitted her complaint of harassment to the Internal Complaint Committee on July 1, 2025. It was surprising that the content of the complaint got leaked and a signature campaign was initiated countering her allegations on the same day on July 1.”\nHe further alleged that “as head of the department of the B.E.d programme with power to influence academic performance, Sahoo must have mobilised the signature campaign. It should be probed impartially.”\nMeanwhile, the Crime Branch of Odisha Police has started its investigation by interacting with the girl’s family members.\nThe deceased had also said the accused threatened to destroy her academic career. Do Heads of Departments (HoDs) in autonomous colleges have powers to do so? Some experts believe the threat was not entirely empty.\nIn autonomous colleges, the HoDs do play a dominant role — they design courses, finalise the list of examinees, set question papers, and decide who evaluates the answer scripts. While college authorities often claim that evaluators are external, in practice, HoDs have the final say in selecting them.\n“In humanities and social science subjects, where assessment is interpretative, it is nearly impossible to challenge poor marking. Evaluators can easily deflect accusations by citing illegible handwriting or irrational answers,” said an academic expert who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the case.\nTo reduce this concentration of power, he suggested that at least 50% of questions in humanities courses should be multiple-choice, allowing for more objective evaluation.\nWhen contacted, Fakir Mohan University Vice-Chancellor Santosh Kumar Tripathy said, “The university has no administrative control over autonomous colleges. They decide everything — from curriculum to evaluation. We merely sign certificates and declare results.”\nProfessor Tripathy argued that to ensure accountability, autonomous colleges should be brought under the ambit of the university as constituent colleges."

The case arises from a breach of privilege notice moved by BJP MLC Pravin Darekar during the Budget session, in which Mr. Kamra was accused of insulting Mr. Shinde during a parody performance. The act allegedly used the word ‘gaddar’or ‘traitor in reference to Mr. Shinde’s 2022 defection from the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and was deemed offensive by the complainant. Ms. Andhare had allegedly expressed support for the performance, which was construed as contempt of the legislature.\nThe show in question was performed and recorded at the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai’s Khar area and was later uploaded online on March 23, under the titleNaya Bharat(New India).\nFollowing the release of the video, members of the Shiv Sena, including party functionary Rahul Kanal and eleven others, allegedlyvandalised the venue in protest.\nKunal Kamra incident: Is vandalism as a response to political humour getting normalised in India? | In Focus podcast\nKunal Kamra row: After vandalism at Mumbai hotel, police arrest Shiv Sena workers, release two after issuing notice\n'Shocked, broken': Habitat Studio decides to shut down after Shiv Sainiks' vandalism over Kunal Kamra show\nSubsequently, show-cause notices were issued to both Mr. Kamra and Ms. Andhare by the Legislative Council Secretariat. However, the notices could not be delivered due to incomplete address details. Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde had referred the breach notice to the Privileges Committee in June for further inquiry.\nOn March 24, an FIR was lodged against Mr. Kamra at Khar police station under Sections 353(1)(B), 353(2) and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita by Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel, accusing him of defaming the Deputy Chief Minister. Mr. Kamra later approached the Madras High Court, stating that he had been residing in Tamil Nadu since 2021. In his petition, he submitted that he had received over 500 death threat calls and messages since the video was uploaded and expressed fear of arrest by Mumbai Police. The High Court extended his interim anticipatory bail till April 17. Mr. Kamra, however, has not responded to two summonses issued by the Mumbai Police.\nEditorial:​No country for comedy: On Kunal Kamra and Maharashtra\nOn June 7, Mr. Lad toldThe Hinduthat the11-member Privileges Committeehad approved the proposal with a full majority. “Once the show-cause notice is issued, the respondent is asked to give a written reply within 15 days. Failure to do so leads to a second show-cause notice, and in case the respondent does not respond to three notices, the committee can ask the police to arrest them,” he said.\n“Thereafter, their statement is recorded in front of the committee. The respondent can choose to apologise, or be represented by a lawyer if we give them permission, or put forth their side by themselves. Whatever decision the committee takes thereafter, it is the final decision. Even the courts have no jurisdiction in the matter,” Mr. Lad added."

    "content": "Members of the right-wing Hindu Raksha Dal on Thursday (July 17, 2025) stormed a KFC outlet in Ghaziabad, demanding a ban on the sale of non-vegetarian food during the Hindu month of Sawan. A similar protest was staged outside a neighbouring outlet of local eatery chain Nazir, leading to the temporary closure of both establishments.\nVisuals of the incident circulated widely on social media showed members of the outfit carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans such as ‘Jai Shri Ram’and ‘Har Har Mahadev’, while forcibly pulling down the shutter of the KFC outlet.\nIn the video, the group is seen entering the restaurant, confronting staff, and demanding that operations be stopped. “All of these products should be banned immediately, we will not tolerate this in Sawan,” a protester is heard shouting.\nAlso read:Why should a vegetarian order from non-veg serving eatery if it hurts sentiments? Consumer panel says\nOpposition parties in Uttar Pradesh criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the incident, holding it responsible for what they termed a deterioration in law and order.\n“Such actions are a violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. When there is no ban, how can individuals storm a food chain and force it to shut down? It is a design to create disorder in society through groups that have become mainstream after the BJP assumed power. Holy occasions are being used to fuel tension on communal lines,” Shahnawaz Alam, national secretary, Congress, said.\nVIDEO | Abhishek Srivastava, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Indirapuram, says, \"A few youths created ruckus demanding a food outlet to close. Upon receiving the information, the police reached the spot immediately and removed them. Normal operation at the outlet was ensured. A…pic.twitter.com/bnQBPZAe5A\nThe Samajwadi Party also condemned the protest. “If the BJP or right-wing groups want a ban on meat sales, they should ask the government to close slaughterhouses and prohibit the sale of meat across India for one month during Sawan. Half of the slaughterhouses are run by BJP-linked people. Such unruly action in closing a food chain highlights a failure of governance,” party spokesperson Sunil Singh Yadav ‘Sajan’ said.\nThe incident also triggered debate on social media, with many users criticising the actions of the protestors.\nSawan, also known as Shravana, is considered a holy month in the Hindu calendar, particularly by devotees of Lord Shiva. Many observe fasts and refrain from consuming meat, alcohol, and even onion and garlic during this period. The Kanwar Yatra, a major pilgrimage, is also undertaken during this time."

Chandrababu Naidu to cancel the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project and not obstruct the Palamuru-Rangareddy project.\n“If appeals don’t work, we, as the children of Palamuru, know how to fight for our rights,” he warned, adding that at any cost, Palamuru, which was neglected in the past, would be developed.\nIn an emotional tone, he said that ‘Palamuru’s son’ is now the Chief Minister and would take care of its development by fighting against all odds.\nAddressing the “Praja Palana - Pragati Bata” public meeting in Jataprolu of Nagarkurnool district, he accused former Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of betraying the aspirations of the people of Palamuru during his decade-long rule.\n“Palamuru sent KCR to Parliament depite his political migration from Karimnagar but not a single time, he raised his voice in Parliament for the disrict.”\nHe criticised KCR for abandoning critical irrigation projects such as Palamuru-Rangareddy, Kalwakurthy, Nettempadu, and Bheema. “KCR spent a lakh of crores on Kaleshwaram, which turned defunct within three years. A few thousands of crores on the pending projects would have been more useful for Telangana but KCR had other intentions,” he alleged and promised to complete these long-pending projects within the next two years.\nMr. Revanth Reddy also alleged that KCR was unable to digest that ‘Palamuru’s son’ was ruling the State and exuded confidence that the same person would continue to lead the State till 2034.\nHighlighting his government’s achievements, Mr. Revanth Reddy said 24 hours of free power to farmers, waiver of ₹21,000 crore worth of farm loans in the first year itself and ₹9,000 crore for Rythu Bharosa within nine days were welfare schemes that opposition parties failed to notice.\nHe also took pride in his government providing ₹344 crore worth of interest-free loans to 3.52 lakh self-help groups across Telangana. Specifically, in the Kolhapur constituency, ₹6.33 crore was given to 2,671 groups, and ₹41.61 crore was extended to 570 groups.\nHe reiterated the government’s efforts to support women through various initiatives — Amma Adarsh Schools, Indira Mahila Shakti canteens, and empowering them through petrol bunks and solar plants to compete with industrial giants.\nTaking a swipe at KCR’s alleged patriarchal mindset, he alleged that the BRS chief thought girls belonged to kitchens while the Congress was turning them into entrepreneurs and owners.\nEarlier, the CM laid the foundation for the Young India Integrated Residential School in Jataprolu and promised that within a year and a half it would be completed. He also offered prayers at the Madanagopala Swamy temple."

When we solve their issues, they will begin to form a positive opinion about the department,” he told police officers during the launch.\nAs part of the initiative, beat officers at every police station across the State are required to visit homes within their jurisdiction, interact with residents, gather details about their neighbourhoods, and note any law and order concerns they may have.\nThe officers are expected to record the data collected during these visits, enabling the police to gain a deeper, real-time understanding of their jurisdiction.\nAlthough the Home Minister officially launched the programme on Friday, implementation had already begun at the field level.\nDr. Parameshwara said that the initiative would be periodically reviewed and necessary changes would be made based on its effectiveness."

The people-oriented parties will join hands with the Communists in the days to come to put an end to the fascist rule,” Mr. Ramakrishna said.\n“The Leftist movement in India is still a force to reckon with today, because of the sacrifices in the freedom movement and enduring sufferings for the sake of the downtrodden. The BJP-led NDA government is bent on benefitting the capitalists, trampling upon the rights of the citizens and making a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Ramakrishna alleged.\nTaking a jibe at the ‘double engine growth’, he said it has pushed the country into debts instead of propelling growth. The party leader faulted the State government-led by N. Chandrababu Naidu for failing to implement the ‘Super Six’ schemes and in the same vein, flayed the former Chief Minister Y.S.

    "content": "Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday emphasised that every officer must understand the Constitution, failing which it would be impossible to implement its objectives.\nInaugurating a training programme for KAS taluk nodal officers at the Administrative Training Institute (ATI) here, he said that liberty, equality, and fraternity are the ideals of the Constitution.\n“Even after 75 years of its implementation and 78 years since independence, its objectives remain unfulfilled. Equal opportunities are still a dream. Equality and fraternity have not been fully realised. We must ask ourselves why it is so and look for solutions,” he said.\nRecalling B.R. Ambedkar’s historic speech on November 25, 1949, – the first day of the Constitution’s adoption, he pointed out that Ambedkar had warned, “We are entering a society with inequalities and contradictions. If we do not remove these inequalities, the oppressed people will destroy the edifice of democracy.”\n“This is a warning for every officer. It is everyone’s responsibility to protect democracy. Ambedkar cautioned what will happen if we fail in our responsiblity,” he noted.\nMr. Siddaramaiah said the country has many castes and religions. “Buddha, Basavanna, and Ambedkar — all worked for establishing a casteless society, yet caste has not disappeared. That is why Lohia said ours is a motionless society. Society becomes dynamic only when everyone achieves social and economic power.”\nThe Chief Minister asked, “There is a belief that KAS officers are intellectuals. But how many of you have critical thinking? How many of you have developed scientific temper? You need to introspect pragmatically.”\n“Even educated people believe in fate and the theory of karma. Does God creates such inequalities?,” he questioned.\nHe observed that unlike politicians who seek mandate every five years, officers do not face such a situation, and therefore they have a greater responsibility to implement people-centric programmes of the government.\n“A society with greater purchasing power grows economically,” the Chief Minister opined, adding that the government’s guarantee schemes have improved the financial strength and purchasing capacity of the people.\n“Our society has many talented individuals who lack opportunities. When opportunities are provided to them, there is no scope for exploitation,” Mr. Siddaramaiah observed.\nHe concluded his speech stating that inequality will persist as long as communal riots, fake news, caste oppression, and religious oppression continue.\nMinister in charge of Mysuru district H.C. Mahadevappa, Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh, in charge Secretary D. Ranadeep, president of KAS Officers’ Association Shivaswamy, and others were present."

Mr. Balagopal said he was eligible for seeking medical care in a private hospital, where the bill would have been much higher. Yet, he was being persecuted for depending on the affordable public healthcare system, he said. Mr. Balagopal was hospitalised from May 12 to May 17."

Revanth Reddy’s resignation from his post, and asked him to make a person from the BC community as the CM if he is really committed towards their welfare.\nAddressing party workers at several places in Medak, during his tour on Friday, Mr. Ramchander Rao said that the onus is on the Congress Government to ensure 42% quota for BCs is implemented in the local body polls.\nBJP has voted in favour of the BC quota bill in the Assembly and offered support for the purported ordnance but the Congress Government has been spreading false information about the Centre not accepting the quota plea, he claimed.\nHe questioned if the ruling party was not aware of the legal complications of having 10% for Muslims from within the BC quota as it would adversely affect the latter and reiterated the party’s opposition to reservations based on religion. Vote bank politics was behind the move, maintained the BJP chief.\nThe former MLC said it was the BJP which has set up the National BC Commission and more than 20 ministers in the Union Cabinet including Prime Minister Modi hail from the Backward Class communities.\nExpressing confidence in winning a majority of seats in local body elections, he said the people were itching to teach a lesson to the Congress government for failing to implement the promised guarantees to various sections of the people including farmers, students and others. The governance in the state has come to a standstill with the Chief Minister confined to Delhi visits.\nMr. Ramchander Rao claimed that the party has successfully spread its tentacles from urban to village level and hoped that people would give a chance to party in the next assembly elections. Earlier, Medak MP M. Raghunandan Rao, district party president Mallesh and other leaders accorded a warm welcome when he reached Narsapur as part of his district tour."

Narendran and Justice Muralee Krishna S. also directed the Chief Police Coordinator of the temple to submit a report on the alleged distribution of pamphlets to mobilise funds for the purpose.\nThe Sabarimala Special Commissioner was also directed to inspect whether idols and cash-donation boxes had been placed illegally on the Sannidhanam premises and submit a report in this regard.\nThe government’s counsel said the police had started a probe into the issue and  steps had been taken to inform pilgrims about this through the virtual queue platform.\nThe High Court had recently sought all files related to the alleged permission granted by the TDB to the private person to install the idol. The court initiated the proceedings based on a report filed by R. Jayakrishnan, Sabarimala Special Commissioner, who noted that the TDB had permitted the chairperson of a multi-specialty hospital in Erode to install an idol of Ayyappa made of panchaloham, an alloy of five precious metals, at the temple, without hindering the temple structure and rituals.\nThe report also took note of the distribution of pamphlets bearing bank account number, QR code, and mobile numbers that said that a two-ft high idol weighing 108 kg and costing ₹9 lakh was to be installed there.\nA fundraising campaign had started, on the strength of the ‘permission’ granted by the TDB, creating an impression that he was authorised to do so by the TDB and the State government, it said.\nThe Sabarimala Tantri had informed the Special Commissioner that he was unaware of the alleged attempt to install the idol, which was against temple rituals. The Special Commissioner sought the interference of the court in the issue and stringent directives to stop such practices in the temple."

We will oppose this move,” he said.\nMr. Murthy warned that outsourcing such essential roles would directly impact BMRCL employees, particularly when it comes to career progression and job security. “Even though the BMRCL has said that selected candidates will be trained, this still dilutes the importance of in-house staff,” he added.\nHowever, a senior BMRCL official clarified that the outsourcing decision has been taken primarily to address the current shortage of trained staff and to ensure that services on the new metro lines can begin on time. “Chennai and Hyderabad metros have adopted similar outsourcing models, which help bring down operational costs while maintaining efficiency,” the official said.\nThe official added that the move is a temporary measure aimed at meeting operational deadlines and that regular recruitment for permanent staff will continue as planned."

Now I can post anything in that account and lakhs and lakhs of people who view that will say that Supreme Court of Karnataka has said this... and I can remain anonymous,” Mr. Mehta said.\nThe submission was made before Justice M. Nagaprasanna during the hearing of a petition filed by X Corp. (formerly Twitter Inc.), which has challenged blocking orders issued by Central and State authorities under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act. The platform has alleged that these actions bypass safeguards laid down by the Supreme Court.\nThe petition also raises objections to the Central government’s new ‘Sahyog’ portal, describing it as a “censorship portal” that enables government agencies to issue blocking orders using a pre-approved template.\nSenior advocate K.G. Raghavan, appearing for X, objected to the presentation of the fake account without placing any related material formally on record. The judge, however, noted that the Centre was attempting to show how easily such accounts can be created on intermediary platforms.\nMr. Mehta further clarified that the account had not been used and remained inactive, as it would have entered the public domain otherwise. He added that the intention was only to demonstrate the potential misuse of any social media platform, not just X.\nFollowing the conclusion of Mr. Mehta’s arguments defending the Sahyog portal and the blocking orders, Mr. Raghavan informed the court that the fake account titled “Supreme Court of Karnataka” had now been suspended. He reiterated that X is “a responsible business house”."

Puram constituency, who has questioned the First Information Report registered against him based on the complaint filed by Vijayalakshmi, who had witnessed murder of her son Shivaprakash.\nWhile the police had said that the complainant’s mother had alleged that her son was murdered by unidentified assailants who were instigated by the MLA over a land dispute, it has been argued on behalf of Mr. Basavaraj that mother of the victim had only stated that unknown persons killed her son, but it was the police who arraigned the MLA as an accused though complainant had not taken his name.\nIt was also claimed before the court that Vijayalakshmi, in an interview given to certain television channels, has claimed that she had not taken MLA’s name in the complaint, but it was the police who added his name.\nHowever, the State Public Prosecutor pointed out to the court that Shivaprakash in February lodged a complaint of threat from three persons, including from Mr. Basavaraj, and that ‘threat has become a reality’ in his death. The prosecutor also claimed that the complainant’s statement to television channels is an indication of the ‘winning over of the witnesses’ by the accused persons."

The accused, a vendor, is suspected to have masterminded the fraudulent property transfer.\nThe Museum police had arrested two persons, Merin Jacob, 27, of Punalur, and Vasantha, 76, of Karakulam, in the case. The gang allegedly forged documents to register the land in name of Merin, who claimed to be Ms. Cripps’s adopted daughter, and later sold the same for around ₹1.5 crore in January. Vasantha’s uncanny resemblance to Ms. Cripps resulted in the scam.\nBesides Manikandan, another person, Chandrasenan, who purportedly purchased the property, has also been implicated in the case. The property had been registered at the Sub-Registrar office at Sasthamangalam. The investigation team has also been probing the alleged role of revenue officials in the case.\nThe fraud came to light a few weeks ago when the caretaker of the property had attempted to pay tax on the property, only to realise it had been transferred to someone else without his knowledge.\nThe police sources said Manikandan, whose anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the court on Thursday, has been absconding. A lookout notice has been issued for him. Chandrasenan was granted anticipatory bail, citing the absence of any cash transaction to prove the purchase. The investigation team will examine his bank details to ascertain the claim, an official said."

    "content": "With the Tamil Nadu Criminal Procedure Rules coming into effect, a police station can now register FIRs for cognisable offences committed outside its jurisdiction. Such FIRs must be transferred electronically and physically to the competent police station within 24 hours.\nThe Tamil Nadu Criminal Procedure Rules, 2025, were notified by the Tamil Nadu Government to align the state’s procedural framework with the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS) (New Criminal Procedure Code). Director General of Police (DGP) and Head of Police Force (HoPF) Shankar Jiwal toldThe Hindu, “These rules institutionalise standardised practices across police stations and criminal courts, while simultaneously driving digital transformation in the way criminal procedures are administered. The rules are designed to ensure uniformity, transparency, efficiency, and greater accountability in criminal law enforcement and judicial coordination, procedural reforms, and readiness measures necessary for effective enforcement of these rules across the State.”\n“Sufficient infrastructure arrangements to implement these provisions are at an advanced stage of rollout, and all the police personnel have been given training on the new provisions. One of the most significant features of these Rules is the integration of digital platforms and applications for almost every stage of the criminal procedure,” said Mr. Jiwal.\nIt would pave the way for courts to serve summons through authenticated email, OTP-verified mobile numbers, or standard messaging platforms. Summons service is also digitally logged and tracked, and due service can be established through reply messages or automated links.\nThe Rules institutionalise several important practices to ensure procedural fairness and judicial compliance. In every police station, a book called the Arrest Intimation Register—whether in physical form, in e-register, or both—in Form I shall be maintained for the purpose of making an entry of the fact as to who has been informed of the arrest of the person. The police officer making the arrest shall forthwith give the information of such arrest and the place where the arrested person is being held, whether by electronic communication or otherwise, to any of his relatives.\nAs per the rules, the eSakshya Mobile Application—a mobile and web platform—is now mandated for recording audio-visual evidence, uploading photographs of crime scenes or witnesses, and generating immutable SID packets (secure, geo-tagged, time-stamped evidence with hash verification). This strengthens the chain of custody and evidence admissibility.\nThe rules require the mandatory maintenance of several electronic or physical registers to capture key procedural events, incoluding:Arrest Intimation Register (Form I):Captures who was informed of the arrest and how, including in the case of foreign nationals.Summons Register (Form II):Maintains detailed records of summons issued, served, or pending, with monthly abstract reports.e-Information Register (Form V):Records electronic complaints, with provisions for confirming authenticity via in-person appearance within three days.Non-Cognizable Offence Report and Register (Forms VI–VIII):Structured tracking and reporting of non-cognizable complaints and forwarding to magistrates.Police Reports and Final Investigation Reports (Forms XI & XII):Clear formats and timelines are defined for filing charge sheets and supplementary reports, including information to be shared with informants and the courts via post or email.\nThe rules institutionalise digital evidence management through unique SID ID packets with geo-tags and hash-based authenticity verification. The digital certificates are generated via the eSakshya app for court submission will be tamper-proof evidence.\nMr. Jiwal said that for effective implementation, the Tamil Nadu Police has ensured testing of digital platforms such as CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Networking System)-II, eSakshya, and e-summons has been completed. Adequate hardware (tablets, body cameras, servers) and technical support at the police station level have been provided. Periodic training and capacity-building for all investigating officers, Station House Officers (SHOs), court staff, and prosecutors are underway.\nThe Tamil Nadu government’s notification of the TN Criminal Procedure Rules had earlier enabled greater access to the criminal justice system. Now, information regarding a criminal incident can be filed through email, the police website, or even through SMS to the concerned Station House Officer.\n“With regard to non-cognisable cases, it is now mandatory on the part of the police to receive a complaint, register it, and forward the same to the court. An acknowledgment receipt is the right of the complainant. A new format has been introduced to submit documents in criminal courts,” said R. Karthikeyan, law lecturer."

It will be held after a long gap since the constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) last deliberated on the country's political situation jointly.\nVIDEO | Delhi: AAP leader Sanjay Singh speaking on distancing from the INDIA alliance, said, \"The INDIA alliance coalition was formed for the Lok Sabha elections. Post that, we contested alone in the Haryana and Delhi elections, as well as the Punjab bypolls. We are now…pic.twitter.com/Ds7yVj4dei\n“The AAP has cleared its stand. The INDIA bloc was for the (2024) Lok Sabha polls. We fought the Delhi and Haryana Assembly polls on our own. We are going to fight the Bihar election solo. We fought the bypolls in Punjab and Gujarat all by ourselves. The AAP is not part of the INDIA. We will strongly raise issues in the Lok Sabha. We have always played the role of a strong opposition,” Mr. Singh toldPTIVideos.\nThe senior leader also said the AAP will not attend the INDIA bloc meeting.\nThe Arvind Kejriwal-led party contested the2024 Lok Sabha pollsin Delhi and Haryana in an alliance with the Congress. The alliance drew a blank in Delhi, with theBharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP)clean sweep for a third time in a row.\nSlamming the Congress, Mr. Singh questioned its role in leading the Opposition bloc.\n“It is not child’s play. Did they hold any meeting after the Lok Sabha polls? Was there any initiative to expand the INDIA bloc? Sometimes they criticise Akhilesh Yadav, sometimes Uddhav Thackeray and sometimes Mamata Banerjee. The INDIA should have been united. The Congress is the biggest party in the bloc. But did it play a role (in ensuring opposition unity)?” he asked.\nOn the AAP's role in opposing the Government, the Rajya Sabha MP said his party has always been strongly opposing the ruling dispensation. “We will do it with full strength. The INDIA can do whatever it wants,” he added.\nAccording to a senior AAP functionary, the party will raise the issues ofOperation Sindoor, thedemolition of slums in Delhiand the ongoingSpecial Intensive Revision(SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar in the upcoming session of Parliament.\nAfter winning theVisavadar Assembly bypoll in Gujarat, Mr. Kejriwal had alleged that the ruling BJP had sent the Congress to defeat his party by cutting its votes.\n“When the Congress failed, the BJP even reprimanded it. The INDIA bloc was only for the Lok Sabha polls. Now, there is no alliance from our side,” Mr. Kejriwal said earlier this month."

A token protest will be held at 11 a.m. on July 21, marking the 31st anniversary of the 1994 Kerala High Court order that led to the formation of the board.\nV.V. Sreenivasan, chairman of the Coordination Committee, pointed out that none of the directions in the High Court order—apart from the formation of the Board—had been implemented by the State government, despite the political changes over the years.\nThe temples under the MDB still follow the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, instituted during the British era, while other Devaswom Boards in the State follow different legislation. As a result, employees under the MDB are denied many of the benefits enjoyed by their counterparts in other boards. This has led to several disputes over the wage structure of MDB staff. Meanwhile, a comprehensive Devaswom law framed by the State government eight years ago is yet to be implemented.\nThe coordination committee had staged a 64-day-long protest a few years ago, which failed to achieve the desired results."

    "content": "As we wait for Bibin Chacko outside his house in the interiors of Thiruvaniyur, near Kochi, we spy the hood of a ‘car’. The low-slung car, almost grazing the ground, is covered with tarpaulin. That ‘handmade car’ is Bibin’s claim to fame, and one that his father, Chacko TO hopes would get him a job with an automobile company, “Lamborghini even!” he jokes. Lamborghini because the car Bibin fabricated is a replica of Lamborghini Huracan LP 610-4.\nBibin, an employee of the nearby OEN India, is excited about the attention the ‘car’ has been getting. “The two things I have not made are the tyres and the engine, which belongs to a Maruti Suzuki 800. Everything else, I made myself,” he says as his proud father looks on. At the time he built the car, he had never seen one in real life.\n“I thought I might never be able to own one, so why not build one,” says Bibin, who started building his car when he was in second year of college. The building, in earnest, was the work of three years, says the mechanical engineer who graduated from ToC-H Institute of Science and Technology, Arakkunnam.\nHis initial resource was the internet, where he found the measurements of the car. “I then bought the tyres, second hand so that I could start building. This is a scaled version of the original,” he clarifies.\nHe first chalked the outline of the car, based on the measurements, on the terrace of his house. Then came the chassis, which he built, followed by 8mm metal rods to build the frame, which was then covered with cardboard and fibre plaster. He even cut and welded the metal himself. Initially, the engine he used belonged to an autorickshaw.\nBibin built the chassis and the structure of the car on the terrace of his house \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                THULASI KAKKAT\nThere is no windshield yet, the steering wheel, gear shift, instrument cluster and ‘seats’ are rudimentary, and it needs a coat of paint. When I tell him about the green Porsche 911 I saw in Kochi, Bibin says, “I wanted the candy red shade, but when I enquired I learnt it is super expensive so now I am undecided about the colour.”\nThis did not happen in one go, says Chacko. “It happened over a period of several years. We could not help him financially, but encouraged him in every other way possible.” Bibin smiles, “Yes, that my parents did. Without their support I could not have indulged in this hobby.”\nHe bought raw materials with the money, (₹5000) monthly, he earned as a newspaper boy. “That is why it took time. I have now managed to get sponsors for the alloys!” The material cost came up to around  ₹1.25 lakh.\nThis is also the first car he has driven. “I just had a two-wheeler license, it is only after this one became ‘drive-able’ that I got a four wheeler license also. Since we don’t have a car, this is also the first one that I have driven.” As the father and son manoeuvre the car out of the gate, Bibin confesses that his driving skills are basic. The car is more of a showpiece now, not meant for the road.\n“He has been curious about mechanical things, toys especially as a young kid. Any time we bought him toy cars from the church fairs he would dismantle them. He wanted to know what was inside, and how it worked. This is an extension of that,” says Chacko. Bibin says the workings of mechanical things made him curious as a child and perhaps building this car may have had something to do with that. “I have always wanted to know how something works, so I took apart toys and phones and put them back together.”\nBibin has not decided what he intends to do with his car. There have been enquiries about it from individuals asking if it is for sale, then there have been enquiries about if he could fabricate another, “I am not sure what I want to do. First, I want to complete the car. I wouldn’t mind taking it as part of shows to other cities…I have not decided. Let’s see!”\nSo has he seen a Lamborghini Huracan in real life? “Yes, in 2024 when someone came in the car for a function at a nearby college!”\nBibin has documented the entire process on his YouTube channel BC CUSTOMS (@bibinchacko326)"

    "content": "Cases of violence against women are not being fast-tracked as there is no infrastructure for the same. In the absence of fast-track courts for women, how to ensure justice for those who file cases remains a problem, J. Sandhya, lawyer and secretary of the Sakhi women’s resource centre, has said.\nShe was speaking at a panel discussion ‘Bridging gaps, building systems: A roadmap to address violence against women and girls in Kerala’ on the second day of a two-day workshop on ‘Strengthening institutional mechanisms combating violence against women and girls’ organised by the Kochi-based Centre for Public Policy and Research (CPPR) in association with the U.S. Consulate General, Chennai, here on Friday.\nMs. Sandhya said that courtesy the Supreme Court, cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were being fast-tracked. However, the situation was different when it came to cases of violence against women. In Thiruvananthapuram, there was one fast-track court for women and children together, not for women alone.\nShe said the nation had some good laws such as the Domestic Violence Act. Criminal laws too had been revamped considerably, especially those related to sexual assault of women. How effectively were these laws implemented remained a question.\nThough a number of institutional mechanisms had been put in place for children since 2006, in the case of women such systemic interventions were very few, she said.\nBindu Gopinath, Additional Director of the Women and Child Development department, called for inter- and intra-departmental convergence to tackle gender-based atrocities. As part of efforts to strengthen institutions, she underlined the need to rethink human resource utilisation of the State by reforming its recruitment policy and capacity-building initiatives.\nShe advocated for implementation of standard operating procedures (SOP) across institutions to expedite legal processes and urged stronger review and accountability mechanisms to ensure better institutional responses to gender violence.\nReshma Thomas, a gender audit facilitator, said gender audits should be institutionalised. They should be held every two or three years and should be participatory, involving review of policies and documents and holding of surveys, workshops, and face to face interviews instead of going through a checklist in order to better understand gaps and take steps to address them.\nEvery six months, institutions should examine what their targets were and where they stood and where funds had been utilised. It was also important to hold people accountable, she said.\nBindu V.C., managing director, Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation; Divya Kodoth, resource person, Gender Park; and Ragashree D. Nair, chief executive officer of Medicaid Ethos Pvt. Ltd.; participated in the discussion."

The civic body hopes to rake in an additional revenue of nearly ₹500 crore through advertisement fee that ranges between ₹50 and ₹90 a sq. ft of the hoarding, depending on the guidance value of land in the area. Hoardings will not be allowed around Vidhana Soudha.\nThe State government on Thursday issued the final notification of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (Advertisement) Bylaws - 2024, a new ad policy pending for years. The Draft of the bylaws was issued in July 2024, and a final notification has been issued with a few changes, incorporating objections that came for the draft.\nFor instance, the draft bylaws listed road widths in feet, while the final notification lists it in metres. The draft said no advertisement, apart from self-advertisement, will be allowed on a road less than 60 ft wide. The advertisement fee was in the range of ₹40 and ₹110, which has now been revised to in the range of ₹50 and ₹90. The total horizontal length of hoardings at a circle has been revised from 60 ft to 120 ft, and the maximum height of a hoarding from the ground has been raised from 75 ft to 30 metres (over 98 ft).\nWith the new ad policy coming into force, the stage is now set for the civic body to give out rights to put up advertisements in the city through an open auction/tender. Before that, the BBMP should divide the whole city into suitable stretches of roads, circles, and areas, where paid advertisements shall be permissible through a notification.\nChief Civic Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao said the civic body estimates to mop up additional revenue of about ₹400 to ₹500 crore through outdoor advertisement. The civic budget for 2025-26 estimates ₹750 crore revenue from the advertisement fee (as per new policy).\nHowever, the notification of road stretches, circles where advertisements will be allowed, and auction for advertising rights of the same will take time and this year, the revenue from this source will likely be lesser than what was estimated in the budget, sources said.\nThe new advertisement bylaws for the first time allows advertising on private lands, lands owned by other agencies like Indian Railways, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) or bus stands of the KSRTC, and the BMTC, and public sector units. The revenue will be shared with the BBMP, the sources said.\nWhile the BBMP will auction advertising rights on road stretches, advertisers need to broker deals with individual property owners, including government agencies, to put up hoardings on them, and these property owners will have to pay additional property tax over the same.\nThe bylaws imposes several restrictions on outdoor advertising. For instance, it bans video advertising, imposes restrictions on neon lights, bans any advertising on trees, streetlights, electricity poles, on footpaths, abutting public roads, 50 ft from a traffic signal on all arms of the signal, 50 metres from any place of worship, etc.\nThe bylaws also constitute an Advertisement Regulatory Committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary of the Urban Development Department. The bylaws brings in several reforms, including making the entire process online. Each outdoor advertisement will have to carry a QR code which when scanned should provide all details of the advertisement and any violation will make it liable to be removed."

Security Council, especially the 1267 Committee of the UNSC, an important counter terrorism mechanism that designates terrorists and their organisations.\nSeveral Pakistani terrorist groups and individuals are listed under the UN Security Council's 1267 sanctions regime, which imposes asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes. These include LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), along with key figures like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar.\nHighlighting the importance of the U.S. designation of TRF as a terrorist group, Pakistan's dailyDawnsaid in its report that Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned LeT.\nTwenty-six people were killed in the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. The TRF claimed responsibility for the attack, but later backtracked as tensions soared between India and Pakistan."

    "content": "The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has rolled out a special initiative offering a one-time opportunity for unregistered employers and employees, including contractual and temporary workers, to enrol in the ESI scheme without facing inspections or demands for past dues.\nThe initiative called SPREE (Scheme for Promotion of Registration of Employers and Employees), which has been active since July 1, 2025, will be on till December 31, 2025.  In Karnataka, the ESI scheme is providing social security cover to 35 lakh insured persons and their family members, totalling 1.4 crore beneficiaries registered through 1.87 lakh employers.\nAddressing presspersons here on Friday, Manoj Kumar, Regional Director, ESI Corporation, Bengaluru, said employers could digitally register their units and employees via the ESIC, Shram Suvidha, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs portal under SPREE.\n“The registration will be considered valid from the date declared by the employer. No inspection or demand will be made for the pre-registration period,” he said.\nMr. Kumar said the scheme would eliminate the fear of retrospective penalties, legal action due to non-registration and backdated dues and simplifies the registration process.\nPointing out that the ESI Corporation has also launched/approved a one-time ‘Amnesty Scheme 2025’, Mr. Kumar said the scheme would help resolve disputes and encourage compliance.\n“It offers a window for dispute resolution from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2026, with an aim to reduce litigation by providing a mechanism for mutual settlements, promoting ease of doing business, and fostering goodwill among the employers, “ he said.\nBesides, the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme has been recently approved by the Centre. “Under this scheme, the first-time employees registered with the EPFO will get one month’s wages up to ₹15,000. Besides, employers will be given incentives for two years for generating additional employment. A sum of ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 monthly incentives per new employee with extended benefits for another two years will be given for the manufacturing sector. The benefits of ELI scheme will be applicable to jobs created between August 1, 2025 and July 31, 2027,” he said."

This is among the first such convictions in India and the first in West Bengal.\nThe 70-year-old victim lost ₹1 crore and was digitally arrested for almost seven days. On November 6, 2024, the victim lodged a complaint at Kalyani, Ranaghat Police Station. The Ranaghat Cyber Crime Police Station formed a special investigation team and conducted an investigation. According to the victim, he was asked to deposit money into various accounts by a WhatsApp caller who identified themself as SI Hemraj Koli of Andheri PS, Mumbai.\n“A total of 108 NCRP complaints were registered against this gang. Over 100 crores has been stolen by such gangs in this manner, including ₹1 crore in this particular case,” a high-ranking official of West Bengal Police said.\nIn this case, 13 people were arrested during raids conducted by the West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department’s (CID) Cyber Crime cell. Three are from Gujarat, seven from Maharashtra, and three from Haryana; nine of them were convicted.\nIt was found that the calls were made from Cambodia, and money was siphoned through multiple accounts whose owners were spread across the country. But later the police realised that the calls were being rerouted through Cambodia, but the origin was in India.\nMultiple bank passbooks, ATM cards, SIM cards, and mobile phones were seized. Police filed a 2,600-page chargesheet against the nine accused. The chargesheet was submitted to the Kalyani District Court, and the trial was completed in five months.\nOfficials confirmed that the Kalyani District Court sentenced the nine convicts to life imprisonment on Friday.\nAll the 9 accused have been convicted under sections 316(2)/317(4)/318(4)/319(2)/ 336(3)/338/340(2)/351(2)/3(5)/61(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66C and 66D of the Information Technology Act.\nAccording to a statement shared by the Ranaghat District Police on their official social media handle on X, the same gang had targeted another senior citizen from West Bengal’s Bhadreswar area.

This prompted the JAC to launch a 92-day statewide agitation, which culminated in the issuance of Government Order Rt.

However, the JAC pointed out that the initiative had not been implemented uniformly across the State. In response, the JAC escalated the matter to the Chief Secretary at the Chief Minister’s Office on December 5, 2024. The issue was subsequently forwarded to the General Administration Department (GAD) via CMP Note No. 709/Prl Secy/(MRC1)/2024, dated January 6, 2025.\nFollowing this intervention, the GAD issued a memo on July 6, 2025 (Memo No. GAD01/SWODMDS/4/2025-SW), reaffirming that Grievance Day must be held regularly and that all pending employee issues should be resolved within a specified timeframe. Departments have been instructed to conduct fortnightly reviews of complaints and ensure strict adherence to the original 2023 guidelines."

Lakshman of the HC directed the Additional Advocate General T. Rajnikanth Reddy to get instructions in the matter after hearing a writ petition filed by an agriculturist Vadthya Ramulu who contended that his lands were sold off by private persons fraudulently to some senior IAS and IPS officers. The judge directed the AAG to explain the government’s stand in the matter by July 28.\nThe petitioner from the scheduled tribe maintained that his father late Jamala purchased the land from its original owner Nawab Mohd. Haji Khan in 1964. It was registered by the Sub-Registrar Office of Ibrahimpatnam. Five acres of this land was gifted to him through gift settlement deed in 2019 which was registered by the Maheshwaram SRO in 2019, according to the writ petition. Eventually, the authorities issued pattadar passbook to him in 2020.\nThe petitioner’s counsel submitted that four private persons, in connivance with the Kandukur Revenue Divisional Officer, got the lands mutated online on their names. But the manual records still remained on the name of the petitioner, the counsel pointed out. Using documents generated through the fraudulent mutation of the lands, the private persons sold off the land to 34 senior IAS and IPS officers, the petitioner claimed.\nHe stated that he had submitted an application to the State government to constitute a Commission of Enquiry into the fraudulent sale of the lands, but the authorities did not respond to it. The counsel informed the bench that another writ petition alleging fraudulent sale of Bhoodan lands in Maheshwaram mandal was pending in the HC. Justice C.V. Bhaskar Reddy had already directed the Revenue and the Registration department not to permit any further transactions on the said lands in that writ petition.\nJustice Lakshman directed the Registry to tag both the pleas together and adjourned the matter to July 28."

    "content": "Terming it a ‘cancer-causing farming’, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), the farmer’s wing of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), on Friday (July 18, 2025) demanded the cancellation of the permission granted to test Genetically Modified (GM) maize in Punjab Agricultural University’s fields.\nEarlier this week,The Hinduhad published that the field trials of two kinds of GM maize are expected to beginin the ongoing kharif (summer) season at Punjab Agricultural University, days after the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the country’s top regulator for the sector, gave the approval for the trials upon receiving consent from the Punjab government.\nThe decision was taken last month by the committee, which recommended a proposal by Bayer Crop Science Limited for the conduct of confined field trials on herbicide-tolerant transgenic maize, and insect-resistant transgenic maize at the Ludhiana-based university for this year’s kharif season.\nObjecting to the plan, a delegation headed by BKS Punjab chief Ravinder Singh Dhillon submitted a memorandum to the Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University.\nThe organisation said that the largest producer of GM corn is the U.S., which uses about 80% of this crop for animal feed and uses 20% to make ethanol, plastic, etc. “But in India, less amount of ethanol is produced from corn and maximum is used as human food. There is a strong possibility of adulteration at all places from farming to purchasing, processing, market, food, etc. We want organic, not GM,” the BKS delegation said in the memorandum.\nThe farmers’ body also warned that the GM corn is being promoted as pest-resistant and weed-resistant.\n“BT cotton, a genetically modified pest resistant plant cotton, was brought to India and insects started eating it soon after its introduction. Later, more toxic BT-2 was introduced which witnessed the same fate as white flies and sucking insects started destroying the cotton crop. It is clear from this that the use of pest-resistant GM cotton turned out to be uncertain, unsafe and full of adverse effects. Hence, the way of giving permission to test GM corn is also an attempt to bring the failed experiment back on the farmers,” it added.\nBKS stated that after the failure of GM cotton in the name of pest-resistance, now weed-resistant experiments are being secretly spread among the farmers. They added that there is a danger due to this of destruction of crops and biodiversity, as well as a vicious cycle of spreading cancer in farmers’ families for free through the chemicals used in it.\n“On one hand, entire Punjab is suffering from cancer due to the ill effects of chemical farming, and is struggling to get rid of addiction. In such a situation, why is Punjab Agricultural University trying to promote the cause of cancer on the same land? This is beyond comprehension. When the people of Punjab have immersed themselves in the anti-drug movement, then the attempt to make the soil, water and air of Punjab more poisonous and addictive through GM is highly condemnable,” the organisation stated."

The government would give 100% subsidy to 58.89 lakh Kutir Jyoti BPL power consumers for installing rooftop solar panels.\nOut of 1.86 crore domestic power consumers of the State, 1.67 crore consumers consume up to 125 units per month, Development Commissioner Pratyaya Amrit said while making it clear that it would provide 100% subsidy up to 125 units. No fixed charge and other charges will be levied on households consuming up to 125 units, he added.\nMr. Amrit added that the relief would reflect in the next power bill cycle for July.\nThe decision to give free 125 units will not be applicable to commercial and industrial consumers.\nMaking it clear that the move will be applicable to all types of 1.86 crore domestic consumers across the State, Manoj Kumar Singh, who is also the Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd (BSPHCL), Patna, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, said that “consumers using above 125 units will continue to get subsidised rate of electricity under Mukhya Mantri Vidyut Upbhokta Sahayta Yojana.”\nIf a person consumes 200 units of electricity in a month, 125 units will be deducted from 200 consumed units and the person will be charged on the remaining 75 units at subsidised rate. “All the domestic consumers are getting covered with the decision. No family will be spared from the benefit,” Mr. Singh emphasised.\nTalking about installing rooftop solar panels for Kutir Jyoti BPL consumers, Mr. Singh further said that ₹60,000 is the cost for installing rooftop solar panels and the consumers will get ₹33,000 as subsidy under Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Yojana and the remaining cost of ₹27,000 will be borne by the state government.\nThe move to give free power up to 125 units is expected to increase the State’s subsidy burden. The government is currently giving an annual subsidy of ₹15,995 crore to power consumers in the current financial year which is 4% more than the previous year’s subsidy amount of ₹15,343 crore.\nThe announcement of subsidised free power will put an additional financial burden of ₹3,797 crore, taking the total annual subsidy amount to ₹19,792 crore."

    "content": "The Kerala High Court has dismissed the bail plea of Sayid Muhammed of Vadakara, who had been arraigned as the fifth accused in a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\nThe allegation was that he was involved in laundering ₹121 crore in connection with a Chinese loan app scam. He allegedly arranged 289 mule bank accounts in the name of individuals and shell business entities, for which he reportedly received remuneration from cyber fraudsters. He was arrested in February 2025 and has been in custody since then.\nOpposing his bail plea, the ED submitted that he paid ₹5,000 per account to arrange the mule bank accounts, which were allegedly used to operate illegal loan applications that cheated the public. A probe revealed that money collected from victims through online platforms was credited into mule accounts. These were then routed through these accounts and parked in different companies, which were merely shell entities. The ED also alleged that the funds were eventually diverted to bank accounts that were maintained outside India.\nThe agency further said that ₹121 crore was collected from victims and transferred to four foreign wallets located outside the country. While dismissing his bail plea, the Bench of Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas observed that the materials clearly indicated the accused’s active involvement in acquiring and transferring the proceeds of crime."

Neither is he a Mughal emperor nor any king, he should avoid such vocabulary. It is not appropriate at all. The Prime Minister should stop using such terminology,”Mr. Jha said while addressing the press at the party office.\nHe added, “It is a humble request from PM Modi not to change the wrapper of running projects, nor to change the wrapper of those projects which have already been announced in the budget. We don’t have any ill intention towards any of the states, but all the capital flow is for Gujarat, and you come to Bihar to inaugurate B-grade trains so that labourers can go to Gujarat.”\nLashing out at the PM, Mr. Jha alleged that Mr. Modi does everything for Gujarat but nothing for Bihar.\n“The tradition of investing capital in Gujarat and taking labourers from Bihar will not continue anymore,”Mr. Jha said.\nHe asked those who talk about making Patna like Pune should tell whether they have ever seen such scary images in Paras Hospital in Bihar?\nThe RJD leader mentioned about the private hospital shootout in which a prisoner was shot dead inside hospital by five shooters on Thursday and police are yet to make any breakthrough in the case.\nThe RJD leader asserted that what will Mr. Modi say when the situation in Bihar is like Mahajungle Raj and he also knows that a government with no sensitivity is running in Bihar.\nWithout naming anyone, Mr. Jha alleged that the government in Bihar is running from Delhi Durbar and those who were supposed to run Bihar are not even able to run their own house.\nReminding the PM about his old speech Mr. Jha said that 11 years ago in Motihari Narendra Modi himself had said that he will start the Motihari sugar mill and drink tea from the same sugar mill.\n“Till date the people of Motihari are still waiting and thinking that the sugar mill will start functioning before Mr. Modi reaches Motihari today. But nothing happened. His visit was empty bundle without any emotion and vision,”Mr. Jha said.\nHe asserted that the double engine government is forced to follow the line drawn by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for jobs, employment, development, for women and for the poor in Bihar.\nProfessor Jha listed out that in 17 months, Tejashwi Yadav gave 5.5 lakh jobs and left 3.5 lakh jobs pending.\nExpressing confidence, Mr. Jha said that in the coming days, under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, investment will come to Bihar and Bihar will bring labourers from Gujarat."

    "content": "More reports of arrest and detention of migrant workers from West Bengal have emerged from different parts of the country, with the latest incident involving the arrest of six workers from Malda district in Punjab.\nThe migrant workers - identified as Mukhtar Ali, Minjar Ali, Zakir Hossain, Rayhan Alam, Kurban Ali, and Azam - were reportedly arrested from Chanchal in Malda by the Phagwara Police Station in Kapurthala on the basis of an FIR dated July 2. The charges include offences under the Punjab Prohibition of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955.\nThe arrests in an Opposition-ruled State come at a time when there are mounting reports of migrant workers from West Bengal being detained or harassed in several BJP-ruled States, including Maharashtra, Delhi, Odisha, and Rajasthan.\nFamily members of the six detained workers claimed that they had travelled to Punjab for employment in poultry units and were “wrongly arrested” under cow slaughter charges.\nIn a letter addressed to Samirul Islam, Chairperson of the West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board, a Labour Commissioner from Malda highlighted that the six migrant workers are currently lodged in Kapurthala Central Jail.\n“They do not have the means to fight the case in the court. If arrangements can be made for their release, it would be greatly appreciated. They may be provided necessary legal assistance through SLSA Punjab or DLSA of that district for appropriate relief of these six migrant workers,” the letter said.\nMr. Islam, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, said the Board has arranged legal representation for the workers and expressed hope that they would be released soon. He further clarified that the situation in Punjab is not comparable to that in BJP-ruled States, where migrant workers are allegedly being harassed on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals."

Maheshwar Rao has directed the officials to take all measures to ensure completion of the work.\nWork on the 2.38-km-long flyover, currently under construction, was retaken in November 2023 for the second time, with an initial deadline set for December 2025, as stated in the Extension of Time (EOT) clause in the contract.\nAs of June 17, three major components of the project, segment casting, segment erection, and span installation, are under way and expected to be completed by December.\nChandrashekar, the project’s Executive Engineer, toldThe Hinduthat the additional three months beyond the December deadline are allotted for minor works, including the asphalting of the flyover.\nAccording to the BBMP’s progress report accessed byThe Hindu, out of the 762 required segments, 325 are yet to be cast, with completion expected by November. Of the 762 segments to be erected, 414 remain. Out of 66 spans, 31 have been installed and 35 are yet to be added.\nThe report notes that both the segment erection and span installation are scheduled for completion by December. Mr. Rao has instructed project officials to cast 45 segments a month to maintain momentum.\nMr. Chandrashekar added that the casting work is being carried out at the segment yard in Sakalavara village on Bannerghatta Road. “After each batch of segment casting is completed, we transport them to the site for erection,” he toldThe Hindu.\nTechnical design documents of the flyover show that the 2.38-km flyover will feature entry and exit points at Ejipura and Madiwala. Additionally, it will include an entry up-ramp near the St. John’s, and a down-ramp loop toward Sarjapur Road. This exit ramp will be approximately 110 metres away from the main exit point of the flyover.\nAccording to Mr. Chandrashekar, the only remaining obstacle is the acquisition of private land near St. John’s. He said several meetings have been held to finalise the process, which is now in its final stages.\nThe BBMP has felled 79 trees to make way for the flyover, and seven have been translocated,  said a BBMP official. If all progresses as planned, the flyover is expected to be open to the public by April 2026.\nThe initial tender for the project was awarded in 2017, but the contractor failed to make progress. The government terminated the contract and floated a fresh tender. After multiple failed attempts, the project was eventually awarded to BSCPL Infrastructure Limited."

    "content": "The Resistance Front (TRF), nowdesignated by the United States as a global terror outfit, is a proxy of Pakistan-based proscribed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The outfit was floated in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 to evade international sanctions against Pakistan, according to Indian security agencies.\nTRF has carried out terror attacks in Jammu & Kashmir’s Keran, Handwara, Sopore, Shopian, Anantnag, Reasi, and Pahalgam. Notable attacks include thePahalgam attack on April 22, 2025; the killing of nine Hindu pilgrims in Reasi on June 9, 2024; the murder of six migrant labourers and a doctor in Ganderbal on October 20, 2024, the killing of three Army and police personnel in Anantnag on September 13, 2023; and the murder of a BJP leader and two of his family members on, July 8, 2020.\nThe Indian government designated the outfit as a terror organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in January 2023. ​Founded by Muhammad Abbas Sheikh (now deceased) in October 2019, it is currently headed by designated terrorist Sheikh Sajjad Gul. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has declared a reward of ₹10 lakh for him.\n“Muhammad Abbas Sheikh, previously associated with Hizbul Mujahideen, played a key role in setting up TRF. He was killed in an encounter with security forces on August 23, 2021. ​After his death, Basit Ahmed Dar aka Abu Kamran, became its chief operational commander. He was also killed in an encounter on May 7, 2024, in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kulgam,” said an official.\nThe current TRF chief was allegedly a part of the conspiracy to assassinate prominent Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari in 2018. “Gul was instrumental in launching TRF’s digital media platform ‘Kashmir Fight’, through which threats were also issued to migrant Kashmiri Pandit employees,” the official said.\nVia ‘Kashmir Fight’, TRF indulges in anti-India propaganda, campaigns for recruitment, and also claims responsibility for attacks. Its website was registered on December 10, 2024, through an entity said to be based in Iceland. TRF has a presence on several digital platforms, including Mastodon, Chirpwire, and BiP.\n“TRF usually focused on security forces and political figures, but late 2024 onward it started to target infrastructure projects and civilians, including non-locals, in Jammu & Kashmir,” the official said.\nCiting its direct role in the Pahalgam attack, the U.S. has formally designated TRF as a foreign terrorist organisation and a specially designated global terrorist entity. “The U.S. statement acknowledges TRF’s links with LeT and Pakistan Army; General Asim Munir’s role; and the legitimacy of India’s calibrated military response through ‘Operation Sindoor’ that was aimed at neutralising the terror launchpads,” the official said."

    "content": "Fundamental lack of ideological coherence in the INDIA bloc, with many parties operating autonomously or in competition with each other, undermined the collective strength that it could have provided, and thus it had limited success, the Communist Party of India’s draft political resolution, released ahead of its Congress scheduled for September 21-25, said.\nThe 25th Congress of the CPI, which will be held in Chandigarh, coincides with the party’s centenary. The 64-page draft political resolution was released in the party’s headquarters in Delhi by general secretary D. Raja on Friday.\nThe party also underlined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala against a CPI candidate as an avoidable stumbling block for deeper Opposition unity.\nThe resolution said CPI played a significant role in bridging the ideological and political divide in the INDIA bloc by emphasising the need to defend constitutional values and resist the BJP’s divisive politics. But the alliance was limited in its effectiveness.\n“Seat-sharing negotiations were the most visible and a persistent point of contention. Many constituent parties, protective of their regional bases and leadership ambitions, engaged in prolonged and sometimes acrimonious bargaining,” the resolution said. This did not lend to a seamless and cohesive campaign.\n“Perhaps most critically, the alliance grappled with a fundamental lack of ideological coherence,” the resolution said. The ideological inconsistency, the party said, made it challenging to present a unified policy agenda that could inspire widespread confidence beyond anti-BJP sentiment.\nCPI has suggested that the Opposition, especially the Congress, should learn lessons from this example. “The Indian National Congress, being the largest constituent of the INDIA bloc and a pan-India political party, should maintain consistency in its positions on critical issues like secularism, federalism, and the direction of our economy. Ideological clarity in the current situation is a must,” it said."

I don’t know whether Mr. Gandhi knows the record of the Congress in fighting the RSS in Kerala. The very fact that he in a way equated the CPI(M) and the RSS betrays the absence of a correct understanding of the role of the CPI(M) in Kerala or India. Rahul only needs to recall how Manmohan Singh could not form a govt. in 2004 without the support of the CPI(M) and other left parties as the Congress didn’t command a majority in the Lok Sabha after the 2004 election,” he said.\nMr. Baby said “it appears that the moment Mr. Gandhi steps into Kerala, he becomes a former MP from Wayanad, where he had to fight the Left candidate and not the RSS.”\n“I hope and wish that he would be more serious while speaking against the CPI(M). Of course, the CPI(M) can be criticised. We will be compelled to criticise the Congress also, as we have done for their economic policies. We continue to criticise the Congress in a friendly manner, but we will never equate the congress and the BJP when we criticise,” he said."

    "content": "In a judgement that could have wide ramifications in electoral politics, the Madras High Court on Friday refused to quash criminal prosecution initiated at the instance of Election Commission of India (ECI) against former AIADMK Minister K.C. Veeramani for having allegedly suppressed full details about his assets and liabilities in an election affidavit filed during the 2021 Legislative Assembly polls.\nJustice P. Velmurugan dismissed the quash petition filed by the former Minister who had lost the 2021 polls by a narrow margin of 1,091 votes to DMK MLA K. Devaraji from Jolarpet constituency. The judge pronounced the result of the case on being convinced with the arguments advanced by senior counsel G. Rajagopalan for the Returning Officer and said, the detailed reasons would follow soon.\nDuring arguments, the senior counsel brought it to the notice of the court the nominations for the 2021 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu were received from March 12 to 19. The nominations were taken up for scrutiny from March 20 and the last date for withdrawal was fixed as March 22. The polling was held on April 6 and the votes were counted on May 2. The entire election process was completed on May 4.\nOn March 20, 2021 B. Ramkumar, a local resident, lodged a complaint with the Returning Officer (Additional Personal Assistant - Land to Tirupattur Collector) accusing Mr. Veeramani of not having made full and true disclosure about the assets owned by him and his close family members in the election affidavit and sought to reject the candidate’s nomination for having made false declaration.\nThe Returning Officer rejected the plea for rejection of nomination solely on the basis of a complaint related to false declaration of asset details. The complainant, immediately, challenged the rejection order by way of a writ petition before the Madras High Court and it was heard by the first Division Bench comprising the then Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on April 1, 2021.\nThe Bench observed no immediate orders could be passed on the writ petition since only five days were left for the polling. It added that the complainant could, instead, file an election petition after the declaration of the results. However, since Mr. Veeramani lost the election, the complainant could not prefer an election petition but chose to approach the District Election Officer (Collector).\nThe DEO, after receiving instructions from the ECI, informed the complainant on May 26, 2021 that it was not necessary for the Returning Officer to launch prosecution with respect to filing of a false affidavit and that the complainant himself could approach the jurisdictional judicial magistrate directly. Mr. Ramamoorthy challenged this decision too by way of another writ petition before the High Court.\nOn July 14, 2021, the first Bench headed by the then Chief Justice Banerjee wondered how could the ECI not take any action even when it was brought to its notice that a candidate had furnished false information or filed a false affidavit or had concealed material information when such candidate was obliged to truthfully make the fullest disclosure about his assets as well as criminal antecedents.\n“It is necessary that the Election Commission devises a procedure for dealing with complaints of the present kind. Ideally, a notice should be issued to the relevant candidate and his explanation sought and the matter closed by a reasoned order if the explanation is found suitable or satisfactory. If, however, the explanation is found unsatisfactory, the Election Commission should pursue the matter with full rigour, irrespective of the political allegiance of the relevant candidate,” the Division Bench ordered.\nMr. Rajagopalan said, the ECI had complied with the court order and framed guidelines on August 24, 2021 for dealing with complaints related to false affidavits. In November 2021, the ECI wrote to the Income Tax department to ascertain the veracity of the allegations made against Mr. Veeramani. The I-T department, in turn, conducted a throrough inquiry by comparing the election affidavit with his I-T returns.\nOn July 12, 2022, it informed the ECI that there were many discrepancies such as non declaration of several properties, liablities and transactions in the election affidavit. In the meantime, the ECI too conducted an inquiry with Mr. Veeramani through the Tirupattur Revenue Divisional Officer whose report was submitted in August 2022 and the commission convinced that a criminal prosecution must be initiated against him.\n“He (Mr. Veeramani) had suppressed the fact of having acquired properties abroad and had also given false PAN numbers with respect to his family members in the election affidavit. Therefore, the Returning Officer had launched criminal prosecution against him in 2024 and now, he could not try to escape from the clutches of law through technicalities such as delay in launching prosecution,” Mr. Rajagoplan said.\nMr. Veeramani had contended the Returning Officer had demitted office immediately after the conclusion of 2021 election and therefore he could not be allowed to file a complaint against him before a judicial magistrate in 2024. The former Minister also claimed that the complaint in any criminal case must be filed within the limitation period and that no person could be harassed by way of a belated complaint.\nHowever, Justice Velmurugan pointed out that the first complaint of Mr. Ramamoorthy was made even before the acceptance of nominations in 2021 and when the Returning Officer was very much holding that office. The judge also stated that he would, in the course of time, give detailed reasons in writing for the dismissal of the quash petition."

Also, he delivered around ₹80-100 crore cash (out of the above said funds received from Dipen Chawda) to “Shri K.K. Srivastava” on Chaitanya Baghel instructions,” the ED stated before the court. All the other names mentioned above are co-accused in the case.\nIt claimed that Mr. Chaitanya Baghel “is in receipt of proceeds of crime of ₹16.70 crore and has also played an important role in handling of more than ₹1,000 crore originating out of proceeds of crime”.\nOpposing the petition, the counsels appearing for Mr. Chaitanya Baghel, Faisal Rizvi and Harshwardhan Parganiha, denied all the allegations made in the grounds of arrest. They argued that the accused had legitimate sources of income, primarily drawn from the agriculture business spanning over 200 acres of land, proportionate to his expenditure as well as assets which could well be justified from his annual Income Tax Returns (ITRs)."

This is pending the completion of new sewage treatment plants (STPs) scheduled for the end of December 2025.\nThe directive came during a hearing on July 15, based on asuo motucase initiated by the bench based on news reports. The bench expressed serious concern over the river’s condition, particularly in the stretch flowing from Karnataka into Tamil Nadu, where foaming, blackened water, and foul odour have been reported.\nIn its order, the bench, comprising Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana and expert member Satyagopal Korlapati, noted that untreated domestic sewage and industrial waste from Bengaluru, especially from Bellandur and Varathur lakes, is being discharged into the river, causing significant pollution downstream in Tamil Nadu.\nKarnataka’s report revealed that 531 industries are located in the river’s catchment area. Of these, 11 were found to be non-compliant with environmental rules. While plans for 10 new STPs with a capacity of 313 MLD are underway, only four have received administrative approval, and none are yet operational.\nTamil Nadu officials reported heavy pollution of the Thenpennai River as it enters the State. Frothing, hyacinth growth and contamination of irrigation tanks near the Kelavarapalli dam in Hosur were cited. Tamil Nadu has urged Karnataka to prevent untreated waste from entering the river and improve pollution monitoring.\nA central Negotiation Committee, formed to address interstate water disputes inspected polluted sites in June 2024 and confirmed the presence of black, foamy water and a strong odour. the team also found untreated sewage from residential areas was polluting tanks and lakes around Bengaluru.\nThe bench stressed the urgency of interim pollution control measures, especially with the monsoon approaching Tamil Nadu, and warned that waiting until STPs are completed would worsen the situation. Karnataka’s legal counsel sought a month’s time to respond.\nThe bench has scheduled the next hearing for August 21, 2025, and instructed the Karnataka government to file a report outlining short-term measures to curb pollution of the Thenpennai river."

    "content": "The Ravenshaw University, Cuttack, on Friday revoked an order that barred female students, faculty members and non-teaching staff from remaining on campus beyond 5.30 p.m.\nThe order, which received backlash and widespread condemnation, was withdrawn within hours of its issuance, reportedly following intervention by the State Higher Education Department.\nThe controversial directive came in the wake of public outrage over last week’s self-immolation and subsequent death of a female student of Fakir Mohan College in Balasore, allegedly in protest against sexual harassment by a teacher of the same college.\nThough Ravenshaw University’s order was not directly linked to the Balasore college incident, its timing drew immediate public scrutiny.\nIssued by the Registrar following a high-level meeting, the notice had stated that no female students or employees would be permitted on campus or in any workplace after 5.30 p.m. until a formal standard operating procedure (SOP) was framed to ensure safety and define working hours. The meeting had decided that no women employees and research scholars would be assigned any office work during the evening hours.\nThe announcement was met with fierce criticism from student groups, civil society, and women’s rights advocates, who called it “regressive” and “discriminatory”. The maximum resistance came from the women’s hostelers residing on the campus.\nResponding to the backlash, the university released a public clarification, stating that the order had been misinterpreted and was therefore being withdrawn. Officials confirmed that a new SOP would be issued shortly, but did not elaborate on its expected provisions. As of now, normal campus access has been restored for all students and staff."

    "content": "The Kozhikode Corporation and Payyoli municipality have made impressive gains in the Swachh Survekshan 2024 rankings released on Thursday (July 17, 2025). The Corporation rose from 3,367 in 2023 to 70 this year, while Payyoli jumped from 3,707 to 596. Payyoli was also listed among the 20 cities awarded ‘one star’ in the ‘Garbage Free Cities’ category.\n“It is not about what we did this year to improve the ranking, but about what we did not do in the previous years,” said S. Jayasree, health standing committee chairperson of the Corporation, who stressed that proper documentation and timely entries under the guidance of the Suchitwa Mission made all the difference this time.\n“We have been doing our work well over the past few years, and the results were evident. However, we never gave much importance to the Swachh Survekshan Survey, and as a result, failed to present our achievements effectively during the inspections. All that changed this year,” she added.\nPayyoli municipal chairman V.K. Abdurahman believed that sustained efforts to maintain cleanliness in the town over the past few years had now paid off. “We worked diligently to achieve the best possible results under the State government’s ‘Malinya Muktha Navakeralam’ project,” he said.\nThe municipality houses a material recovery facility (MCF) considered a model for the entire State, in addition to having a mini MCF in every division. Funds have already been earmarked for setting up more MCFs wherever needed. “Installing awareness boards in public spaces, conducting awareness drives through mural paintings, and placing CCTV cameras at locations prone to illegal dumping helped us meet the target,” Mr. Abdurahman added.\nThe intervention of the Suchitwa Mission in preparing local bodies for the survey has yielded results across the State, evident from the number of local bodies, including major cities, that have made significant leaps in the rankings. This is the first time any urban civic body in Kerala has come within the top 1,000 ranks since the survey began in 2016."

    "content": "Imagine enjoying a sweet treat with no calories — just protein. Or savouring your favourite meat dish without the animal fat? Or drinking milk that doesn’t come from a buffalo or a cow? What if scientists could work with stem cell-based ‘organoids’ instead of animals in the labs?\nThese are not pipe dreams, but innovations nurtured at the Atal Incubation Centre (AIC) of the CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB), located in Uppal, Hyderabad. It was the only one from the public sector out of 10 incubators selected by NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) in 2017 under the Atal Innovation Mission, with ₹6-crore seed capital to support startups in life sciences.\nStarting with four budding firms, the institute now hosts 23 companies and has mentored about 160 startups over the past six years with total funding arranged, including support from angel investors, reaching upto ₹250 crore\n“There are 13-14 firms that have already made a mark and are generating revenue. It is difficult to say if they will produce earth-shaking or disruptive products, but they are going to do well,” affirms Chief Executive Officer N. Madhusudhana Rao.\nAmong the exciting ventures are f Althion Tech Innovations which has developed a dialysis-grade water purification unit, Oncosimis which is focused on biopharmaceuticals, Sway (or Sweetway)which is creating natural sweet protein products with zero calories, and Phyx44 which is working on cultured meat and milk, to name a few.\n“Access to equipment is key but real value lies in mentoring. We provided initial research support in our lab, guided them towards funding and scaling up. We have about 70 mentors drawn from CSIR labs, industry, intellectual property rights and other domains,” says the CEO.\nCSIR-CCMB Director Vinay Kumar Nandicoori notes that AIC has been supporting young, aspiring scientists with bright ideas by providing key infrastructure. “Moreover, they also benefit from accessing CCMB’s facilities at nominal charges and interacting with an outstanding pool of scientists,” he adds.\nThe Incubation Centre was clear about its direction from the beginning. “Our primary focus is on life sciences and biotechnology. We look for original ideas and give them a platform to test their product or process in our lab at a low rate,” says Mr. Rao.\nFrom ‘Idea to Proof of Concept’, startups are helped in developing samples in real-world settings like hospitals and are guided to understand the timelines involved. They receive help with idea validation, physical incubation, seed funding, product validation, and regulatory approvals.\nMost funding comes from Central government ministries and departments such as the NIDHI-Seed Support Programme, Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS), National Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Board (NSTEDB) and the likes.\nThe AIC conducts workshops and fellowship programmes to attract emerging entrepreneurs. “Biological sciences is a risky business. Unlike IT/ITES, turnaround times here are longer. It takes at least five years unless you import readymade products from foreign partners,” says Mr. Rao, a former CCMB scientist who has led AIC since its inception.\nAIC-CCMB’s success stems from the experience of working in a top research organisation and the “frustration and disappointment” when scientists like Dr. Rao were unable to bring their own research outcomes closer to the public.\n“I know what is required since I was in the game for many years and have a fairly good idea of what works. Having the backing of then CSIR-CCBM director Rakesh Mishra during inception and the CCMB’s brand value helped us, as people wanted to be associated with us,” he recalls.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to increased trust in science, and “suddenly we also had angel investors coming forward to fund. We are also helping such investors conduct due diligence. Usually, we nudge the startup after two years, once they gain traction, to look for greener pastures with six-monthly reviews”, explains the scientist.\nOver the years what the CEO has realised is that “many people are not smart in their spending”. “We also help them review their balance sheets, burn rates and expected product timelines to ensure they stay on course. We also support some companies virtually,” he says.\nHe says technology entrepreneurship is the way forward for the country. “People have ideas; all they need is support and autonomy. We also need technology transfer offices in all universities and labs just like the IITs,” asserts Mr.Rao.\nAIC-CCMB is also working on a revenue model where successful firms will be ready to pay back. The incubator has recently expanded its activities into wildlife conservation — helping in Hangul deer preservation, introducing a PCR-based method to test for authenticity of Pashmina shawls etc.\nBiodimension which is into bio-fabricated human tissues as efficient alternatives for drug screening, Cellverse, intending to use 3D bioprinting to create human cancer-on-chip models, PopVax which is into mRNA modelling and a few others are among the promising startups from the AIC stable\nDespite the progress, what still rankles Mr. Rao is that Magellen Life Sciences (2018), one of the first promising startups, could not get funding even after having developed a protein “1,200 times sweeter than sugar” based on an African fruit. “Fed up with the experience where he could not even get proper food labelling, the entrepreneur left for the UK and has now received generous funding. We felt bad when there were no takers then. But today, I am sure he would have got proper backing,” he says."

Passers-by spot him lying in a pool of blood, and alert the ambulance service.\nAs the ambulance arrives, paramedics evaluate the severity of his injuries, and conclude that it would be too late if they are to transport him by road to the nearest hospital. They call the air ambulance unit while stabilising the patient.\nSoon, a chopper arrives and a journey of 50 kilometres, which would have taken over an hour by road, is clocked in a fraction of that time. This was a simulation carried out by the International Critical Care Air Transfer Team (ICATT), a Bengaluru-based air ambulance service provider, during its Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) drill at the Saveetha Medical College grounds on Friday.\nWhile the set up and mobilisation costs of air ambulance services were “substantial”, they may be offset if the government entered the picture to support such initiatives, said Rahul Singh, Founder and Director, ICATT. “We have started similar initiatives in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with the help of the State governments. In Madhya Pradesh, we offer a flying time of 100 hours a month and it costs the government ₹25 crore annually. Due to the high establishment costs, we insist on a five-year contract,” Dr. Singh added.\nThe helicopter used for the drill was the U.S.-made Bell 429 – a compact 5-seater with a six-seven metre rotor radius – which can land on a 100-sq.km. helipad.\n“It has twin engines, rigid rotors, is capable of handling tough weather conditions, and is instrument flying enabled,” said Wing Commander V.T. Prakash, one of the pilots.\n“Air ambulances are used extensively by the military. Slowly, civilian use is increasing,” Mr. Prakash added.\nDr. Singh said that his company, which he co-founded with Dr. Shalini Nalwad,plans to submit a proposal to the Tamil Nadu government for establishing air ambulances services in Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai."

Sundaresan, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW), Mayiladuthurai District, who had made scathing remarks against some top police officers, sources said on Friday.\nA day after Mr. Sundaresan at a press meet accused senior officers of harassing him, the inquiry was conducted by the DIG, who recorded the statements of Mayiladuthurai Superintendent of Police G. Stalin and a few other police personnel in the district, the sources said.\nIn his statement, Mr. Stalin said the DSP had falsely claimed that he had registered 1,120 cases and arrested more than 700 prohibition offenders, “though he has not arrested a single person”.\nBy giving a press meet on July 17, 2025, the officer had violated provisions under Tamil Nadu Government Servants’ Conduct Rules, 1973, the sources quoted the inquiry officer as saying.\nStatements were also recorded from other police personnel attached to the PEW, in which they levelled various allegations against Mr. Sundaresan.\nThe inquiry officer said only the Superintendent of Police in District, and Commissioners of Police in Cities were authorised to conduct press meet and issue press notes. Mr. Sundaresan had violated the procedure by addressing journalists without getting permission.\nThe sources said the DIG, in his report to the Inspector-General of Police, Central Zone, had stated that the behaviour and conduct of the DSP “betrayed his loyalty towards the organisation for which he worked”.\nOn many occasions, he had openly displayed disobedience and insubordination of the authority of the SP. Instead of opting to utilise the grievance redress mechanism in the department, he had sought to address the media to make “baseless allegations against senior officers.”\nThe actions of the DSP not only impacted the morale and discipline of the force, but also tarnished its image, the DIG said in his report, and recommended that in view of the “violations and transgressions of the rules of conduct prescribed to be followed by an officer of Tamil Nadu Police service, suitable departmental action, preferably suspension, should be initiated against Mr. Sundaresan,” the sources said.\nAsked for his comments, a top police officer at the State police headquarters confirmed that the DIG, Thanjavur, had conducted an inquiry and sent a report to his superior officer. Appropriate action would be taken based on the remarks of the IGP, Central Zone, and other findings.\nAddressing the media in Mayiladuthurai on Thursday, Mr. Sundaresan levelled serious allegations against senior officers who, he said, were pushing the government to a tight corner. While Chief Minister M.K Stalin was delivering good governance, some officers were causing a bad name to the government. The DSP said he was ready to face suspension."

    "content": "Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Friday warned the Maharashtra government against imposing Hindi in primary schools (from classes 1 to 5) and threatened to shut down schools if the policy was enforced. He said he was not against any language but would not tolerate compulsion, calling the move an attack on Marathi identity.\nReferring to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s latest statement that Hindi would be taught in State schools at any cost, Mr. Thackeray emphasised that everyone living in Maharashtra must learn Marathi. He urged citizens to remain vigilant against what he called an attempt to impose Hindi under the guise of educational reform.\nEditorial |Language of unity: On Maharashtra and the issue of Hindi\n“When they tried to enforce it earlier, we shut down shops. If you [CM] try again to impose Hindi on our schools, we won’t just shut shops — we’ll shut down schools. I will not make any compromises over Marathi and the people of Maharashtra. Those who live in Maharashtra, to them I would like to say, ‘learn Marathi as soon as possible, wherever you go, speak Marathi’.”\nThe comments came in the wake of the BJP-led State government’s controversial policy decision — since rolled back — that would have made Hindi mandatory in primary schools. The move drew sharp resistance from regional parties, including the MNS and the Shiv Sena (UBT). Though the government has since revoked the two government resolutions, Mr. Fadnavis recently asserted that the three-language formula would still be implemented, with a committee now tasked with deciding the grade level at which Hindi would be introduced.\nAddressing a rally in Mira Bhayandar, Mr. Thackeray said: “I can speak better Hindi than most politicians in Maharashtra. My father was fluent in it. I am not against any language, but I am against its forced imposition. There is no harm in learning a regional language. There are so many languages in this country, such as Maithili, etc. By imposing Hindi, the regional languages dies eventually and loses its identity, which is the case already in many Hindi speaking States.”\nThe MNS chief accused the BJP of using Hindutva as a cover to promote Hindi dominance, stating, “This is not nationalism; it is linguistic domination under the garb of religion.”\nCalling it “unfortunate” that the Chief Minister of Maharashtra was advocating for compulsory Hindi, Mr. Thackeray questioned the intent behind the move. “This is not just about language. They are testing the waters. Their long-term goal is to sever Mumbai from Maharashtra and merge it with Gujarat,” he alleged.\nThe MNS chief emphasised the cultural depth of Marathi, claiming it has a 2,500 to 3,000-year-old legacy, compared to Hindi, which he called “just 200 years old.” He said the government’s actions were an affront to Marathi identity and pride.\nHe also referred to historical figures such as Morarji Desai and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, alleging that they held anti-Marathi views after Independence, and urged Maharashtrians to assert themselves by speaking in Marathi in all public and official spaces. “Wherever you go in Maharashtra, speak in Marathi — and make others speak it too,” he said.\nTaking a swipe at the BJP Godda (Jharkhand) MP’s threat that “Marathi logon ko hum yahan pe patak patak ke maarenge” [We will thrash Marathi people in our region], Mr. Thackeray strongly retaliated and said, “I dare you come to Mumbai, and ‘Mumbai ke samundar mein hum dubo dubo ke maarenge‘ [we will drown you in Mumbai’s sea].”\nThe rally, which comes days after MNS workers roughed up a shopkeeper for refusing to speak in Marathi, reflects rising tensions over language politics in the State and signals the party’s intent to position itself at the forefront of the Marathi pride movement ahead of upcoming political battles."

    "content": "Heavy rain on Friday afternoon left behind a trail of destruction in Hyderabad as rainwater flooded homes, forced evacuations and led to wall collapse incidents. The rain which averaged about 10 cm across the city, led to collapse of a boundary wall in Barkas area at 4.20 p.m. However, nobody was injured as a passing car on the road moved out of the range of the wall. In Padma Colony in Nallakunta, three families were evacuated after flood waters entered their homes. Rain water entered Paigah Colony in Secunderabad area. A similar situation prevailed in Chinmaya Marg, Mirjalguda with floodwaters marooning households for hours.\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has ordered officials to be alert in view of the heavy rains in Hyderabad. He advised them to work in coordination with various teams on the ground. He said that they should respond to public complaints immediately and take action.\nRain lashed southern and northern parts of Hyderabad.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Nagara Gopal\nSurpassing the predictions by weather pundits by a leap, torrential downpour brought the city to its knees on Friday, flooding the roads and forcing the traffic to a grinding halt on a number of stretches.\nA viral photo of two ice cream vendors, pushing their carts across the road in knee deep water at Gachibowli Biodiversity Junction -- with the iconic triple decker flyovers  in the background-- provided the bespoke setting to tell the story of a city besieged. Another video showed the Kothaguda-Kondapur flyover turn into a pool of water.\nThe day which started with sunny weather, a tad humid, got enveloped in stormy clouds post noon, developing into massive downpour by early evening. At several localities in the northern part of the city, it rained non-stop for more than two hours, clocking the highest rainfall of over 11 centimetres by 6 p.m.\nData from the automatic weather stations revealed that Bowenpally and Begumpet received the maximum rainfall of 11.5 centimetres by 10 p.m., with Nacharam close behind at 10.1 cm. Uppal recorded over 10 centimetres, Malkajgiri, 9.7, Bandlaguda, 9.5, and Musheerabad 9 centimetres. Chandrayangutta, Barkas, Amberpet, Quthbullahpur, and other locations recorded over 8 centimetres.\nSerilingampally, which received around seven centimetres of rainfall, took the worst beating, with flood water inundating the roads at Madhapur, Gachibowli, Raidurgam, Hitech City and Kondapur areas. With arrival of heavy flood, the Hussainsagar lake brimmed with water, inching towards its full tank level of 513.41 metres by 5 p.m.\nCommissioner, Hyderabad Disaster Response & Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) A.V.Ranganath informed that the recently revived Bathukamma Kunta lake received heavy inflows due to the rain, which otherwise, would have flooded the roads and colonies.\nTeams from the Disaster Response Force under HYDRAA, together with the Traffic Police and monsoon emergency teams, worked overtime to clear the roads of stagnant water and vehicles. HYDRAA control room received emergency calls from Masab Tank, Hightech City, Ayyappa Society, Gajularamaram, Kukatpally and Hafeezpet areas, seeking clearance of inundation.\nA statement from HYDRAA said the stormwater drain at Patny overflowed and flooded the colonies nearby, from where residents were evacuated using boats. Mr. Ranganath toured the area in a boat and monitored the rescue operations."

    "content": "For years, Sonalben Ramesh Padhiyar, 32, and Ramesh, 32, the parents of four girls, had prayed for a son. Their wish — in a country that still prefers sons over daughters — came true two years ago when Sonal gave birth to a boy, Naitik. The couple were elated and decided that they would go to the Bapa Sitaram temple in Bagdana village of Bhavnagar district in Gujarat to thank the saint, Bapa Sitaram, for answering their prayers. They never got around to doing this until July 9. That morning, the two of them got into a car with Naitik, their 4-year-old daughter, Vedika, and three relatives, and set out from Dariyapur in Vadodara district.\nFive kilometres from their house was the four-decade-old Mujpur-Ghambira bridge, which had repeatedly been flagged as structurally unsafe by the residents of Vadodara.\nA trembling Sonal recalls the moments they drove over the bridge and a part of it gave way. “I was sitting in the rear seat,” she says. “When we were on the bridge, the car suddenly plunged into the Mahisagar river below. After we hit the water, I somehow managed to smash the rear windshield and get out. I stood on top of the sinking car and clutched some cables that were dangling from the bridge. I held onto them and screamed for help for nearly two hours.”\nSonal was the only family member to survive the incident. The tragedy, which the Gujarat government said occurred owing to structural failure,claimed 20 lives and left four injured. One person remains missing.\nSitting on the floor of a relative’s house with one bandaged arm and a bruised forehead and legs, Sonal says she screamed, “Bachao! Maro dikro doobi gayo, maro gharwalo doobi gayo(Save me! My son has drowned; my husband has drowned)”. Bystanders on the riverbank and the remaining portion of the bridge recorded videos of her, but no one came to her rescue. A video showing her pleading with onlookers to save her family went viral online.\nSonal is grief-stricken and also worried. As Ramesh was the sole breadwinner of the family, she says she will now have to figure a way of providing for her three remaining daughters and ageing in-laws. Pulling herghunghat(head covering) over her head, she cries remembering how help arrived late. “By then the river had nothing to give me back except bodies,” she says.\nSonalben Ramesh Padhiyar managed to save herself but lost her husband, son, and daughter in the bridge collapse.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Vijay Soneji\nThe Vadodara district collector, Anil Dhameliya, saysrescue teams recovered 12 bodies and rescued five peopleon the day of the tragedy. The following day, they retrieved six more bodies. On the third day, they recovered one body. One of the injured victims died during treatment.\nThe Mujpur-Ghambira bridge serves as a vital link between central Gujarat and the Saurashtra region to the west. Construction of the bridge began in 1981, and it was officially opened to the public in 1985. It is an 832-metre-long bridge with 23 spans. (A span is the horizontal space between two supports of a structure.) Many commuters, especially heavy vehicles, preferred using this bridge, which helped them bypass the toll on the Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway. With the bridge closed after the incident, the only way to reach Saurashtra from central Gujarat is now through Vasad town, an extra 50 km.\nDhameliya says the bridge collapsed at around 7.40 a.m. “The community was the first responder. The police and ambulances reached within 10 minutes of the incident. Rescue teams arrived at the site by 8.20 a.m.,” he says. Officials say it took some more time to rescue the survivors.\nEditorial |Bridge too far: On the bridge collapse in Vadodara\nIn 2017, the Opposition Congress and many residents of Vadodara flagged concerns regarding the safety of the bridge. They say they had also called for a ban on heavy vehicles on the bridge. “The bridge had developed cracks and shook whenever a heavy vehicle passed,” says district panchayat member, Harshadsinh Parmar.\nSonal’s father-in-law, Ravjibhai, 72, says they begged the government to repair the “crumbling bridge”, but their requests were ignored. Ravjibhai has lost not only his son and two grandchildren, but also his two sons-in-law and a distant relative in the tragedy.\n“Ramesh was my only son. Naitik was born after years of prayers,” Ravjibhai says as he greets relatives, residents, and local leaders who have come to offer their condolences. “My wife was in shock on receiving the news and collapsed. She had to be hospitalised. My entire family is gone and the government is responsible for the incident,” he says.\nDhameliya accepts that residents had repeatedly raised concerns about the bridge’s deteriorating condition with local officers. “While some repair work had been carried out, the State government had also proposed constructing a new bridge after visits from technical teams,” he says.\nIn response to initial findings of negligence, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel suspended four officials from the Roads and Buildings (R&B) Department. “Wherever lapses have come to light, action has been taken. The government will not hesitate to take further necessary measures,” said Patel, who holds the R&B Department portfolio.\nState Health Minister Rushikesh Patel, who is also a government spokesperson, said that a high-level probe was being conducted by the R&B Department. “As per the committee’s initial findings, the collapse occurred due to ‘crushing of the pedestal and articulation’,” the Minister said, without offering any further explanation. He said that a detailed report would be submitted to the Chief Minister within 30 days.\nA view of the bridge after the tragedy. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                VIJAY SONEJI\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and Bhupendra Patel announced ex gratia amounts of ₹2 lakh and ₹4 lakh, respectively, for the families of the deceased, and ₹50,000 for each injured person.\nOn July 13, the Chief Minister approved ₹212 crore for the construction of a new two-lane bridge over the Mahisagar river, which will run parallel to the collapsed structure. He says the project will be completed in 18 months.\nOn the third day after the incident, National Disaster Response Force personnel continue to carry out rescue operations with quiet determination. Some of them wade waist-deep in the water, others carry stretchers, and a few board inflatable boats to continue the search for the missing. Officers oversee the operations from a tent put up on the banks of the river.\nWhen one of the teams brings back a body, Parmar points towards it and says, “This could have been prevented if the bridge had been closed to vehicles years ago. In so-called progressive Gujarat, it is taking them more than three days to carry out rescue operations.”\nSocial activist Lakhan Darbar, founder of a group called Yuva Sena in Vadodara, says the issue of safety first gained attention in August 2022. Parmar, who is also a Yuva Sena member, submitted a written complaint about the bridge’s condition to officials from the R&B Department and provided representations to the district collector.\n“There was no response to Parmar’s complaint and representations,” he says. “So I took it up with a department officer. He acknowledged the risks, but no action followed.”\nDarbar also shares an audio recording of his conversation with the R&B department officer. In the clip, Darbar is heard saying that the department should either repair or reconstruct the bridge given the dangers it posed to commuters. “People’s lives are in danger but no action has been taken yet. We will sit on a fast if steps are not taken,” he is heard saying.\nThe officer is heard responding that a survey by a private consultant had also flagged concerns. He admits that the bridge may not last much longer. “Even we believe that the bridge may not survive for long... how can we just shut the bridge? We have informed our superiors. A proposal to either rebuild or strengthen the structure has been sent. Our design team will inspect it,” the official says.\nBamangam is located on one side of the bridge. There are no street lights here. Villagers use torches and mobile phones at night to navigate their way.\nJayantibhai Rathod, a daily wage worker, sits outside his house in near-total darkness. His son, Atul, 21, had lost his life in the bridge collapse. Two other men from the village, Mohan Chavda and Dilip Padiyar, also died in the incident. All three of them were travelling together on a motorcycle to Mujpur to report for work at their respective companies, says Rathod.\nHe says Atul had joined a pharmaceutical company after a month-long internship only six days before the incident. “All my three children studied at night using lanterns. Atul studied very hard and we were thrilled when he got the job. I was relieved that he would share familial responsibilities. But god took him away,” says Rathod.\nAbout 200 m from Rathod’s house is Mohan Chavda’s house at the edge of a village pond. It is locked. When the hospital handed over Mohan’s body to his family, they took it to his brother’s house, which was safer and easier to reach.\n“We got our daughter married in February and had to repay a loan of ₹1.75 lakh. Mohan was planning to withdraw part of his provident fund to clear the debt and had been anxious about it,” says his wife, Sitaben.\nThe Opposition parties in Gujarat have remained united in their condemnation of the BJP government. Former Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela launched a scathing attack against the government, claiming that the tragedy is the “price of the BJP’s 30-year misrule.” Congress leaders Amit Chavda and Manish Doshi demanded a high-level judicial probe, and Supriya Shrinate said that the “hollow ‘Gujarat Model’ is another name for corruption”. The Aam Aadmi Party’s Isudan Gadhvi called it “a man-made disaster.”\nThe Trinamool Congress also criticised the government, recalling that a British-era suspension bridge in Morbi, Gujarat, had collapsed three years ago, killing at least 135 people. The party questioned the State’s infrastructure and called for accountability. “Is this the much-celebrated “Gujarat Model” that PM @narendramodi continues to champion? Will this too be dismissed as an ‘Act of God’ or will you finally accept it for what it is: AN ACT OF FRAUD!” said its post on X.\nAt least six bridges have collapsed since 2021 in Gujarat.The Morbi incident took place in 2022. In June 2023, a newly constructed bridge on the Mindhola river in Tapi district collapsed; no casualties were reported. In September that year, four people were injured when a portion of an old bridge on the Bhogavo river in Surendranagar district gave way after a 40-tonne dumper attempted to cross it. In August 2024, a small bridge over the Bhogavo river, connecting Habiyasar village to Chotila town in Surendranagar, collapsed due to sudden water discharge from an overflowing dam. No fatalities were reported.\nOut of the 7,000 bridges in the State that have been surveyed, the government has identified the ones that need repairs or need to be reconstructed, Minister Patel said.\nSince the incident, the government has shut down five bridges — two in Morbi district and three in Surendranagar district — on the Narmada canal network. Authorities have also restricted heavy vehicle movement on four bridges and listed 36 others for urgent repairs. After the collapse, the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited, which oversees the canal system, conducted technical assessments of over 2,110 bridges located across national highways, State highways, and rural roads.\nParmar is unimpressed. “They have decided to construct a new bridge only after all these lives were lost. They ignored repeated requests from the locals to check these bridges. Will this government respond to people’s concerns only after deaths occur,” he asks.\ndeshpande.abhinay@thehindu.co.in"

    "content": "In a rare crime, a thief masquerading as a security personnel — wearing a black uniform, carrying a pistol and sporting a walkie talkie — barged into a house under the garb of a search operation and stabbed a man to death in south Kashmir’s Kulgam in the early hours of Friday. He was then apprehended and handed over to the police.\nEyewitnesses said the accused, Naseer Ahmad Sheikh from Qazigund, in a military commando dress, stabbed Zahid Ahmad Banday, 25, after the latter suspected his credentials and entered into a scuffle and chased him. The victim was set to get married in a month or so, locals said.\nThe incident took place around 1:30 a.m. “Wearing an Army uniform, Sheikh entered into the house of Bandays. He directed the inmates to hand over their mobile phones. They were assembled outside the house. Thereafter, he directed the victim to switch off the lights and hand over the keys of the tin trunk box. My cousin questioned the motives of the accused and suspected him to be a thief rather than a soldier,” Suhail Ahmad Banday, the victim’s cousin, said.\nHe said the police must investigate the case and “ensure justice”.\nLocals suspected that the accused could be a part of a gang acting as security personnel and staging fake search operations. Bashir Ahmad Bhat, a neighbour of the Bandays, said the thief first searched the house of Showkat Ahmad Sheikh, another local. “The accused asked Sheikh to accompany him to the house of the Bandays and inform them about the search operation. The accused also searched for CCTV, apparently to cut the wires. On being caught, the thief jumped from the second floor and suffered injuries. He was overpowered by locals and handed over to the police,” Mr. Bhat said.\nHe said the victim was lying in a pool of blood when neighbours reached the spot and shifted him to the hospital. “Zahid was getting married soon. His father was making preparations for his wedding. It’s a heart-wrenching incident,” Mr. Bhat said.\nThe J&K police have launched an investigation into the case. However, they have not issued any statement on the sequence of events leading to the murder."

But the party did not invite me. Maybe they do not want me there; it would make them uncomfortable. So, I will not go to the Prime Minister’s rally. I am going to Delhi instead, for some work related to the party,” Mr Ghosh told media persons at the Kolkata airport before departing for Delhi.\nIn Delhi, he was seen going to the residence of national BJP president JP Nadda, and leaving in a few minutes. Meanwhile, on the same day, in West Bengal’s Durgapur, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated key development projects and attended a party rally.\nMr. Ghosh has notably remained absent from important party events and rallies in the recent past, including events attended by Prime Minister Modi at Alipurduar and Home Minister Amit Shah in Kolkata this year.\nHis absence on Friday assumes significance considering the upcoming Martyrs’ Day rally by the Trinamool on July 21. Speculations are rife that Mr Ghosh is potentially joining Trinamool.\nAmid reports of a souring relationship between Mr. Ghosh and the State BJP leadership, the newly appointed West Bengal BJP President Samik Bhattacharya had reached out to Mr Ghosh on July 8 this year.\nAfter their in-person meeting, Mr. Bhattacharya described Mr. Ghosh as the “heart and soul” of the party, while Mr. Ghosh said that he will follow instructions from the party leadership like any other party worker.\nMr. Ghosh is a senior leader of the BJP in the State and has served as a national vice president and State president of the BJP. Under his leadership, the BJP had won 18 out of the State’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.\nHe was earlier elected as an MP from Medinipur in 2019 and an MLA from Kharagpur Sadar in 2016.\nIn May this year, Mr. Ghosh drew criticism from the BJP when he met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the inauguration of the Digha Jagannath Temple. The erstwhile State BJP President, Sukanta Majumder, was quick to clarify to the media that the party had decided not to attend the temple inauguration, and Mr, Ghosh’s presence was in his personal capacity."

A woman, too, works tirelessly, but even beyond that, she influences the generations that follow. Children grow and mature under the love and care of a woman,” he said.\nDescribing women’s empowerment as fundamental to a nation’s development, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief said, “God has given women some additional qualities that men do not possess, while also endowing them with all the capabilities granted to men. This is why women are capable of doing anything that men can do.”\nMr. Bhagwat stressed that it is misguided for men to believe they are responsible for uplifting women. “There is no need for such ego. Men should simply empower women and remove the barriers of outdated traditions. When a woman uplifts herself, she uplifts the entire society,” he said.\nHe also praised the efforts of Udyogwardhini in promoting entrepreneurship and skill development among women, calling it a model for social transformation.\nThe event was attended by several local leaders, women entrepreneurs, and social workers who have collaborated with Udyogwardhini over the years."

She said women in tribal regions often faced challenges due to illiteracy and lack of access to information. However, by identifying and training active and enthusiastic tribal women, it was possible to cultivate a culture of questioning and awareness. Once equipped with knowledge of the RTI Act, these women could play a key role in solving local issues by helping others access critical information, she said.\nThe five-day awareness program was organised in Anakapalli district from July 14 to July 18 by LibTech India and the United Forum for RTI Campaign, Andhra Pradesh, in collaboration with various voluntary organisations. Tribal women from the districts of Manyam, Alluri Sitarama Raju, and Prakasam participated in the event.\nRepresentatives from LibTech India, including BDS Kishore, and members of the United Forum for RTI Campaign also took part in the event."

    "content": "INDIA bloc parties will hold an online meeting on Saturday (July 19, 2025) to reach a consensus on issues that they would raise to corner the government during Parliament's Monsoon Session and convey a message of unity, but AAP has distanced itself from the opposition grouping.\nThe TMC, which was earlier said to be skipping the INDIA bloc meeting, however, said its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee will attend the online meeting.\nThe meeting comes right before the Monsoon Session of Parliament, which starts on Monday. It will be held after a long gap since the INDIA bloc parties jointly deliberated the country's political situation.\nCongress general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, said the INDIA bloc is united and its prominent leaders will hold deliberations online on Saturday and meet in Delhi later.\nLate on Thursday night, the Congress announced that a meeting of the leaders of the INDIA bloc parties will be held online on Saturday evening to discuss the prevailing political situation of the country.\nThe leaders would deliberate on a host of key issues, including the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar, the demand for a discussion on the Pahalgam attack, and Operation Sindoor.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's claims of bringing about a halt in hostilities between India and Pakistan, and the push to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma, embroiled in a row following the discovery of burnt wads of currency at his residence after a fire incident, are also likely to feature in the discussions.\nHowever, in a jolt to opposition unity ahead of the Parliament session, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) distanced itself from the INDIA bloc, saying it is not part of the alliance anymore and questioned the Congress' role in leading it.\n\"The AAP has cleared its stand. The INDIA bloc was for the (2024) Lok Sabha polls. We fought the Delhi and Haryana Assembly polls on our own. We are going to fight the Bihar election solo. We fought the bypolls in Punjab and Gujarat all by ourselves. The AAP is not part of the INDIA (bloc),\" Singh told PTI Videos.\nHe, however, said AAP will strongly raise issues in Lok Sabha while asserting the party has \"always played the role of a strong opposition\".\nThe Arvind Kejriwal-led party contested the Lok Sabha seats in Delhi and Haryana during the 2024 general elections in alliance with the Congress.\nSlamming the Congress, Singh questioned its role in leading the opposition bloc.\n\"It is not a child's play. Did they hold any meeting after the Lok Sabha polls? Was there any initiative to expand the INDIA bloc? Sometimes they criticise Akhilesh Yadav, sometimes Uddhav Thackeray and sometimes Mamata Banerjee. The INDIA bloc should have been united. The Congress is the biggest party of the bloc. But did it play a role (in ensuring opposition unity)?\" he asked.\nMeanwhile, the TMC said that initially it was to skip the INDIA bloc meeting that was to be hosted in Delhi, but now that it is going to be held online, Abhishek Banerjee will attend it.\nOn the INDIA bloc's online meeting, Ramesh said all the prominent leaders of the bloc will attend the Saturday meeting.\n\"People would not be able to come to Delhi on Saturday due to different programmes. It has been decided that we will have an online meeting before the Parliament session. After that, we will meet in Delhi also,\" he said and asserted that the INDIA bloc was united.\n\"The question that should be asked is why the name of the BJP president after J P Nadda has not been announced till now... The BJP people need to worry about what is happening in their party and what is happening between the BJP and the RSS,\" Ramesh said.\nIn a post on X Thursday night, Congress General Secretary K C Venugopal said, \"A meeting of the leaders of the INDIA parties will be held online on Saturday, July 19, 2025, at 7 pm to discuss the prevailing political situation in the country.\" \tDuring the Parliament session, the top Congress leadership would also raise issues such as the demand for the restoration of full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and rising atrocities against women in the country.\nThe opposition party has also decided to raise farmers' problems, the issues of rising unemployment, safety and security of the country and the Ahmedabad air crash during the session.\nCongress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi had convened a meeting of the party's parliamentary strategy group at her 10, Janpath residence here on Tuesday evening.\nTop party leaders, including Congress president Kharge, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari, Jairam Ramesh, K Suresh, Manickam Tagore and others had participated in the meeting."

    "content": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday (July 18, 2025) in Varanasi alleged that the Kanwar Yatra is being deliberately defamed and its participants, the Kanwariyas, are being labelled as goons by elements who want to humiliate the heritage of India. Mr. Adityanath, who was speaking at a seminar on Tribal icon Birsa Munda, added that those who seek to defame the Kanwar Yatris are the same people who tried to separate the tribal community from India.\n“They conspired at every level to make them fight against India. This is the same community that always insults the faith of India and these are the same people who today want to create a situation of caste conflict by creating fake accounts on social media platforms,” said Mr. Adityanath emphasizing that the Kanwar Yatra embodies unity transcending caste, creed, and sect. “Today, the Yatra is progressing peacefully and with devotion, yet some label it as unruly. These are the same forces that try to mislead and provoke tribal communities. We must remain alert to such divisive elements,” he added.\nMr. Adityanath cautioned people from anti-social elements who attempt to fuel caste and communal tensions. “A few years ago, there was a case of arson. I had remarked then that such an act likely didn’t belong to any particular community. The investigation later confirmed that the person involved was wearing a saffron scarf but was shouting ‘Ya Allah’. These deceptive individuals must be exposed and excluded from society if we are to protect national unity,” said the U.P. CM, recalling an incident of a few years ago, adding the same forces who spread caste-based hatred online had also tried to provoke tribal communities against the nation. “Such elements must face strict action,” he asserted.\nPraising the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for declaring November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas (Tribal Pride Day), Mr. Adityanath hailed the decision as something which installed a sense of respect and recognition in tribal communities. “Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas is a gesture of gratitude and a bridge of communication with them,” he said."

    "content": "The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has pulled up the Maharashtra State excise department for serious lapses in its operations, which have led to a substantial revenue shortfall.\nThe CAG report pointed out that due to incorrect assessment of licence renewal fees, the State lost ₹20.15 crore in revenue and ₹70.22 crore in interest.\nThe audit further stated that failure to implement revised rates for supervision fees had caused an additional shortfall of ₹1.20 crore.\nAccording to the report, the then Excise Commissioner exempted excise duty on old stock of beer without obtaining prior approval from the State government.\nThe report also highlighted that the delayed submission of mild beer samples for chemical analysis had hampered tax recovery to the tune of ₹73.18 crore.\n\"Under the Bombay Prohibition (Privilege Fee) Rules, 1954, a provision exists to charge fees for changes in partnership. However, no such provision was applicable to significant changes in shareholding of public limited companies, resulting in a loss of ₹26.93 crore to the state,\" the CAG observed.\nThe absence of a provision in the Excise Act for declaring production cost also led to a missed opportunity for the government to earn additional revenue, it added.\nThe audit further revealed that in the case of Canteen Stores Department (CSD), the production cost of 11 products or brands was undervalued, causing a revenue loss of ₹38.34 crore in excise duty.\nAdditionally, errors in the purchase cost of imported foreign liquor resulted in non-collection of Rs 11.48 crore between August 2018 and March 2022, and ₹2.89 crore between May 2017 and March 2022.\nThe cumulative effect of these lapses caused a massive revenue loss for the government, raising serious concerns about the functioning of the Excise Department, the CAG stated."

    "content": "The Girijan Aikya Vedika has opposed the proposed inclusion of the Boya and Valmiki communities, which are currently categorised under BC-A, in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe move threatens the Constitutional validity of ST classification, apart from posing a risk to the welfare of Adivasi communities, the Vedika said.\nIn a statement on Friday, Girijana Aikya Vedika State working president Bapatla Venkatapathi said that as per Article 342 of the Constitution, only the President of India, in consultation with the Governor, can notify a community as ST, and any subsequent inclusion or exclusion requires a Parliamentary Act.\nThe inclusion process also involves rigorous examination by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST).\nThe key criteria for ST classification as per the Lokur Committee guidelines (1965) include: primitive traits and traditional livelihoods (e.g., hunting, forest-dependence), distinct culture, customs, and language, geographical and social isolation, socio-economic backwardness and shyness of contact with the wider society.\nHe noted that the Boyas and Valmikis do not satisfy these criteria in the current socio-economic context of Andhra Pradesh. With STs currently receiving 6% reservation (proposed 10%), the addition of nearly 18 lakh Boyas and Valmikis would severely burden the quota system. This threatens existing marginalised tribes like Chenchu, Yerukala, Yanadi, and Kondadora, who are already struggling for fair representation in education, employment, and governance, said Mr. Venkatapathi.\nAdivasi organisations, including the State Adivasi Girijana Sangham, have likened this proposal to the Meitei-ST conflict in Manipur, cautioning that such ‘reckless policy’ could spark unrest in Andhra Pradesh.\nMr. Venkatapathi noted that the one-man commission headed by I. Samuel Anand Kumar lacked meaningful consultation with the ST communities. Relying on such an isolated review for a critical Constitutional change undermines democratic processes, he said."

The proposed boundaries have been drawn up with balance in revenue generation and taking care to cut the least number of Assembly constituencies into multiple corporations as the guiding principle.\nSources said the five corporations have been drawn up in such a manner that the maximum difference between the estimated revenue between these corporations is not more than ₹100 Crore. A maximum of five Assembly constituencies are cut up into different corporations. However, this has meant that the corporations have a large variance in their size and population."

He went with those whom he once considered lowly,\" Mr. Shinde said in an apparent reference to Thackeray joining hands with the Congress after severing the alliance with the BJP.\nIt was because of his (Mr. Shinde's) request that Mr. Fadnavis had agreed to cede the post of Mumbai's mayor to the Shiv Sena in 2017 after the Sena won 84 seats and the BJP 82 in the civic polls, Shinde said.\n\"But he (Mr. Thackeray) betrayed Mr. Fadnavis in 2019 (by walking out of the alliance),\" Mr. Shinde added.\nMr. Shinde also claimed that while he and rebel Sena MLAs supporting him were camping in Guwahati in 2022 after rebelling against Mr. Thackeray, the latter approached him for reconciliation and, at the same time, asked the BJP leadership in Delhi not to support the rebel group.\nMr. Shinde said the Thackeray government had announced the establishment of a music school in the name of Lata Mangeshkar after the singing legend's death.\nBut when the Mangeshkar family awarded the first Lata Deenanath Mangeshkar Award to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Thackeray got so upset that he decided against starting the music school, Mr. Shinde claimed.\nWhen he became chief minister in 2022, he started the music school, Mr. Shinde added.\nNotably, Mr. Shinde's reminder of Mr. Thackeray 'betraying' Mr. Fadnavis and the BJP in 2019 came a day after the Shiv Sena (UBT) chief met the Maharashtra Chief Minister.\nA day earlier, Mr. Fadnavis, in a tongue-in-cheek remark in the House, had asked Mr. Thackeray to come over to the ruling side."

I must thank Prime Minister (Narendra) Modiji for having such a visionary idea about transforming the sports sector,\" he said.\nThe Bill seeks to create a framework for good governance in the National Sports Federations (NSFs) and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).\nIt mandates the setting up of a regulatory board which would have the power to grant recognition and decide funding to NSFs based on their adherence to provisions related to good governance.\nThe regulatory board will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with the highest governance, financial, and ethical standards. The NSFs have been brought on board after extensive discussions over several years that intensified after Mandaviya took charge last year.\nThe Bill also proposes the establishment of Ethics Commissions and Dispute Resolution Commissions to ensure transparency in governance and cut down litigation, which sometimes leads to embarrassing showdowns between athletes and administrators over issues ranging from selection to elections.\nIt has been opposed by the IOA, which feels that a regulatory board would undermine its standing as the nodal body for all NSFs.\nCurrent IOA president P T Usha has even gone to the extent of suggesting that India would run the risk of being suspended by the International Olympic Committee for government interference.\nHowever, Mr. Mandaviya has asserted that the IOC has been consulted while drafting the proposed legislation. Having the IOC on board is crucial as India is bidding to become an Olympic host in 2036.\nMr. Rijiju, who batted for autonomy of sports administrators but with greater accountability during his tenure in the sports ministry, said he is confident of its smooth passage in the Parliament.\n\"There are two (other) things — theKhelo Bharat Nitiand theanti-doping amendment Bill. These two bills (anti-doping and sports governance) are to be combined and we will discuss in the Parliament and I am sure the members will take part,\" he said.\n\"Once the new sports bill is passed, it will usher in a new sporting culture in the country. Khelo India has already promoted sports culture in the country,\" he added.\nThe anti-doping act was originally passed in 2022 but its implementation had to be put on hold due to objections raised by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\nThe world body objected to the institution of a National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports, which was empowered to make recommendations to the government on anti-doping regulations.\nThe Board, which was to comprise a Chairperson and two members appointed by the central government, was also authorised to oversee the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and even issue directions to it.\nWADA rejected this provision as government interference in an autonomous body. The amended bill has therefore deleted this provision to be WADA-compliant."
