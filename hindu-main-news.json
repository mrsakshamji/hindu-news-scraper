    "content": "The Bombay High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) rejected and refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) petition alleging that Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi violated the petitioner’s rights by making “immature” remarks about Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The petition sought the court to issue directions to the Congress leader that he should read his petition and learn about Savarkar before making “irresponsible” statements.\nThe 125-page petition, filed by Professor Pankaj K. Phadnis, 65, from Mumbai and the founding president of Abhinav Bharat Congress, a public policy think tank, mentioned history and research work by the petitioner on Savarkar.\nThe petitioner said that Mr. Gandhi, in London in March 2023, had tried to paint Savarkar as someone who takes pleasure in the humiliation of Muslims.\nHe further said that Mr. Gandhi tried to portray Savarkar as a coward and in a derogatory reference at a press conference held on March 25, 2023, where he said, “My name is not Savarkar, I am Gandhi and Gandhi does not make apologies to anyone.”\n“Rahul Gandhi is LoP in Lok Sabha and could well become Prime Minister of India in the future. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to take liberties with facts to denigrate respected leaders of freedom struggle and prevent the young from being in a position to fulfil their fundamental duties. The only way to prevent him from causing harm to the nation is by an expert such as the petitioner to step into the box, depose comprehensive facts about Shri Savarkar and allow himself to be cross examined by Rahul Gandhi to establish facts once and for all,” the petitioner said, asking the court to direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of his petition and learn about Savarkar.\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that the Supreme Court had already dismissed a similar petition filed by Mr. Phadnis and said that the court could not direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of the petition and remove his ignorance about Vinayak Savarkar. “In your petition, your prayer is to direct him to personally study and read your petition. How can the court compel him to read your petition? This court cannot issue directions to Rahul Gandhi to study the contents of this petition and remove ignorance about the contribution of Savarkar. We do not know if he will become Prime Minister or not. Do you know that he will become the Prime Minister?“ the Bench noted and disposed of the petition.\nThe court noted that a criminal defamation case had already been filed against Mr. Gandhi by Satyaki Savarkar, grand nephew of Vinayak Savarkar, and that the same was pending before a special MP/MLA Court in Pune."

He also wanted the officials to  create co-working spaces across the 26 district centres for small enterprises coming to the State.\nHe said the proposed Ratan Tata Innovation Hub, which is being developed to foster modern innovation and to promote startups in the State, would be inaugurated soon and asked the officials to take necessary steps to establish regional spoke centres in Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur.\nHe said that in alignment with the Amaravati Quantum Valley, partnerships with companies like TCS, L&T and IBM had already been formed and the officials should finalise essential infrastructure for the partners. Referring to the proposed ‘Drone City’ project at Orvakal in Kurnool district, spanning 400 acres in the coming year, Mr. Lokesh instructed the officials to create an ecosystem to support it.\nHe also wanted wide promotion to the ‘Mana Mitra’ WhatsApp governance services launched by the government. He said that out of the total 702 State services, 535 of them were currently being offered through ‘Mana Mitra’ app. He said steps should be taken to ensure internet connectivity in all the 45,000 government schools and uninterrupted phone connectivity at airports in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajamahendravaram."

    "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) held celebrations in Jammu and Kashmir over the Central Administrative Tribunal’s (CAT) decision to drop Urdu as a mandatory qualification for candidates applying to Naib-Tehsildar posts in the Union Territory.\nA bench of the CAT’s Jammu Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday stayed the operation of provisions in the Jammu and Kashmir Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, which stipulated graduation with knowledge of Urdu as a minimum qualification for the post.\nThe tribunal directed the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) to accept applications from candidates with knowledge of any of the five official languages listed in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the order, the JKSSB on Tuesday deferred the process of inviting applications for the posts.\nUnder the Official Languages Act, 2020, enacted during Central rule, Hindi, Kashmiri, English, Dogri, and Urdu were declared as official languages in Jammu and Kashmir. Prior to the reorganisation of the former State in 2019, Urdu was the sole official language.\nCelebrations were held at Srinagar’s Ghanta Ghar by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, where its president Arun Prabhat welcomed the tribunal’s order. He said the government’s earlier notification to continue with Urdu as a mandatory subject was discriminatory.\n“The notice was anti-Constitution. Our Constitution preamble with Article 14 and 16 are for equal opportunity for all and against any discrimination on the basis of colour, creed or caste. The J&K government notice was discriminatory to four out of five languages declared as official languages here,” Mr. Prabhat said.\nReacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed Ur Rehman Para accused the BJP of politicising the Urdu language and “injecting communal overtones into the discourse around Jammu and Kashmir’s linguistic heritage”.\n“BJP’s attempt to view Urdu through a communal lens marks a dangerous and disgraceful new low in our political discourse in J&K. Urdu is not a symbol of any religion but the throbbing pulse of Jammu & Kashmir’s identity, echoing collective memories and soulful struggles of our people over centuries,” Mr. Para said in a post on social media platform X.\nHe said that Urdu is the language of poets, courts, revenue offices, administration, and everyday life in Jammu and Kashmir. “Even more disturbing is the CAT’s order staying the requirement of basic Urdu knowledge for the Naib Tehsildar exam — a signal that judicial forums too are beginning to cave under political pressure,” he added.\nThe PDP, Mr. Para said, stood for the preservation of the region’s linguistic and cultural identity. “Urdu must be preserved, not just as a language, but as an embodiment of our shared heritage, administrative continuity & cultural essence that binds every region of J&K together.”"

    "content": "Air India will partially resume international flights from August 1, after the “safety pause” necessitated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 fleet following thedeadly crash of AI-171 on June 12. A full restoration of flights across its global network is planned from October 1, the airline said in a press statement.\nThe airline also announced that it will be moving three out of its five weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London’s Gatwick airport to the British capital’s Heathrow airport instead, for a period of two months from August 1.\nBetween July 16 and August 1, the airline will restore seven flights to destinations such as London, Zurich, Tokyo, and Seoul. During the same period, the airline will operate 13 fewer flights to European destinations as compared to its full schedule, and 20 fewer flights to the U.S. and Canada. Destinations in Australia will continue to see four fewer flights. Some services to London and Singapore will remain suspended till September 30.\nThe DGCA had ordered enhanced checks for Air India’s 33 Boeing 787 aircraft, which had led to long delays and cancellations of flights, inviting flak from passengers.\nFollowing the DGCA’s intervention, Air India announced it was curtailing 15% of its internatIonal flights due to disruptions caused due to a combination of factors, including airspace closures over Pakistan and the Middle East. The cut was announced for a period of a month, and later extended until the end of July.\nTuesday’s (July 15, 2025) announcement also follows last week’s interim probe report into the June 12 crash that killed 260 people. The report did not recommend any extra measures for either the aircraft type or its engines.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson told airline employees on an internal platform that all Boeing 787s had been checked since the crash, and were found “fit-to-fly”. Since the interim report found that the lock on the switches that supply fuel to the two engines had moved or “transitioned” before both engines shut down, the airline has also started inspecting the lock feature for the fuel control switches. This exercise has been carried out for 50% of Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet.\nOn Monday (July 14, 2025), the DGCA ordered all airlines with Boeing aircraft to carry out this inspection by July 21."

    "content": "The unemployment rate (UR) among people aged 15 and above has remained the same at 5.6% in May and June 2025, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation here on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nWomen’s participation in labour force, both in urban and rural areas, decreased by one percentage point in June compared with May. The government said there is a “marginal decline” in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men too.\nThe Ministry said the LFPR in current weekly status (CWS) among all persons aged 15 and above was 54.2 % during June this year as compared to 54.8% during May 2025. “The LFPR in rural areas was 56.1% and LFPR in urban areas was 50.4% during June 2025 for persons of the same age group,” the Ministry said. The LFPR for males aged 15 and above in rural and urban areas were respectively 78.1% and 75% during June 2025, and it marked a marginal decline from the corresponding LFPR estimates of 78.3% and 75.1% respectively for rural and urban areas during May 2025.\nFor females, the LFPR for age 15 years and above for rural areas was 35.2% in June 2025. This was 36.9% in May and 38.2% in April. In urban areas, the LFPR for females aged above 15 was 25% in June. It was 25.3% in May. For females of all age groups in both rural and urban areas, the LFPR was 24.5% in June and it was 25.5% in May.\nThe unemployment rate for females and males of all ages above 15 was 5.6%. While for men, the rate remained same as of May, for females there was a decrease in UR by 0.1 percentage point. While the rural unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the urban unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points between May and June.\nThe worker population ratio (WPR) for people of all ages above 15 in both urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 38.7% compared to 39% in May.\nThe Union Government said the marginal decline in LFPR and WPR in June was largely influenced by seasonal agricultural patterns, intense summer heat limiting outdoor physical work, and a shift of some unpaid helpers, particularly from higher-income rural households, towards domestic chores. It said the share of rural female workers in agriculture dropped from 70.2% in May to 69.8% in June, indicating the reduced need for agricultural engagement among women, “perhaps due to a decline in rural inflation”.\nThe Ministry had started releasing monthly figures of employment and unemployment data since April for a better perspective of the situation. “The number of households surveyed was 89,493 (49,335 in rural areas and 40,158 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 3,80,538 (2,17,251 in rural areas and 1,63,287 in urban areas),” the Ministry said."

Mr. Rana has not yet attained the age of 65.\nHowever, Mr. Rana’s counsel, advocate Piyush Sachdeva, submitted that the accused is 64 years and six months old and suffers from medical conditions that warrant special consideration.\nThe NIA informed the court that it has submitted Mr. Rana’s complete medical history to the jail authorities.\nThe matter has been posted for further hearing on July 25.\nExtradited from the United States on April 10, Mr. Rana, 64, is facing trial in connection with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which left more than 166 people dead.\nThe NIA, which is investigating the case, has charged Mr. Rana with conspiring in the attacks along with his associate David Headley. Headley, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, is accused of conducting planning and reconnaissance for the attacks at the behest of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed."

He also favoured reservation in private sector.\n“We must demand political representation and ensure that backward classes will have a proportional voice in all decision-making bodies. Economic opportunities should be expanded through reservation in private sector jobs, government promotions and contracts, financial support and schemes, and access to markets,” he told the delegates at the first meeting of the council here on Tuesday.\n“Awareness campaigns to combat discrimination and ensure social integration, build a strong sense of backward class consciousness, which brings awareness of social reality, strength in numbers and right to equality. This political awakening will fuel aspiration, solidarity and long- term change,” he said, outlining the responsibility for the council, which comprises 24 leaders, including former Chief Ministers, former Ministers and Members of Parliament.\nThe council has been set by the AICC to deliberate and strategise party’s response in the OBC politics across the country and woo back the OBC voters to the party fold.\nMr. Siddaramaiah, a member of the panel, said the Council must become a platform that transforms socio economic and educational caste census from a political debate into constitutional necessity. “It should provide space that ensures backward classes voices shape policy, not just manifestos and a force that mobilises intellectual capital, youth energy and grassroots strength to build leadership emerging from the oppressed classes.” He said the council is not a formality, but “soul of India’s social justice movement... We should remind the country that AHINDA is not a vote bank, but it is the voice of India’s conscience.”\nAttacking the BJP and Sangha Parivar, the Chief Minister said, “They may polarise India through caste division, but we will win back India through social unity and constitutional justice. They treat OBCs as mere symbols, We uplift them as equals.”  At every step, BJP opposed Congress’s social justice efforts not just politically, but ideologically too, undermining equity and resisting OBC empowerment out of discomfort for true backward class advancement, he added.\nAmong those present in the meeting, which will continue its deliberations on Wednesday, were Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanswamy. The council will deliberate on the national caste census, a demand by the Congress and OBC oriented welfare programmes in the country."

The protest is to highlight the DMK government’s failure to implement 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Incidentally, Dr. Ramadoss’s residence is located at Thailapuram in Villupuram district.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, sources close to Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani  said fatigue had set in among the party cadre because of the feud, and this could affect the party’s performance in the 2026 Assembly election.\n“However, the protest against the DMK government would be huge. In 1995, Dr. Ramadoss declared that the then DMK president, M.  Karunanidhi, would be the next Chief Minister and presented him with a yellow shawl at Villupuram. Thirty-five years later, his son Dr. Anbumani  will demand the ouster of the DMK and Karunanidhi’s son, M.K. Stalin, from power for their failure to implement the internal reservation for the Vanniyars,” PMK spokesperson K. Balu said.\nAnother senior PMK leader close to Dr. Ramadoss said he hoped Dr. Anbumani would step back. “Who is going to be the biggest loser if the party’s vote share dwindles and voters switch to other parties? It is going to be Dr. Anbumani who is the future of this party,” he said."

This was 1,579 cusecs higher than Monday’s release of 50,369 cusecs.\nFor the first time during this monsoon, Maharashtra released 5,500 cusecs of water from the Koyna dam into the river Krishna on Tuesday.\nThe dam authorities managing the inflow are trying to balance the impounded quantity of water. The dam recorded an inflow of 25,478 cusecs. The dam has 76.5 tmcft of water or 72% of the full reservoir level.\nOfficials are not impounding water in the Hipparagi barrage. The dam recorded an inflow of 50,460 cusecs and an outflow of 49,810 cusecs. As inflow is high in the Krishna, the river is in a free flow state, hence storage is not done in the monsoon period, officers said in a release.\nThe Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir on the Krishna at Almatti recorded an inflow of 42,577 cusecs and an outflow of 25,000 cusecs.\nThe dam has 97.13 tmcft of water or 78.92% of the full reservoir level.\nThe Narayanpur dam recorded an inflow of 25,000 cusecs and an outflow of 3,000 cusecs. The dam has 30 tmcft of water or 90% of the full capacity."

Besides there would be biannual review meetings, annual reports, and a real-time data dashboard and the field sites will be spread across over 15 forest divisions and protected areas in southern Karnataka.\n“Modern technology will be used to protect elephant corridors and habitats in order to control the increasing elephant-human conflict in the State and protect the crops of farmers on the edge of the forest areas,” said Environment Minister Eshwar Khandre.\nHe further said that elephant-human conflict is common in Hassan and Kodagu, causing loss of life and crop damage, and the department is taking all possible steps to control it."

    "content": "To tap into the expertise of retired scientists, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) — the newly constituted body for funding scientific research — has announced the Prime Minister Professorships.\nEach selected Professor will receive an annual fellowship of ₹30 lakh, along with ₹24 lakh as a research grant for consumables, domestic travel, contingencies, equipment and other expenses. An overhead of ₹1 lakh per annum has also been provisioned.\nThe Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), now subsumed under the ANRF, had earlier administered the SERB Distinguished Fellowship for retired scientists. That scheme offered a research grant of ₹20 lakh per annum and a monthly fellowship of ₹60,000.\nUnlike previous fellowships, the new initiative is also open to overseas scientists, including Non-Resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin, and Overseas Citizens of India. Additionally, professionals from industry and experienced Professors of Practice with a “distinguished record” of research and innovation are eligible to apply.\nA key distinction of the new programme is that recipients must be based at State universities that qualify as “spoke” institutions under Category A of the recently introduced Promoting Advanced and Inclusive Research (PAIR) programme of the ANRF.\nThe PAIR initiative links universities with nascent research ecosystems to top-tier institutions in a mentorship arrangement. Select Central Universities, National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been classified as “spoke” institutions, while institutions ranked 25 or below in the National Institutional Ranking Framework are designated as “hubs”.\nThe selected Professors are expected to relocate, if necessary, to the host university and provide “sustained academic and research support to faculty and students in institutions with emerging research capacity”.\n“Applicants with strong research credentials must be actively involved in research and innovation activities, and demonstrate a strong commitment to mentor faculty at the eligible State universities where research and innovation is still at a nascent stage,” stated a note from the ANRF announcing the fellowship."

    "content": "ThePahalgam terrorist attackof April 22 was carried out to hurt theJammu and Kashmireconomy and to “sow a religious divide”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (SCO-CFM) meeting in China, where other SCO Ministers — including Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar — were present, and called for support to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nOn Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Jaishankar and the other SCO Ministers from Russia, Iran, Belarus and Central Asian states called on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) before proceeding to the SCO meeting in Tianjin by train. The External Affairs Minister also held bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, both of whom he met earlier this month at the BRICS summit in Brazil.\nMr. Jaishankar’s comments came a month after the SCO Defence Ministers’ meeting failed to issue a joint statement following differences over the references to terrorism. While no statement was issued after the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting as well, officials said it was not the practice to do so, as the Foreign Ministers were normally tasked with finalising the agenda for the Summit of leaders on August 31-September 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Tianjin for the summit, which would be his first such visit since the Galwan clashes in 2020.\n“The three evils that SCO was founded to combat were terrorism, separatism and extremism,” Mr. Jaishankar said during his speech at the meeting, where he referred to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 men, mostly tourists, were religiously identified and killed. “It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide”, he added, calling for the SCO to take an “uncompromising position” on the challenge of terrorism, and referring to the UN Security Council resolution issued in April about the attack.\nA press statement issued by the SCO Secretariat said that the members “exchanged views on key areas of SCO cooperation, including political, economic, trade, cultural issues and key international and regional issues”, but did not specifically mention terrorism.\nMr. Jaishankar’s meeting with Mr. Xi came a day after he held bilateral talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he hailed the “continued normalisation” of India-China relations. The Minister said that he had apprised President Xi of recent developments in bilateral relations. “I value the guidance of our leaders in that regard”, he posted on X, referring to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi.\nChinese state media reported that Mr. Xi had told SCO Ministers that the organisation must play a “more proactive role” to ensure stability in a “turbulent and changing international landscape”. Most SCO countries, especially China and India, would be affected if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned law imposing 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil and sanctioned products.\nIn his comments during the SCO-CFM, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mr. Dar did not refer to the issue of terrorism. In a post on social media, Mr. Dar said that he “underscored the importance of upholding international law and implementing relevant UNSC resolutions to resolve longstanding disputes”, at the meeting and that Pakistan sought peace with “all its neighbours”.\nReferring to Afghanistan, which is an SCO observer state but has not been invited since 2021 when the Taliban regime took control of Kabul, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “compulsions of regional stability are buttressed by [India’s] longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people” and called for SCO members to increase development assistance.\nTaking a swipe at Pakistan for closing transit for India-Afghanistan trade, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “lack of assured transit within the SCO space…undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas”, and advocated for the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that runs through Iran."

Usha Raja Nanthini, Professor and Head, Biotechnology Department, has filed 150 separate applications under industrial design for jewellery made with naturally-occurring seeds. The project, funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), aims to train the tribespeople in jewellery-making and help them market their products through a website.\nFive tribal women have come together to establish a company, Tulir, and registered it as a micro, small and medium enterprise. The website is being designed and will sell honey, nutmeg, lichens, benzoin resin (sambrani), and myrobalan (kadukkai), besides jewellery.\nMs. Usha said, “They live in 15-20 hamlets spread over Palani Hills and their population according to the 2011 Census was around 6,000. The children rarely go to school and they live a simple life collecting non-timber forest produce.”\nWhile being on a project to analyse different species of eucalyptus for anti-fungal properties, Ms. Usha and her team came across this habitation. Seeds of eucalyptus, adenanthera, coix and corymbia found in the area were colourful and tough, and they came in various sizes and shapes. “An idea sparked: if we designed jewellery and taught them how to make them, they could sell the products for a living.”\nA few prototypes of the jewellery designs were submitted to the TNSCST in August 2023 and the Council approved the project in January 2024. Then began the tough task of bringing the villagers together. “They were shy and would not entertain outsiders. So, we went through the tribal headman who helped us getting a few people,” Ms. Usha elaborated.\nThe training for the villagers began in January, and she filed the IPR applications through the IPR cell set up by the Council at the university in March. “The idea of setting up these cells is to protect our intellectual property and use them for the benefit of the people,” said S. Vincent, Member Secretary, TNSCST. The council has already set up 40 such cells.\nFifty villagers from Pethuparai Bharathi Annanagar and Pallangi-Kombai hamlets have been trained in jewellery-making, Ms. Usha said. As an aside, members of a women’s self help group from Vadakounji and Vadajaraparai were trained in apiculture (beekeeping), in collaboration with sisters from Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI).\nThe people living in these hamlets largely belonged to the Pazhiyar and Puliyar tribes and have been eking out a living, collecting lichens, soap nuts, gooseberry, honey and other non-timber forest produce and selling them to intermediaries for a pittance, Ms. Usha said. “The place is so remote that the nearest bus stop is 29 kilometres away. Very few have studied till high school,” she added."

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said. The SIR should not be about verifying citizenship, which is the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.\nThe SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar showed the poll panel had admitted to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party, had been saying — that there was a problem with the electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.\n“If Rahul Gandhi is right, then the ECI should give the Congress the data it has been asking for. First, they should accept this, and then adopt the right method to rectify it,” he said.\n“If they have to revise, it should be done with transparency and given proper time. What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

Bindu calling for discussions on marks  processes and development of tools for the same.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the KHSTU said decisions taken without any discussions on such grave issues as normalisation had led to change in candidates’ ranks, putting students under immense stress and resulting in setbacks in courts. This created wrong precedent and allowed mistakes to continue, the association alleged.\nThe government should organise discussions and deliberation instead of taking unilateral decisions so that apprehensions of State higher secondary students’ who were unfairly disadvantaged could be addressed."

After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\nAlso Read |IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw showcases new Aadhaar app for instant authentication\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

He made the appeal during a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday, as part of his two-day visit to the national capital.\nMr. Naidu was accompanied by Union Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, Minister of State for Rural Development Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, TDP Lok Sabha floor leader Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and others.\nThe Chief Minister explained that the project aims to divert 200 tmc ft of surplus floodwaters from the Polavaram reservoir to the Banakacherla regulator in Kurnool district. This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema. Later, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Managing Director Vikas Kumar also called on the Chief Minister and held discussions on possible collaboration for metro rail projects in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada."

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

The belief that these cases are occurring only in Hassan is incorrect.”\nInstead of panicking, people should focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, getting adequate sleep, and exercising regularly. “Only those having symptoms of heart-related illness should go for a medical check-up. Do not rush to hospitals without a reason,” Dr. Patil said.\nThe Minister further noted that lifestyle changes after COVID-19 have led to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. “Dietary habits have changed, and stress levels have increased. We are studying the reasons behind the rise in deaths among the youth,” he said."

    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”\nSome auto aggregators have already started displaying the revised minimum fare of ₹36. A leading aggregator has adopted the new fare even before its official implementation on August 1."

Yet, Mr. Vikramarka had made ‘false statements’ which are ‘defamatory in nature’ with a ‘preconceived motive to tarnish the fame and reputation’ of the BJP leader, said the notice.\nCondemning the Deputy CM’s statements, the notice said it has caused ‘irreversible’ damage to the Telangana BJP president’s reputation.

Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

A look at such symbols with the size in which they are displayed on ballot papers/EVM machines clearly show the similarities of the free symbols with the BRS symbol of car.\nIt could be clearly understood as to how candidates getting those symbols had been cutting into BRS votes in the past, affecting the prospects of BRS candidates.

To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933.

Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered.

We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre-matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

    "content": "The police have arrested four people, including three habitual offenders from Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly making a ransom call to a city businessman posing as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi last week.\nThe suspects have been identified as Rafiq, a Bengaluru businessman, and Amith, Vansh Sachdev, and Sheeshpal Singh, alias Monty, all from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.\nOn July 8, one of the suspects from U.P. called a Bengaluru businessman claiming to be Bishnoi, and threatened to kidnap his son and demanded ₹1 crore. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

    "content": "After a brief hiatus, the southwest monsoon conditions have strengthened across the State with the intensification of monsoon flow of wind from the Arabian Sea. North and central Kerala will have some intense spells of rain compared to the rest of State for the next week, with spillover rain even benefitting parts of south Kerala.\nThe peak monsoon feature offshore trough, which was in a feeble condition, has now turned into active mode with the trough extending from the Gujarat coast to the south Kerala coast on Tuesday. The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe current spell is likely to bridge the shortfall of July rain over the State, with the north half of Kerala having the lion’s share of rain, including parts of central Kerala. However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

Ramchander Rao for his remarks on the inclusion of Muslims in the Backward Classes (BC) category in the State. He claimed that poor Muslims were first included in the BC category during the British period, adding that Muslims were part of the BCs even in BJP-ruled states.\nSpeaking to the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Tuesday, the Congress MP advised Mr. Ramchander Rao to gain subject knowledge before making such comments. “Ramchander Rao lacks substance, that’s why he is resorting to babbling. It would be better if he gained knowledge on the subject before commenting,” he said.\nMr. Kiran Kumar also alleged that the BJP was attempting to divide people along religious and caste lines. “I hope that at least Ramchander Rao should not do the same thing,” he said, appealing to the BJP for cooperation in the State’s development. He reiterated the Congress government’s commitment to implementing 42% reservations for BCs."

Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment. Later that day, he took the drastic step.\nRamakanth was shifted to a private hospital in Bahadurpally, where he was declared dead.

Anil Kumar from using his official vehicle on Tuesday.\nDr. Kunnummal has issued instructions to Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen, who has been given additional charge of Registrar, and the security wing to implement the order. However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

However, he was informed only a couple of days before the event. By then, his visit to Indi in Vijayapura was already scheduled.\n“The BJP leaders thought that the Chief Minister would speak about the tax collection and the dues from the Centre. To avoid embarrassment, they did not invite him in advance. MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi planned and executed the programme,” he remarked.\nHe maintained that the State government had been taking up many development works for the State, including the Sharavati Pumped Storage project. “It intends to generate 2,000 MW of power. The Central government has also given its consent for the project, which is being executed at a cost of ₹8,644 crore,” he said.\nRegarding the opposition to the project, Mr. Krishna said that the opposition from environmentalists was expected. However, the project would not disturb the local habitats to a large extent. A few families, which would be affected, had been convinced. The government would consider their demands, including jobs, with the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, he added."

    "content": "The rulingNational Conference (NC)on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) upped the ante against Jammu and Kashmir Governor Manoj Sinha, with Chief MinisterOmar Abdullahsaying he “suffered silently for the past eight months”.\n“We suffered in silence for the past eight months but did not complain. It’s for what happened yesterday that you (people) came to know about our reality. But don’t misconstrue our decency for weakness. We don’t talk loudly, threaten or resort togundagardi(hooliganism) but that does not mean we are weak. My strength is my people. I will always safeguard my strength,” Mr. Abdullah, who was addressing a function at the Jhelum Valley Medical College in Srinagar, said.\nMr. Abdullah was referring to the L-G administration’s security measures to stop the Chief Minister and the Ministers from visiting the graveyard where 22 civilians, killed during the 1931 uprising against the Dogra ruler, are buried. On July 14, there were dramatic images where Mr. Abdullah was seen climbing a wall to reach the graveyard and a police officer pushing him in a bid to stop him from paying tributes.\n“They (administration) tried their best to raise barricades on July 14. No barricade will push us away from our goal. We will work towards realising the dignity and dreams of people of Kashmir. There will be no sell out with the dreams of our people. It’s no favour we are ruling Jammu and Kashmir. It’s because of Allah and our people we are here today,” Mr. Abdullah said.\nIt’s for the first time since Mr. Abdullah won elections in October 2024 after a prolonged Central rule that he upped the ante to this high pitch against L-G Mr. Sinha, who retains the powers to transfer employees, both State and Central services, and spearhead the security forces in the union territory.\nThe dramatic images of Mr. Abdullah being heckled and disallowed to reach the graveyard in Srinagar evoked sharp reactions from national leaders, includingTamil NaduChief Minister M.K. Stalin,West BengalChief Minister Mamata Banerjee,Samajwadi Partypresident Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav.\n“At a time when there is a growing demand for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood, the current events unfolding there are a grim reminder of how far things have deteriorated. If this can happen in Kashmir, it can happen anywhere, to any elected representative of the people. Every democratic voice must unequivocally condemn this,” Mr. Stalin said in a post on X.\nMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) described the actions against the sitting Chief Minister as “an insult to democracy”.\n“This land saw countless sacrifices for freedom and the Constitution. Under the same Constitution, Mr. Abdullah’s government was elected by the people. Any insult to Mr. Abdullah is an insult to democracy, an insult to India’s democracy, and an insult to the people who gave us their mandate,” said Mr. Choudhary.\nMr. Choudhary said any insult or humiliation of our leader would not be tolerated. “We will not stay silent. What happened yesterday whether people speak up about it or not is an insult to every Indian who cast their vote,” he added.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister said one day the L-G, like taking responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack, might even say that what happened with OmarSahibwas wrong. “The police are under his control and acted unjustly. He (L-G) owes an apology for what happened yesterday,” he added.\nReferring to Mr. Sinha’s recent statement accepting responsibility for the security lapse in the Pahalgam terror attack, Mr. Abdullah said, “Someone has to be held responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack and now that the security lapses have been accepted.”"

    "content": "A sense of fear gripped Shalivahana Nagar, a residential colony in Malakpet here after gunfire shattered the early morning calm on Tuesday. The incident was reported around 7:20 a.m., just outside Shalivahana Nagar Park, where Communist Party of India (CPI) State Council member Chandu Naik, 47, was shot dead during morning walk.\nThe park, located at the end of a wide lane flanked by swanky independent houses and residential complexes, akiranastore, an Urban Primary Health Centre and many trees, turned into a scene of panic as the attackers allegedly fired five rounds at Naik from close range before fleeing in a car.\nOutside the park’s ‘West Gate’, police from the South East Zone cordoned off an area roughly the size of a human body, with a white chalk outlining the boundaries of the body. At its centre lay a large bloodstain.\nVijay Kumar (name changed on request), a local resident whose house faces the park, said: “I heard what sounded like firecrackers. I rushed out immediately and saw four men escaping in a white car after shooting Naik multiple times. They stood over him briefly to confirm he was dead, then drove away via the four-way junction to the left of the park.”\nThe road in front of the park, to Kumar’s residence, is wide enough for three SUVs to pass at a time. It was the same stretch the assailants used to speed away in their getaway vehicle, a hatchback, that they had rented from a nearby place.\nChandu Naik.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Arrangement\nKumar’s two children, aged 12 and 13, were coming downstairs to leave for school when the shots rang out. “They were terrified and ran back inside. It took some time to calm them down. I eventually had to escort them to their school van myself,” he added.\nHe also pointed out that Naik’s body remained at the spot for over half an hour before the police arrived. Despite the Urban Primary Health Centre being just a few steps away, the body was not moved.\nAnother resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “At first, we thought it was just kids shooting videos in the park again. But the gunshots continued. Minutes later, we saw a body in a pool of blood.” Like many others in the locality, he expressed concern for his safety and said he no longer felt secure taking his morning walk.\nAnil (name changed), who owns a kirana store about 100 metres from the site, said he opened his shop shortly after the attack. “People kept coming in, asking what the sounds were and what had happened. The whole area was in a state of shock,” he said.\nPolice officers at the crime scene.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                NAGARA GOPAL\nBy mid-morning, the lane was swarming with police patrol vehicles, and officers clad in khaki moved briskly across the colony, speaking to residents and scouring the area for clues. The park, which bustles with activity until 10 a.m., was deserted. Access was blocked as police launched an investigation into the shooting.\nMalakpet ACP K.Subba Rami Reddy stated that Naik had been accompanied to the park by his wife and daughter, who had left shortly before the attack. “Around 7.20 a.m., as Naik was walking back towards his car, four men got out of another vehicle and attacked him. One threw chilli powder into his eyes while the others shot him from point-blank range using a country-made pistol,” Mr.Reddy said."

Some ₹3.08 crore was sanctioned to the Karnataka Gramin Bank to develop connectivity infrastructure in underserved areas.\nNABARD released a booklet titled ‘Success Stories of FPOs in Karnataka’, which documented the inspiring journeys of farmer-producer organisations across the State. The booklet showcases how small and marginal farmers have successfully come together to access markets, add value to their produce, embrace digital platforms, and establish inclusive and resilient business models.\nNABARD has played a key role in supporting sustainable agriculture, developing secondary agriculture, creating value addition and in the development of rural infrastructure in Karnataka, acknowledged Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, she urged farmers in the State to make full use of NABARD’s schemes and become entrepreneurs.\nElaborating on value addition, the Chief Secretary said, instead of selling mangoes as raw produce, farmers should process them into various products and sell them. Recently, the price of Totapuri mango variety crashed, and if mango farmers set up small processing units in their villages, they would be able to earn income round the year, she said."

    "content": "Opposition leaders in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday came out in support of a teacher from Bareilly, who was booked under Section 353 (2) (making statements containing false information, rumour or alarming news) of the BNS for his poem, parts of which referred to the Kanwar Yatra.\nThe FIR against Rajneesh Gangwar, a teacher at Bareilly’s MGM Inter College, was registered on July 13, based on a complaint by an outfit named Kanwar Seva Samiti.\nThe video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, which recently went viral on social media, contains a portion where he says, “Kanwar leke mat jana, tum gyan ka deep jalana, manavta ke seva karke tum sachche manav ban jaana[Don’t get pots of holy water from the Ganga, light the lamp of knowledge, become a true human by serving humanity].”\nSharing the video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, former U.P. Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X in Hindi, “The greatest religion is that which leads us on the path of humanity.”\nAttacking the ruling BJP, Congress leader Anil Yadav said that while the Constitution promotes scientific thinking, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry among citizens, which Mr. Gangwar was trying to promote through his verse, elements in the State government aim to encourage “superstition and irrationality and suppress voices”.\nMeanwhile, in a purported video on Tuesday, Mr. Gangwar said his poem was meant to educate students, and his intention was not to express negative sentiments about the yatra. “If you listen to the whole poem, it was recited to educate children and tell them about incidents happening related tokanwariyas.”\nHe also dared the police to take action against senior National Democratic Alliance(NDA)leader and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president O.P. Rajbhar over his purported comments from 2021: “No one can become a doctor or an engineer from among thekanwariyas. Kanwar Yatra is meant only for unemployed people.” At the time, Mr. Rajbhar, an MLA from Zahoorabad, was part of the Opposition. He joined the ruling NDA in 2023 and is currently a Minister in the State Cabinet."

It called reports on media and commentary on social media as “hasty”.\n“A preliminary report is merely the means of communication used for the prompt dissemination of data obtained during the early stages of the investigation and only contains factual information and an indication of the progress of the investigation,” the statement added.\nAmid demands from pilot bodies for allowing them observer status during the ongoing probe, IFALPA said it was “committed” to supporting the AAIB."

Appadurai, Head of Department, Department of Dental Surgery, Vellore Medical College Hospital; K. Baby John, Dean, Vinayaka Mission Hospital (Salem); and B. Vijay, principal, RVS Dental College and Hospital (Coimbatore).\nThe inspection was led by Mr. Appadurai and the other two were members of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Council. “The dental clinic has remained closed since it was sealed from May 31 on orders of Tirupattur Collector K. Siva Soundaravalli. Action against the clinic will be taken based on the report of the team,”, V. Gnana Meenakshi, Joint Director of Health Services (JDHS), Tirupattur, toldThe Hindu.\nThe team inspected various sections in the clinic. The hour-long inspection also involved interaction with doctors, nurses, and other staff, who worked in the clinic before its closure. As the team completed the inspection, health authorities closed and sealed the facility.\nHealth officials said that closure of the clinic comes in the wake of a study done jointly by CMC Vellore, ICMR-NIE and Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health, which stated that an unsterile surgical instrument was used to open a saline bottle at the clinic. Reuse of the bottle’s contents had led to at least 10 people contracting neuro melioidosis — a bacterial infection of the brain — which allegedly led to the death of eight patients, who got treated there, the study said."

A magistrate’s court had found them guilty and handed down the sentence on June 18.\nThe convicts also included an unsuccessful Congress candidate in the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election. All of them convicted under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), and 341 (wrongful restraint) of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment each, along with the imposition of fine of ₹3,200 each.\nAmong the convicts, Abhishek Chaudhary contested the 2023 Assembly election as a Congress candidate from Jaipur’s Jhotwara constituency and lost. The other convicts in the case were Rajesh Meena, Ravi Kirad, Wasim Khan, Dron Yadav, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Vidyadhar Meel.\nAdditional Sessions Judge Prem Ratan Ojha accepted the contention of the appellants that they would be deprived of their legal rights if the sentence was not suspended. The court granted relief to the convicts and posted the case for further hearing on August 26.\nThe Assembly membership of both Mr. Bhakar and Mr. Yadav remains unaffected following the sentencing, as a legislator can be disqualified only on being convicted for an offence with a two-year sentence or more, as per Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."

So, there is great potential for innovation, he observed after inaugurating IBM’s Ecosystem Incubation Center (EIC) at Infopark Kochi. The EIC has been conceived as a strategic space designed to accelerate innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration across start-ups, enterprises, and academia, while serving as a hub for early-stage ventures, skill-building, and co-innovation.\nEmphasising the need for a “clear understanding and consultation” ahead of introducing AI in the government’s daily operations, Mr. Rajeeve said its implementation would not compromise on privacy and data security. “This kind of a change will be very beneficial to the people,” he pointed out.\nThe Minister recalled that the government had prepared a draft proposal called ‘Industry 4.0’ for the introduction of AI in the industrial sector. “We will take a decision on this after receiving feedback from the industry,” he added.\nKerala has 16 colleges that have made it to the top 100 colleges in the country. Three universities are in the top 20, the Minister pointed out. Mr. Rajeeve also inaugurated a symposium ‘GenAI and Agentic AI for start-ups, academia, and enterprises’.\nIBM Software senior vice president Dinesh Nirmal said Kerala enjoyed an advantage in the availability of skills and operational excellence. The State’s transport connectivity is “excellent” compared to other places, he said, noting that the incubation centre was started to “fully utilise the excellent IT ecosystem” in Kerala.\n“By collaborating with organisations such as the Kerala Startup Mission, Infopark, Technopark, and the academia, we aim to scale the development of impactful software solutions to solve our clients’ hybrid cloud and AI needs,” he added.\nPrincipal Secretary (Industries) A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, KSIDC Managing Director Mir Mohammed Ali, IBM India vice president Vishal Chahal, Infopark CEO Susanth Kurunthil, and representatives of industry associations attended the event."

Hatred in politics spares no one.

    "content": "Though Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in April that ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) had been restored, there has been no attempt by either party to conceal the apparent contradictions between them.\nAt a press conference held jointly with the AIADMK general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Shah said, “We will fight the elections under the leadership of Edappadiji.” He also added that there would be a “coalition government” in the event of a victory. The AIADMK did not react positively to this announcement. It is not just the AIADMK; even the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has always been averse to the idea of a coalition government in Tamil Nadu.\nIn the 1980 Assembly elections, the DMK-Congress combine failed to capture power. The constituents of the coalition contested an equal number of seats. After a round of wrangling with the DMK, the Congress finally agreed that the then DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate. However, the coalition did not click at the hustings. Instead, the AIADMK, which won only two seats in the Lok Sabha elections earlier that year and subsequently lost power in Tamil Nadu, staged a spectacular comeback in the Assembly polls.\nIn 2001, when the AIADMK contested the Assembly elections from 141 seats — the lowest number it has ever contested — in view of coalition compulsion, political circles discussed whether the party would be able to obtain a simple majority of its own. The AIADMK needed to secure 118 seats in the House of 234. The AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa never favoured the concept of sharing power in the State. However, the party had no reason to worry as it won 132 seats.\nIn 2006, the DMK fell short of a simple majority as it won only 96 seats. Yet, it refused to share power with its allies. Karunanidhi and the then Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, shared such a good rapport that the DMK patriarch managed to form the government without sharing power with the Congress.\nAfter making that comment in April, Mr. Shah reiterated his position in many interviews to the media. However, the AIADMK is clearly not on the same page. Alluding to the Union Minister’s stand, AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan said that the concept of a coalition government would “never ever” find acceptance among the people of the State. Similarly, Mr. Palaniswami, who launched a State-wide tour from July 7 in the run-up to the 2026 Assembly elections, has been asserting that the AIADMK will form the government after gaining a majority on its own. When asked to comment on Mr. Shah’s position, he said he interpreted them as an endorsement of single-party rule in the State. Despite the conflicting views of the two parties, the BJP State president, Nainar Nagendran, and Union Minister of State L. Murugan participated in Mr. Palaniswami’s campaign launch.\nIn one interview, Mr. Shah said that the nominee for the post of Chief Minister would be from the AIADMK; he did not mention Mr. Palaniswami’s name. This did not go unnoticed in the DMK circles. The party sought to corner the AIADMK general secretary and saw Mr. Shah’s statement as a lack of confidence in Mr. Palaniswami’s leadership qualities. Eventually, it was left to Mr. Nagendran to clarify that the AIADMK leader would head the government.\nYet, speculation is rife that the Union Minister may have in mind former Municipal Administration Minister in Coimbatore, S.P. Velumani. About three weeks ago, the AIADMK strongman shared the stage with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior BJP leaders at the birth centenary celebration of the pontiff of Perur Mutt, Shanthalinga Ramasamy Adigalar. He later explained that he attended the event, which he termed as “apolitical”, only as a local legislator. Prior to the announcement on the tie up between the two parties, there were reports of differences of opinion between the AIADMK chief and some of his senior colleagues, including Mr. Velumani.\nAs the debate over the nature of government could spoil the narrative for the Opposition parties, it would be in the interest of the alliance to sort out the issue soon. Having said that, it remains inexplicable that this debate is even raging given that the composition of different alliances has not even been finalised yet."

    "content": "Jiten Gohain is the head of one of 218 families evicted during a drive the authorities in Assam’s Lakhimpur district carried out on July 3 to reclaim 78 acres of Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) land across four locations.\nOn July 8, the district’s Sub-Divisional Land Advisory Committee approved the allotment of 1.5 kathas (4,320 sq. ft) of land each to 21 families evicted, in one of the fastest such exercises. Among them were 12 belonging to the Ahom community, which is seeking Scheduled Tribe status, to which Mr. Gohain belongs.\nDistrict Commissioner Pronab Jit Kakoty said the eviction drive was conducted following “due process”. He said the affected families, which failed to produce land ownership documents, were served notices on June 29.\n“I had a larger plot from where we were evicted, but the government has at least provided some space,” Mr. Gohain said.\nAbul Hasan Sheikh, one of some 200-odd Bengali-speaking Muslim families evicted from Lakhimpur, is not sure if the government would be equally “generous” to provide him an alternative plot. He is originally a resident of western Assam’s South Salmara-Mankachar district along the border with Bangladesh.\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma named him and at least a dozen others from faraway districts – most of them Muslim-majority – to underline the alleged “agenda of demographic invasion by strategically occupying lands in areas dominated by indigenous communities”.\n“An analysis has revealed that the families evicted from Lakhimpur included 76 from Barpeta, 63 from Nagaon, seven from Goalpara, and two from South Salmara-Mankachar. Why should someone from South Salmara go to Lakhimpur instead of going to West Bengal, about 50 km away?” Mr. Sarma told reporters on Tuesday.\nThe Chief Minister said more than 50,000 people have been evicted from “protected areas, wetlands, VGR and PGR (Professional Grazing Land), government khas (land owned by the government that has not been settled) and wasteland, and those belonging tosatras (Vaishnav monasteries) andnamghars (prayer halls)” over the past few weeks.\nAccording to the State’s Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation of 1986, the Land Policy of 1989, and a 2011 Supreme Court judgment mandate protection of government and village common lands. It also cites the violation of the Assam Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act of 2010 as a punishable offence.\nAfter the BJP came to power in Assam in May 2016, the first eviction drive was carried out in three fringe villages of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. Two persons, including a minor girl, were killed during the eviction based on a Gauhati High Court order in September 2016.\n“Most of those evicted are listed as voters in places from where they came. We have asked the authorities from where they were evicted to delete their names from the electoral rolls to eliminate duplicate names,” Mr. Sarma said.\nCiting the case of the 12 Ahom families, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union has demanded rehabilitation for the evicted Muslim families. It claimed many people had lands they were evicted from before these were declared as reserve forests.\nThe Opposition parties have criticised the eviction drive for disproportionately targeting the minority communities. “The Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission should take note of the eviction during the court holidays in Assam to target poor Muslims. The government must first provide adequate rehabilitation and only then undertake eviction,” All India United Democratic Front MLA Rafiqul Islam said.\n“The BJP government has been projecting the evicted people as Bangladeshi. The government provided a compensation package of ₹14.72 crore to 332 families evicted from Kaziranga. People evicted [in 2021] for the Gorukhuti project [Darrang district] were compensated and given land in the Dalgaon area. Why is the government doing so if these people are Bangladeshi?” Congress leader and advocate Aman Wadud said.\nOthers pointed out that the Dhubri district administration has asked 1,400 families displaced from Chapar town, reportedly to make space for a thermal power plant by the Adani Group, to relocate to a sandbar in the middle of the Brahmaputra river.\n“The eviction is being carried out for two reasons. Firstly, they want to clear land for corporate houses. Secondly, evicting minorities paves the way for the politics of polarisation... so that the Hindu voters back the BJP, especially in eastern Assam, where it is facing challenges,” Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi said.\nLurinjyoti Gogoi, the chief of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), said eviction drives are a form of the tried-and-tested ploy of weaponising the “Bangladeshi issue” before the poll.\nThe Assembly poll in Assam is due by May 2026.\n“The Chief Minister claims he is doing everything for the indigenous people. In reality, more tribal families have been evicted than the Muslims. In Karbi Anglong, 20,000 Adivasi, Karbi, and Naga families have been evicted to hand over 18,000 bighas of land to the Reliance Group,” the AJP leader claimed. In Assam, one bigha is equivalent to 14,400 sq. ft.\nHe also cited 9,000 bighas of land “to be handed over to the Adani Group” in Dima Hasao district, 45 bighas “taken away” from the Adivasis for a hotel project near Kaziranga, and 75 bighas for a Patanjali project in the Golaghat district. “It is evident why the government is on a land acquisition spree. Of the 49,000 bighas cleared, only 6,000 bighas were under the occupation of the religious minorities,” the AJP leader said."

    "content": "The history section of the newly introduced Class 8 social science textbook by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for students in the current 2025-26 academic year portrays Mughal rulers, especially Babur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb, as “intellectuals” who also “plundered” the Indian population.\nThe second chapter of the textbook, titled ‘Reshaping India’s Political Map in Theme B - Tapestry of the Past’ includes references from theBaburnama, Babur’s autobiography, and describes him as cultured, intellectually curious, and having a keen appreciation of architecture, poetry, flora, and fauna. The textbook also goes on to say that Babur was a ruthless conqueror, slaughtering populations, enslaving women and children, and taking pride in erecting “towers of skulls” in plundered cities.\nAkbar’s reign is described as a blend of “brutality and tolerance”, and that during the seizure of the Chittor fort, Akbar, then 25 years old, ordered the massacre of 30,000 civilians, and the enslavement of women and children, the new textbook states. Akbar’s message is also quote in the textbook: “We have succeeded in occupying a number of forts and towns belonging to infidels and have established Islam there. With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” The textbook says Akbar leaned towards peace in the later years of his reign.\nThe new textbook also states that Aurangzeb issuedfarmansor edicts to demolish schools and temples. “Temples at Banaras, Mathura, Somnath among many others were destroyed, as well as Jain temples and Sikh gurdwaras,” the new textbook says. It also speaks of the persecution of Sufis and Zoroastrians at the hands of the Mughals.\nBabur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb have not been described in such detail in the older NCERT textbook’s chapter on the Mughals, which appeared in the Class 7 History book (‘Our Pasts II’).\nMichel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science. File\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu\n“Indian history cannot be cannot sanitised and presented as a smooth, happy development throughout. There were bright periods but also dark periods where people suffered, so we have given note on the darker chapters of history, and also given a disclaimer that no one today should be regarded as responsible for whatever happened in the past,” Michel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science, toldThe Hindu.\n“You cannot understand them (the Mughal emperors) unless you go into the complexities of their personalities. Akbar himself admits he was brutal in his younger days. We are not demonising Akbar or Aurangzeb, but we have to show these rulers had their limitations and committed cruel deeds,” Mr. Danino said.\nBecause Part One of the earlier released new Class 7 Social Science textbook in April culminated in the pre-Delhi Sultanate era of the 6th century, there was an element of uncertainty on how the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era would find their place in the newly revamped textbooks. While earlier a Class 7 student would have learnt about the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal history, these sections have now been shifted to the first part of the newly released Class 8 textbooks, available in bookstores mid-July onward.\nThe first part of the new Class 8 Social Science textbook, which has combined History, Geography, Civics, and Economics into one title,Exploring Society: India and Beyond, will serve as a resource for the first six months of the academic year for Class 8, NCERT officials clarified. “Part Two textbooks for both Classes 7 and 8 for Social Science will be released in October later this year. Part Two textbooks are currently under development,” officials said.\nThe new Class 8 textbook also has a section on heroic resistance to the Mughals, including on the Jat peasants who managed to kill a Mughal officer; the Bhil, Gond, Santhal and Koch tribal communities, who fought to protect their territories; and Rani Durgavati of one of the Gond kingdoms, who fought against Akbar’s army. Sections have also been added on the escape of Mewar’s ruler Maharana Pratap, and the resistance of the Ahoms to Aurangzeb’s army in northeastern India."

So there's all kinds of weapons, but we have not discussed in detail yesterday with the president.

Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to release water from the expanded Phase-1 canal of the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project on July 17, at the Malyala Pumping Station of Nandikotkur mandal in Nandyal district.\nThe expansion of HNSS Phase-1 canal had been completed, increasing its capacity from 2,200 cusecs to 3,850 cusecs, an official press release said here on Tuesday.\nThis canal was expected to facilitate the transfer of water up to the Jeedipalli Reservoir and beyond, with the government targeting the Chittoor and Punganur branch canals by the end of this month.\nThe expansion, taken up at a cost of ₹696 crore, would enable an additional 1,600 cusecs of water to be carried through the canal network. Officials said the project aimed at addressing the drinking water and irrigation needs of Rayalaseema, covering parts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Chittoor, and Kadapa districts.\nWater from the canal would benefit 6 lakh acres and provide drinking water to approximately 33 lakh people once Phase-1 and Phase-2 become fully operational. Under Phase-1, around 2,906 acres in Nandyal, 77,094 acres in Kurnool, and 1.18 lakh acres in Anantapur were set to receive irrigation supply. Phase-2 was projected to serve 2.27 lakh acres in Anantapur, 37,500 acres in Kadapa, and 1.40 lakh acres in Chittoor.\nThe release also mentioned that the government mobilised efforts to complete 216-km of canal works from Malyala to Jeedipalli, and planned to refill local reservoirs like Jeedipalli, Krishnagiri, Pathikonda, and Gajuladinne. The improved canal capacity was expected to allow full utilisation of the project’s 40 tmc ft water allocation this year — reportedly for the first time in over a decade.\nThe Water Resources Department executed the works over a 100-day period beginning in April 2025. The government plans to complete the remaining Phase-2 works by this month-end and supply water to the tail-end ayacut areas in Punganur and Kuppam.\nA total expenditure of ₹3,890 crore had been earmarked for Phases 1 and 2 of the HNSS project, the release added."

It suggested to enforce statutory timelines and penalties for inaction or misconduct by EROs or District Election Officers (DEOs), empower the State election watch committees to function with observer status during roll revision, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to prevent local influence or partisan misuse and appoint a State-level Ombudsman under ECI to handle unresolved political grievances related to the electoral rolls.\nIt has also suggested the ECI to conduct targeted re-enrollment campaigns for migrant workers, tribal groups, elderly people, and homeless citizens, and permit temporary address declarations with basic documentation to prevent disenfranchisement of mobile populations."

He said the government had drafted officials of various departments to receive petitions when only a few months were left for the election. The scheme was aimed at deceiving the electorate into voting for the ruling DMK. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had been concerned only about his family since he entered office in 2021 and launched the scheme now. “Why didn’t he reach out to the people for so long,” he asked.\nUngaludan Stalinwas similar to the exercise undertaken by Mr. Stalin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the run-up to the 2021 election. What was the need for launching a similar exercise when he and his party men had already received petitions. It was nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the people, Mr. Palaniswami said. Furthermore, the initiative was nothing new. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had drafted all revenue officials to receive petitions from the people at their doorsteps. It had been copied and launched as a new scheme to get publicity, he said.\nMr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK government had failed in maintaining law and order. There was no safety for the people. Murders, murders for gain, dacoity, and crimes against women and children were the order of the day. Since the DMK assumed office in 2021, the State had witnessed more than 7,700 murders. Mineral wealth was being looted by the government. A farmer was murdered and another sustained grievous injuries in an assault by the sand mafia in the Manmangalam taluk of Karur district on July 13, he alleged, urging the people to vote out the DMK.\nEarlier, interacting with farmers and representatives of farmers’ associations in Ariyalur district, he said the AIADMK government had provided three-phase power supply to the farmers throughout the day. However, it was stopped by the DMK government. The DMK government had discontinued several other schemes meant for helping the farmers improve productivity. The AIADMK government had provided subsidies to the farmers to buy modern agricultural machines. To prevent malpractices, applications were received online for the selection of beneficiaries. This practice had been halted and only hand-picked farmers were being given the benefits. All the schemes introduced by the AIADMK government for the benefit of farmers would be revived once the party returned to power, he said."

Everyone respected him a lot,\" the villager added.\nAnother local Gurpreet Singh said after the vehicle struck Fauja Singh, he was immediately rushed to hospital.\n\"We took him to hospital... The vehicle which struck him could be an SUV. He suffered injuries to head and other parts of body. Entire village has plunged into sadness after his demise. Our village got global recognition due to him,\" Mr. Gurpreet said.\nOn Tuesday, the Jalandhar police said that efforts are on to trace the erring driver, who had fled after the incident.\nThe last rites of Singh are likely to be conducted after a couple of days, a family member toldPTIon Tuesday.\n\"We have many relatives living abroad including in the U.K. and Canada. So, it may take some time before they reach,\" he said.\nHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said the news of Fauza Singh's demise is deeply saddening.\n\"Living a healthy lifestyle and reaching the age of 114, which seems impossible in today's era, he made possible,\" said Mr. Saini in a post in Hindi on X.\n\"His indomitable energy and message of a healthy lifestyle are a source of inspiration for us all.

Punjab and the world salute his incredible life,\" Bajwa posted on X.\nIn a post on X, Punjab Congress chief Warring wrote, \"Saddened over the untimely death of our legend #FaujaSingh Ji. He was an example of grit, determination and perseverance running marathons well past 100 years.\" \"More shocking is that he fell victim to a hit-and-run incident.

He became the first centenarian to complete a marathon, earning multiple records while participating in international events.\nHe went on to run marathons, including the famed ones in London, New York and Hong Kong, and inspire awe for clocking some brilliant timings for a 90-plus man born with weak legs.\nAmong the most memorable of his runs was in 2011 when he turned 100. The invitational meet in Toronto was named in his honour and he broke several world records for his age group.\nThe frail man, who weathered many personal storms with his resilience and \"nonchalance\", had spent a better part of his running career in Britain and returned to his roots just about three years ago after retiring.\nLast year, Singh, in a symbolic gesture, joined Punjab Governor Gulab Chand Kataria in a walkathon to spread awareness against drug abuse."

This news is extremely saddening,” she said, adding that Upendrakishore was a pillar of Bengal’s Renaissance.\nAccording to the Bangladesh Department of Archaeology, the house was built more than a century ago. After the partition of 1947, the property came under government ownership. Media reports in Bangladesh pointed out that the house has been left abandoned for ten years and a “Shishu Academy’ will be constructed in the place of the building.\nLast month, a political row erupted in West Bengal over theattack on an ancestral house of Rabindranath Tagoreat Sirajganj in Bangladesh, with both the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) highlighting the issue.\nWest Bengal Chief Minister on June 12 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him “take up the matter very strongly with the neighbouring country’s government, so that no stone is left unturned to swiftly bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous and mindless act”."

    "content": "The seemingly impeccably designed Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE), which was once the State’s single window system of intake of students to professional courses like engineering, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary, agriculture and other allied ones, was not bereft of controversies and legal wrangles.\nIn 2004, Anna University, the nodal agency which was tasked with conducting the TNPCEE on behalf of the State government since its inception in 1984, decided to not value 22 questions in different subjects. The break up went like this: seven out of 90 questions in Mathematics were omitted, three out of 60 questions in Physics, 10 out of 60 in Chemistry, and 2 out of 140 in Biology were not valued.\nIt all began when, soon after the exam, there were widespread complaints from candidates and their parents over ambiguity in the answer keys of some of the questions. They said some of the questions were out of syllabus, for some questions the answer keys were wrong and for some other questions, there were multiple correct answers. Anna University was quick to act: it set up an expert panel to evaluate the ambiguous questions and offer a solution. The committee advised deletion of these questions and redistribution of the marks for these questions to the other questions.\nAlso Read |How entrance examinations for professional courses made an entry into Tamil Nadu\nThis invited a flurry of court cases, which stalled the entire admission process for close to two months. Petitions contended these questions carried 8.8 marks and the entire merit list got exhausted within the range of 2-3 marks from the first candidate to the last one.\nSoon after the decision of Anna University was known regarding the ambiguous questions, scores of candidates approached the Madras High Court with various pleas, including setting up of an expert committee to find an acceptable solution and calling for re-examination. The cases were bunched together and heard by a single judge, Justice Prafulla Kumar Misra.\nAfter hearing senior counsels representing many of the candidates, Justice Misra directed Anna University to revalue all answer papers while laying down guidelines for valuing a few specific questions.\nAlso Read |Opposition to entrance tests dates back 3 decades\nJustice Misra’s order stated that “question numbers 27 and 33 in Biology question paper (version code MA-7) and question numbers 11, 64 and 77 of physical science (version code BS6) shall not be deleted and mark should be awarded to any student who has indicated any of the correct choices”. These questions were deleted on the ground that they had more than one correct answer.\nSimilarly, the judge ruled that question number 105 (MA-7) is to be revalued and option number 4 should be taken as the correct answer and not option number 3 as indicated by the committee. This question was: Highly concentrated mineral in the cerebro-spinal fluid is: (1) Pottasium, (2) Sodium, (3) Magnesium, (4) Chlorine.\nThe petitioners, the judgment said, contended that option 4 was the correct answer, which was also the option indicated by the paper setter as the correct answer. The expert committee, however, had suggested that option 3 was the correct answer.\nIn the counter affidavit by Anna University, the committee was stated to have opined that that chlorine being a gas in its natural form could not be considered as mineral and, even though Potassium and Sodium could be classified as minerals, those were not stable in free form and they react violently and become other compound; hence, the only other choice is Magnesium. They have referred to textbook P-239 in support of their opinion. “A perusal of the relevant pages as indicated makes it crystal clear that the question has been set by the paper setter with reference to the discussion relating to chlorine,” the judgment asserted.\nAlso Read |Tamil Nadu’s turbulent relationship with professional course entrance tests\nWhile some petitioners appealed against Justice Misra’s judgment, there were a few pending writ petitions before the High Court against considering improvement candidates on par with regular Plus Two students. All these petitions were bunched and placed before the First Bench comprising Justice Subhashan Reddy, the then Chief Justice of Madras High Court, and Justice Prabha Sridevan.\nAfter hearing both sides, the First Bench directed Anna University to revalue 11 of the questions that were not valued. It also came down heavily on Anna University for reviewing answer keys of paper setters by an expert committee. “The paper setter chooses questions from question bank where the key answers are already provided. By setting up the expert committee, the paper setter is reduced to just a clerk, as the key answer which is indicated has got absolutely no weightage as against the opinion of the expert committee as the University conducting the examination only takes note of the views of the expert committee for awarding marks. This practice has to be discontinued,” the order read.\nAnna University was directed to “take necessary steps to recompute and hold fresh counselling accordingly by including improvement candidates also”. The process of admission finally resumed on August 10 after nearly a two-month ordeal for the candidates and their parents."

    "content": "The experts of the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, have proposed a seawall along the Uppada coast in Kakinada district at a cost of ₹323 crore, recommending it as an immediate way to check the alarming speed of erosion.\nOn July 3, the NCCR experts began technical investigation along the Uppada coast in response to a request by Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan.\nMr. Pawan explained the NCCR experts about the challenges and displacement of the coastal communities due to erosion, which was on the rise since the geo-tube began to sweep away into the sea. The Kakinada-Uppada road, which leads towards Kakinada Special Economic Zone has also been damaged due to erosion.\nPrior to 2010, the 1.5 km-long geo-tube was installed along the Uppada coast. However, it could not withstand the giant waves, which dismantled the tube and ate into the fisherfolks habitations at Nemam, Ameenabad, Subbampeta, Komaragiri.\nAccording to the State Department of Survey, the Uppada coast has lost 1,360 acres of land since 2020 at the rate of 1.23 m per year and the maximum of 26.3 m of land had been lost to erosion during 2017-18.\nReferring to the NCCR’s proposal for the seawall, Kakinada MP Tangella Uday said, “The NCCR has proposed for a seawall with an estimated cost of ₹323 crore. On July 30, the proposal will be discussed by the National Disaster Management Authority in New Delhi. Secretary to Home Ministry Govind Mohan will chair the meeting.”\nIn 2021, the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS-Pune) has recommended a five-km seawall with a five-layer geomaterial to arrest the erosion along the Uppada coast, with an estimated cost of ₹176 crore."

    "content": "Former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj (1903-75), 122nd whose birth anniversary was celebrated on July 15, 2025 was known for organisational skills as well as fortifying the Congress in Tamil Nadu.\nIn his long career, he had shepherded the national party in the State so ably that the Congress won most of the electoral battles since 1946. Of course, in 1967 and 1971 Assembly polls, the limits of Kamaraj’s leadership qualities and electoral judgement came to the fore.\nThere were, however, two electoral contests - bye-elections to the Gudiyatham Assembly constituency in 1954 and to the Nagercoil (now called Kanniyakumari) Lok Sabha seat in 1969 - wherein he was a principal player and on both occasions, he achieved success with finesse. The two bye-elections had one common feature: both were held in regions outside his native district - Ramanathapuram, under which Virudhunagar [the place of his birth] fell between 1910 and 1985.\nThe need for contesting in the Gudiyatham bye-election arose for Kamaraj as he had to become a member of the legislature following his appointment as Chief Minister in April 1954. Even though the legislature of Tamil Nadu was bi-cameral then, Kamaraj did not choose to become a member of the Upper House (Legislative Council) unlike his predecessor C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji or CR) did in 1952. One of his successors C.N. Annadurai (CNA) used CR’s path in 1967. Also, there was a controversy over the way Rajaji became a Member of the Legislative Council P. Ramamurti, the Marxist theoretician and then in the undivided Communist Party of India (CPI), had unsuccessfully challenged CR’s nomination in the Madras High Court.\nKamaraj, who hailed from Virudhunagar in the southern belt of the State, was a Member of Parliament at the time of becoming the Chief Minister. The vacancy in the Legislative Assembly had existed only for Gudiyatham, which was part of the erstwhile North Arcot district (now split into Vellore, Ranipet, Thirupathur and Tiruvannamalai districts). At that time, Gudiyatham was a double-member constituency with one seat reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC).\nWhile Kamaraj, in June 1954, made it clear to the party that he would like to enter the fray for the general seat, the Scheduled Castes’ Federation (SCF), established by B.R. Ambedkar, had approached him with a request to let the Congress adopt its member for the reserved seat, according to a report of The Hindu on June 22, 1954. The report had even mentioned that [in the event of the request being accepted,] “this will be the first time” for the Congress and the SCF to have an electoral understanding. However, this proposal did not fructify, possibly due to the tense ties between Ambedkar and the Congress at the all-India level. Eventually, the SCF was left to put up its own candidate in Gudiyatham. For the reserved seat, the Congress’ nominee was T. Manavalan and the Federation’s, M. Krishnaswami.\nEven though the Congress’ candidate was the Chief Minister himself, the ruling party did not take chances. Two Central Ministers - Maragatham Chandrasekhar, who was Deputy Minister for Health, and T.T. Krishnamachari (TTK), Union Minister for Industry and Commerce - were drafted for the poll work, apart from C. Subramaniam, ranked no. 2 in the Kamaraj Cabinet and Finance Minister.\nThe Chief Minister’s principal rival was K. Kothandaraman of the CPI. Veteran journalist T.S. Chockalingam, in his biography of the former Chief Minister, mentions that members of the Congress all over the State had “turned their attention” towards Gudiyatham and “friends” from every district had begun their campaign for Kamaraj. There was “one more miracle” - the Dravidar Kazhagam and the Muslim League declaring publicly their support for him and commencing their canvassing.\nAlso Read |When BJP talks of Kamaraj rule…\nKamaraj was not one who would get carried away by “such widespread support.” He plunged himself in the campaign and carried out his work in villages. With a few weeks to go for the date of polling, he had covered 100 out of 160 villages in the constituency, The Hindu wrote on July 18, 1954. Responding to the criticism of the Communists that the Congress, despite being in power at the Centre and in States, had not resolved many problems of the country, Kamaraj, at a meeting in Cherlapalli, wondered how “age-long difficulties” of people could be removed within seven years of the country gaining Independence. Krishnamachari told the voters that Kamaraj was the “friend and follower” of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Being a person conscious of the living standards of the poor, he would “do his best” to raise them, TTK assured the voters.\nWhen the result was out on August 4, 1954, it was on expected lines. Kamaraj had defeated the CPI’s candidate by a comfortable margin - about 38,000 votes. That was the only occasion when the former Chief Minister was a candidate in the northern region of the State.\nNearly 15 years later, the political field in the State was not that benign either to Kamaraj or to the Congress. In early 1967, the national party was dislodged from power in the State nearly after a 20-year-long rule. Kamaraj himself lost in the Virudhunagar assembly constituency to a lightweight of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Spearheaded by CNA, the DMK, which had stitched a rainbow coalition comprising the Swatantara and the CPI (Marxist), had captured power in a stunning fashion. At the Centre, though the Congress was in power, there had been changes in the balance of power. The “old guard” in the ruling party was experiencing the phase of decline and naturally, there had been reports of difference between the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and some of her Cabinet colleagues, who were considered members of the “old guard.” As the Congress’ pre-eminent position in the country’s politics had started waning, new political forces were emerging.\nThe death of ‘Marshal’ A. Nesamony had necessitated the bye-election to the Nagercoil Lok Sabha constituency. Kamaraj, who was looking for an opportunity to regain people’s confidence after the Virudhunagar defeat, announced his candidature on December 1, 1968, this newspaper reported the next day. There were six other contestants. But, the battle was between him and M. Mathias, who was backed by the DMK-led alliance that included the Swatantara and the Muslim League.\nOrdinarily, Nagercoil should not have been difficult terrain for the Congress, which had a strong base even then, as is now. Besides, even in 1967, when the national party was thrashed in most of the districts, five out of six assembly constituencies, which formed Nagercoil, went in favour of the Congress. But, it was the DMK, which had decided to make the contest more intense.\nFormer Congress leader Pazha Nedumaran, in his “Perunthalaivarin Nizhalil” [In the shadow of great leader (meaning Kamaraj)], stated that the bye-election had been turned into another “Kurukshetra War,” the entire credit for which should go to the then Public Works Minister M. Karunanidhi and former Assembly Speaker Si. Pa. Aditanar, who later became a Minister in the DMK Cabinet headed by Karunanidhi. In the assessment of Mr Nedumaran, the DMK leaders had entertained the notion that if Kamaraj had tasted defeat [the possibility of which could not be ignored especially after Virudhunagar], he could be driven out of the politics of Tamil Nadu.\nWith the election fever mounting, the atmosphere was “getting surcharged” with a stream of lorries bringing supporters of rival parties from outside the district, The Hindu wrote on January 5, 1969, three days before the date of polling. “In the last 10 days, the Police have arrested about 200 persons, most of them Congressmen in connection with election clashes,” the newspaper reported. The then Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief, C.Subramaniam (CS), accused the DMK of bringing in “hired hooligans” from the neighbouring Tiruneveli district. Karunanidhi, who had overseen the campaign of Mathias, challenged CS’s allegations and put the blame on the Congress, which, he said, was “indulging in violence.” As for the complaint regarding the involvement of senior DMK Ministers in the campaign, Karunanidhi reasoned his party was “only following the example” set by the Congress. Kamaraj’s response was his party had refrained from inviting Union Ministers to campaign in the constituency, even though they were “ready to come.”\nThe bye-election frenzy rose to the boiling point on the midnight of January 4 when a worker of the DMK, Kittu, was killed and two others suffered stab injuries. That day, the head of the State police (which was called Inspector General) R.M. Mahadevan reached Nagercoil to oversee the preparations. The Superintendent of Police S. Dayasankar chose to go on medical leave for a month. He was immediately replaced by K. Srikumara Menon, Deputy Commissioner, Traffic. Madurai. On the day of polling (January 8), the then Chief Election Commissioner, S.P. Sen Verma, himself visited as many as 35 polling stations of the constituency, according to this newspaper. Given the high-decibel campaign, the voter turnout exceeded 75%, a few percentage points higher than what Nagercoil recorded in 1967.\nThere was no element of great surprise in the result. Kamaraj won the bye-election by a huge margin of 1,28,201 votes over Mathias, by polling 2,49,437 votes.\nCommenting on the former Chief Minister’s electoral battles, A. Gopanna, who had also authored his biography, feels Kamaraj always attached greater emphasis on drawing support from the people directly than anything else. R. Kannan, a biographer of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai and M.G. Ramachandran apart from writing ‘The DMK Years’, says Kamaraj, by contesting in Nagercoil, had “wanted to stay relevant.”\nKamaraj’s participation in the two bye-elections had only shown how much importance he, as a political leader, had paid to securing legitimacy from the public."

    "content": "Amid the ongoing row over alleged imposition of Hindi in schools through the National Education Policy (NEP), Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has defended the Union government’s proposal, saying that the former Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, has become a famed scholar by learning 17 languages.\n“P.V. Narasimha Rao was a scholar, fluent in 17 language. Now, we are talking why should we learn Hindi. Narasimha Rao had become a great man as he not only learnt Hindi but other languages too,” Mr. Naidu said while delivering the sixth of the PMs’ lecture series on the topic, ‘The life and legacy of P.V. Narasimha Rao’, at the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library, in New Delhi on Tuesday.\nDeputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan and HRD Minister N. Lokesh had already unequivocally supported promoting Hindi as a language.\nMr. Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party and Mr. Naidu-led TDP are partners in the NDA from South India.\nRecalling Narasimha Rao’s contribution in nation-building, Mr. Naidu, “I had a very good equation with him and knew him very well. The Telugu community is proud of him. He was a true ‘Telugu Bidda’ who had reshaped the destiny of our great nation,” Mr. Naidu observed.\nSpeaking about the pre-1991 economic scenario, Mr. Naidu outlined how the country had been shackled under the ‘License Raj’, with growth stagnating at 3-4%. By 1991, India was saddled in an unprecedented economic crisis, and foreign reserves dropped dangerously low, he said.\nComparing Narasimha Rao’s strategic courage to that of Deng Xiaoping of China, who initiated China’s reforms in 1978, Mr. Naidu said the former Prime Minister had recognised crisis as an opportunity and launched the historic 1991 economic reforms, decisively transforming India’s future. “We are all here today enjoying the fruits of the reforms he initiated,” Mr. Naidu asserted.\nPraising the political acumen of Narasimha Rao, the Chief Minister said, despite leading a minority government, he had achieved the near-impossible by forging consensus among Socialists, Communists, and Capitalists alike. Narasimha Rao had played a key role in ending the License Raj and welcoming foreign investment, and setting the stage for India’s IT revolution in the mid-1990s.\n“Thanks to his reforms, India overcame its balance of payments crisis, opened up its economy, and set the stage for future growth,” Mr. Naidu said.\nHe credited Narasimha Rao with the IT boom that was witnessed after the economic liberalisation. The Chief Minister also recalled his association with the former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, recognising his vision in building India’s infrastructure and telecom backbone.\nFurther, Mr. Naidu described 2014 as a turning point, and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with ushering in a new era of bold, decisive leadership. “Under Mr. Modi’s stewardship, India rose from the 11th to the 4th largest economy, with a clear trajectory to become the 3rd largest by 2028,” Mr. Naidu emphasised.\n“Mr. Modi is as a leader who instills national pride, global respect, and strong foreign relations,” he said. Drawing comparisons to other economies, he remarked that “the goal is not just to grow fast, but to grow fairly, where every citizen, every region, and every sector shares fruits of progress, rightly called Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.”\nHe also noted that according to the World Bank, India was among the top four most income-equal countries, lifting over 17.1 crore Indians out of poverty in the last decade.\n“Public policy must serve the people. For it to work effectively, we need stable governments and visionary leaders,” Mr. Naidu asserted. He highlighted India’s global recognition in space, healthcare, entrepreneurship, and the rise of Indian billionaires as symbols of this transformation.\nLater, Mr. Naidu took questions from the audience during which he elaborated his vision for Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the technology sector. He said that the Quantum Valley initiative was in line with the National Quantum Mission, aiming to create India’s answer to Silicon Valley. He highlighted curriculum reforms, youth leadership in his party, and a conscious effort to bring young, educated MLAs into governance.\nOn agriculture, he said, “We must handhold agriculture as our traditional occupations evolve.” On equitable wealth distribution, he emphasised the need to align the aspirations of farmers with broader policy reforms.\nMr. Naidu added, “I am 100% confident that by 2047, India will be the No. 1 country in the world. When we celebrate 100 years of Independence, Indians will lead the world.” The Chief Minister felicitated the former Prime Minister’s son, P.V. Prabhakar Rao, and grandson N.V. Subhash on the occasion."

It made its appearance late in the 19thcentury, chiefly as a game for cricket players to keep fit during the off season. ‘Playing hooky’ which meant going away from your official duties was an expression that came due to this. Interestingly, hockey or hooky was initially played in Madras without any knowledge of the rules of the game. The first record of it in the city dates back to 1894.\nThe Madras Hockey Tournament, played for “the Silver Cup presented by the Madras Cricket Club”, was the forerunner of what became the MCC All-India Hockey Tournament. The first announcement of this trophy appeared in the Madras Mail on July 20, 1901. The very first of its kind in South India, it commenced on July 22. Here again, as in cricket, we find the Madras United Club doing its bit to get Indians to play the game. The MUC’s XI, South India’s first ‘native team’ took to the field against the 25thBattery, Royal Field Artillery, from Bangalore. The MUC, judging by the report of the match, appears to have known little of the game, and was trounced 15-0. The next day, the MCC ‘A’ team appears to have played the eventual winner of the tournament, the Durham Light Infantry, with a detailed report of the match being carried by the Madras Mail. Newspaper reports referred to ‘dangerous play’ being a feature of the game.\nBy the 1920s, the game had come into its own especially with R.C. Summerhayes of Burma Shell, and a hockey blue from Oxford, taking special interest. He got the legendary M.J. Gopalan interested in the game. By the 1930s, Anglo Indian teams of Madras were taking the game to new heights. The Madras Hockey Association came into being in 1931. When it came to Indian participation in the Olympics, Madras produced its share of hockey players by way of R. Francis, Munir Sait, V. Baskaran, V.J. Philips, V.J. Peter and Krishnamurthy Perumal. We can also include Charles Cornelius here though he mainly played for Punjab.\nThe MCC All India Hockey Trophy was one of the big attractions during that golden era for the game. Teams from all over the country came to participate. But even then, there were breaks despite best efforts. The Murugappa Group, with its Murgappa Gold Cup instituted in 1962 to commemorate the 60thbirthday of A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar, joined the MCC in 1996 and since then the game has seen a fresh lease of life.\nThe semi-finals and finals of the ongoing tournament will take place on July 19 and 20 respectively. Initially played at Chepauk in the MCC’s B Ground, it has moved to the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium in recent times. For the first time this year, an overseas team, from Malaysia, is participating. And there is a third umpire to refer to. Finally, ten trees will be planted for every goal."

    "content": "Kolkata\nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers who are responsible for the improvement of nutrition and health of children are still awaiting their budget allocation, months after the declarations were made by the West Bengal government in February. Workers’ unions took out protest rallies in the city to demand increased budget allocation in nutrition, job security and permanent employment.\nThe rally was led by West Bengal Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union and All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) union of Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist). They took out three rallies and filed a deputation with the Governor of West Bengal, one at Nabanna (State Secretariat), addressing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and one at Bikash Bhawan (Child Welfare Department).\nUnion Secretary Madhavi Pandit said that if the demands are not met through the peaceful protest deputation, the workers will have to go on a larger strike in the coming days.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, another leader and ICDS worker from Murshidabad, Arifa Begum, who led the protest rally that went to Nabanna, said that as they do much of their work online, they have not been provided with smartphones to sustain the work.\n“The CM has only assured us, but there is no action on the ground. Both mother and child will lose out on their basic rights if we do not get the bare minimum. They give us ₹167 for mobile recharge. In the current economy, this is not even enough for a basic recharge to get enough data to do our work,” Ms. Begum added.\nThe workers also demanded that they get permanent job roles and fixed salaries for their labourious work. Nanda Patra, a leader of AIUTUC said that the ICDS workers are demanding that they get life insurance if anyone dies during work and a pension scheme when they retire to offer them better security.\nOn February 12, the West Bengal State budget for 2025-26 allocated ₹200 crore for the purchase of smartphones for about 70,000 ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) and Anganwadi workers. But workers say that they have not received any benefits from it even after five months.\nAnganwadi workers and ASHA workers (Accredited Social Health Activists) are the frontline healthcare workers in every community across districts and rural areas in States, helping bridge the gap between people and public healthcare systems. A major part of their job role is to provide essential services including nutritional supplements to children under six, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.\nHowever, in most States across India they are not permanent employees and do not have any employee benefits and struggle with budget issues. They are paid on contractual or honorarium basis which had led to many protests across the nation, including multiple in West Bengal."

    "content": "India’s diversity in religion and language is one of the primary factors which protects the secular character of the nation, ensuring its unity and integrity. But while religion and language are the two most crucial aspects of any culture, these are also the predominant cross-cultural barriers. This is clearly visible in recent communal tensions and the violence in Maharashtra.\nSecularism in India is different from what the West practises. When the concept originated in England in the mid-19th century, it was explained that there should be complete separation between the state and religion without criticising any of the prevalent religious beliefs. India too accepted this notion and incorporated the concept in the Constitution in the form of rights to religious freedom. These rights are based on the principles of religious tolerance and equality. Every person has the equal right to freedom of conscience and to profess, practise and propagate his religion. This makes India truly secular as the state does not have its own religion. However, the unique aspect of Indian secularism is not only related to religion but it is also concerned with language. Indian secularism is neither pro-religion or language, nor against. Yet it is not neutral either. It is incorporated in the Constitution as a state policy and it empowers the state to take steps against communalism, be it religious or linguistic.\nThis is the reason why we do not and cannot have a national language. In order to protect linguistic diversity, the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution includes 22 languages. As India is a unitary federation, that is, a Union of States, Article 343 enshrines that the official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The States are free to choose their own official language. This arrangement is due to the fact that in India, States are culturally integrated and no State is permitted to go out of it in the name of distinct language or culture.\nArticle 29 incorporates that any section of citizens of India including minority groups shall have the right to protect their language, script or culture, and that language cannot be the ground for discrimination. According to the 2011 Census, India has 121 languages and 270 mother tongues. About 96.71% population of the country have one of the 22 scheduled languages as their mother tongue. Finally, the Census says that the 121 languages are presented in two parts, languages included in the Eighth Schedule, and languages not included (99) in the Eighth Schedule.\nSuch diversity needs to be protected; each and every language irrespective of region or State must be shown respect. This is the only way to protect India’s linguistic secularism. Many southern and northeastern States have resisted the imposition of Hindi, citing fears of cultural domination. Dravidian movements in Tamil Nadu historically opposed Hindi imposition, favouring Tamil and English. Maharashtra, however, has emerged as the most sensitive State so far as the language debate is concerned. The recent violence against the non-Marathi population is the manifestation of identity politics. Definitely, it is not to protect its cultural identity. Had it been related to the protection of culture, the “protectors” of Marathi language would have considered that ‘tolerance’ and ‘liberality’ are the two pillars of India’s unity in diversity.\nIndia has always accepted different religions, ideas, lifestyles, food habits etc., mainly because of its liberal and tolerant attitude. In a globalising world, a conservative leaning towards religion or language will lead to a fragmentation of society and tear apart the secular fabric.\nPolitical parties have the onus to ensure the protection of India’s diversity which has been well shielded by the Constitution.\nC.B.P.

Maritime Board (APMB). The scheduled date of completion of the project was June 23, 2025.\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of the APMB sought the government’s guidance on the proposal for enhancement of the existing infrastructure to ensure the port’s commercial viability and its ability to handle the projected cargo volume of 34.04 MMTPA — primarily coal and iron ore — stating that it was essential to increase the port’s draft from 16m to 18.5m.\nThis would enable the port to accommodate Cape size and Super Cape size vessels, aligning its capabilities with regional and global shipping trends such as additional dredging at approach channel and berth pockets, additional railway lines up to the proposed backup yard behind three multi-purpose berths, development of backup yard infrastructure for storage of cargo, movement of trucks, and operation of material handling equipment, and additional external road connectivity and internal road connectivity within the port.\nThe APMB also requested Extension of Time (EoT) up to April 27, 2026, to the contractor for completion of the works due to analysis of work stoppages, delays in land handover, etc.\nTo consider the proposal, the GoM was constituted and asked to submit its  report / recommendations at an early date."

She also alleged that excess water release from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has led to flooding in many districts in the lower Damodar region, however, DVC has denied all allegations of unplanned water release.\nMs. Banerjee said that even after repeated warnings, the multiple dams of DVC have released heavy loads of water from Jharkhand and flooded West Bengal. She added that as Bengal is a land of water bodies filled with rivers, lakes, and ponds it suffers more during monsoons. She claimed that five lakh ponds have been dug up in the State in recent years to absorb some of the rainwater and reduce the burden on people.\nPlaces like Paschim Medinipur districts Ghatal, parts of Purba Bardhaman district, Khanakul, Arambagh in Hooghly district and Amta, Udaynarayanpur in Howrah district, and other places have been grappling with water logging for the past few weeks.\n“Be it DVC, Panchet, Maithon, none of them are listening to us. We have asked the Central government to do desilting work so they can hold an extra 4 lacs metric cusec water and help with this crisis. They have released over 27,000 lacs cubic meters of water between June 18 to July 15,” Ms. Banerjee said. She also said that they have been fighting this battle with the DVC water release and flooding for over 15 years but to no avail.\nHowever, DVC sources toldThe Hinduthat they release water only after discussions with the committee which includes West Bengal government, Jharkhand government and the DVC authorities along with the Central Water Commission. “They take view of all the stakeholders and advices about water release and we follow that order only, we do not decide water release amount on our own,” a top level official at the DVC who wanted remain anonymous said.\nThe CM also alleged that she has conducted multiple meetings and has urged the central government to find a solution. “People are facing huge losses. Assam gets flood relief money; we do not. They only release water here and abandon us... They get votes saying they will work for people, after the votes they only work for themselves,” Ms. Banerjee added.\nShe asked all government administrative officials to maintain vigil and constantly monitor the flood situation closely and to create more relief centers than before to help people affected by the floods. The CM asked officials to keep snake bite anti-venom in stock and ensure that no open electric lines cause any electrocution accidents."

Within a month, the party will expand, motivating people to join the party,” said former Minister Mr. Shinde.\nNCP-SP Supremo Sharad Pawar announced Mr. Shinde’s appointment at a party’s State executive meeting at the Y.B. Chavan Centre in Mumbai in the presence of prominent leaders from the party, including Jayant Patil, former Minister Anil Deshmukh, Kalwa legislator Jitendra Awhad, and Harshvardhan Patil.\nAfter the poor performance at the 2024 Assembly elections, Mr. Patil expressed his desire to resign and hand over to a new leader. Over the past few days, the resignation of Jayant Patil, who stayed back with Sharad Pawar’s NCP after the split in 2023 and the appointment of Shashikant Shinde was speculated. Mr. Shinde’s name has been announced ahead of the upcoming local body elections in the State, aiming to yield good results for the party.\nReferring to the vacuum in Maharashtra’s politics, the 62-year-old Mr. Shinde said, “Currently, space is there for Opposition. If we try to fill this space, people will relate and stand with us.”\nMr. Shinde also highlighted that politics have changed; earlier, the government changed when the opposition raised public concerns, now the government is changing using the resources and system of government.\nA commerce graduate and popularly known as the Mathadi workers’ leader, he began his political career in 1999, winning the Jaoli Assembly elections and later serving as Water Resources Minister.\n“This is not the end, it is the beginning of a new era,” Jayant Patil expressed his feelings through poetry. After offering his resignation, Mr. Patil touched on his tenure and the party’s journey of providing opportunities to people from ordinary families, shattering the nepotism.\n“The party broke the norms and gave opportunities to young people, including Mehboob Sheikh, Sakshana Salgar, and Sunil Gavane. Sharad Pawar gave strength to people who started from zero and gave them strength. I have been president for the last seven years; otherwise, I have been working in this party for the last 25 years. It is the right time to make way for others to take this opportunity,” he added\nMr. Patil reflected on the 2024 Assembly elections and stated that the match had been fixed Umpire. Reflecting on the government’s policy, he said, “We have a big challenge to preserve theSwarajyacreated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The State has been subjected to religious fanaticism and corruption on the pretext of development. The atrocities against women have increased, while farmers are in a dreadful situation. The government is proving incapable of keeping its promises.”"

    "content": "On the 71st convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) director Dr. Suman Chakraborty said “the world does not need more technocrats”, highlighting the institute’s renewed focus on human-centric, multidisciplinary technology research.\n“Let me be clear: the world does not need more technocrats. It needs humans who can think and feel — who can use algorithms, but are not ruled by them. The future belongs to those who can combine emotional intelligence with technical intelligence,” the director said.\nIn an exclusive interaction with select media, Mr. Chakraborty elaborated that earlier, technocrats relied on extensive research and skill-learning, whereas in the current day scenario, AI systems like ChatGPT can generate answers to most science and tech questions.\n“Unfortunately, it will take a whole lot of time to create a four-year undergraduate programme where answers will not be generable by ChatGPT. So, when these things are already there, students have to elevate themselves where they can innovate, interpret between lines, converge between domains, and come up with solutions that are both technologically advanced as well as human-centric,” the director said.\nHe added that IIT KGP is looking to equip future students with the knowledge of using AI more ethically.\nMr. Chakraborty also highlighted how the research on AI, deeptech, cloud computing, etc., at IIT KGP is advancing in converging domains, with a mix of traditional and non-traditional subjects like AI in diagnostics, medicine, law, humanities, etc.\n“In terms of research on AI, we are also thinking of exploring certain domains where the research will be led by non-AI domain experts… Usually, the engineering and science departments kick off science and tech projects, taking humanities and social sciences as complementary aspects in some cases. In that way, we are concerned with how AI can be more empathetically used to bridge the gap between AI and humans,” he said.\nMr. Chakraborty also said that IIT KGP is pushing boundaries with research across cybersecurity, AI, cloud computing, and disease modelling. He added that the AI models designed by the institute are being used for disaster response and precision agriculture.\n“Our AI department, now a full-fledged academic unit, offers BTech., MTech., and interdisciplinary dual degree programs. It has become a national leader in responsible and explainable AI with real-world applications in healthcare, climate, and linguistics, and with emphasis on human-centric AI… we are therefore not just building machines, we are building meaning,” he added.\nThe Director also unveiled PLATO, an AI-powered coding tutor that offers real-time, personalised guidance to students learning computer programming.\nThe director said that the institute is working on its “shortcomings” to make itself a more preferred choice for nationwide talent.\n“We are good at classroom teaching, but beyond that, we are working on improving infrastructure, improving quality of life, and making campus life more vibrant. We should connect everything. As part of our Platinum Jubilee, we are also building a special amenities centre, an all-in-one unit that can help students have an enjoyable lifestyle while facilitating all-round growth,” Mr. Chakraborty said.\nMr. Chakraborty also touched upon the global gender disparity in science, technology, medicine and engineering,\n“Women are not just contributors — they are disruptors, creators, and changemakers — and at IIT KGP, we thrive not merely to preach this spirit but portray the same in practice,” he added.\nNotably, gender ratios in several branches of the IIT remain skewed despite girl students excelling in all-India examinations. On Tuesday, less than half of the graduating students being awarded prestigious medals at IIT KGP’s convocation ceremony were women.\nThis year, IIT KGP awarded a total of 3,731 degrees across various disciplines, including 277 PhD, 18 MS, 956 M.Tech, 50 MCP, 142 MBA, 23 EMBA, 58 PGDBA, 5 MMST, 28 MHRM, 18 M.Arch, 47 LLM, 31 LLB, 786 Dual Degree, 614 B.Tech (Hons), 46 B.Arch (Hons), 151 Four-Year B.S, 260 Five-Year M.Sc, 214 Two-Year M.Sc, 3 M.Sc M.Tech, 3 Three-Year M.Sc, and 1 Certificate of Excellence in Research (CER).\nAwards such as the President’s Gold Medal, Prime Minister’s Gold Medal, and others were conferred upon graduating students and scholars.\nDr. S. Somanath, former chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was the chief guest."

    "content": "For years, Kumari Hema* never truly belonged anywhere. A 32-year-old mother of one, she moved from colony to colony in Hyderabad, chased by whispers, evicted by landlords, and judged by neighbours who recoiled the moment they learnt the truth: that she was a survivor of sexual assault.\n“We used to skip meals just to pay ₹3,500 in rent for a place that barely felt like a home,” she recalled, her voice quivering with emotion. “Even then, the owners would harass us,” she said.\nThat burden, she says, has now been lifted.\nHema is one of several survivors who have been allotted a 2BHK flat in newly-built community housing in the city’s emerging residential hubs. This is part of an initiative by the Telangana government under its Indiramma Indlu housing scheme. The homes are being allotted to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) victims of serious crimes, including rape and murder cases, where convictions have been secured, with the aim of offering safety, dignity and a fresh start.\n“Now, no one can ask me to leave. I have a house of my own. My name is on the patta certificate. For someone whose name was once on an FIR, this feels like a real identity,” she said, smiling through her eyes.\nFor 27-year-old Sonal*, life too had come to a halt after she was sexually assaulted. A promising engineering student at the time, she dropped out of college and retreated from the world due to the trauma and pain the incident brought. Now, years later, she has cleared the Telangana Law Common Entrance Test and is preparing to start an LLB course through distance education in about a month.\n“I stopped believing that a future was even possible,” the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) victim said. “But things are changing. I’ve got a second chance in my studies, in my marriage, and now in my own new home.” Sonal, who works part-time as a teacher got married six months ago and is about to move into her new flat with her husband. She is already scouting for nearby schools to work at while continuing her education.\nSudha Laxmi*, 35, a mother of two and a domestic worker, has lived in the same locality for nearly three decades. But familiarity did not spare her from stigma after she was assaulted, even after the perpetrator was convicted. “Neighbours never let me forget it. I faced taunts for years,” she said. “I’m relieved to leave it all behind.”\nThe women are waiting for final plumbing and electrical work to be completed before they shift into the apartments, built as part of the first phase of the government’s broader housing initiative for atrocity victims. Under this phase, 43 survivors in Cyberabad and 25 from Rachakonda have been allotted homes.\nThe district’s SC Development Wing, in collaboration with the police, compiles lists of eligible victims. These are cases from 2014 onwards that ended in conviction. The focus, officials say, is on verified cases to avoid legal complications and ensure security.\n“These are people who were not just victims of crime, but also of societal neglect. The least we can do is give them a sense of belonging,” said a senior police officer associated with the project.\n“The entire process is handled discreetly. In most cases, they are moved into neighbourhoods where others from their community already live.”\nThe 2BHK homes themselves are simple but sufficient. Each flat is 560 square feet, with two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen, and two bathrooms. The kitchen opens out onto a small balcony with a washing area. Many occupants have chosen to upgrade the flooring, add tiles or false ceilings, or personalise the space in a small but meaningful ways.\n*Names have been changed to protect the identities of the survivors."

During their journey, the woman, who was pregnant, went into labour and gave birth to a baby boy. However, the couple wrapped the newborn in a piece of cloth and threw him out of the vehicle,” the official said.\nThe driver of the sleeper bus, which has compartments with upper and lower berths, noticed that something was thrown out of a window. When he enquired about it, Shaikh told him that his wife had vomited as she felt nauseated due to the bus journey, he said.\n“Meanwhile, when an alert citizen on the road checked what was thrown out of the bus window, he was shocked to find that it was a baby boy. He immediately alerted the police by calling their 112 helpline,” he said.\nA team of the local police on patrolling duty subsequently intercepted the bus. After inspecting the vehicle and conducting a preliminary probe, they took the woman and Shaikh into custody, the official said.\nThe couple said they dumped the newborn as they were unable to raise the child, he said, adding that the baby died after being thrown on the road.\nAccording to the police, Dhere and Shaikh both hailed from Parbhani and were staying in Pune for the last one-and-a-half years. They claimed to be husband and wife but failed to produce any document to support the claim, the official said.\n“After taking them into custody, the police rushed the woman to a hospital for treatment,” he said.\nA case was registered against the couple at Pathri police station in Parbhani under section 94 (3), (5) of BNS (concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body), he said.\nA notice has been served to the accused persons, and further probe in the case was underway, he said."

    "content": "For 12 long years, 29 tribal families from the Kodarvi community lived in exile, forced to leave their ancestral village of Mota Pipodra in Danta taluka in Banaskantha district due to an age-old custom known as ‘Chadotaru’—a tradition rooted in vengeance. But now, these families, comprising around 300 members, will finally return home, on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nThe Kodarvi families had migrated to Palanpur and Surat over a decade ago, leaving behind their homes, land, and memories. The ‘Chadotaru’ custom, which had led to disputes, made life in the village untenable for them. For years, they lived as outsiders, yearning to return but bound by fear and tradition.\nRecognising their plight, the Banaskantha police initiated a meticulous process of reconciliation, and held multiple meetings with village elders, panchayat members, and community leaders to ensure a peaceful homecoming, said Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi.\nAdding to the emotional significance of this return, the District Administration identified and revived the families’ ancestral land—approximately 8.5 hectares of once-barren terrain that had turned wild with neglect. “The land was cleared, leveled, and made cultivable again, symbolising a fresh start,” Mr. Sanghavi said.\nAs part of the rehabilitation plan, two houses have already been constructed, while the remaining 27 families will receive homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and with the support of social organisations, the Minister said.\nOn July 17, Mr. Sanghavi said that they would welcome the families back to Mota Pipodra in a ceremony. The event will include a prayer ritual and the symbolic sowing of seeds on their revitalised land—a gesture of renewal and prosperity. The Minister said he would also distribute educational kits, ration supplies, and discuss long-term rehabilitation plans with the families.\n“This is not just about bringing people back to their village; it is about healing old wounds and building a future of harmony,” said Mr. Sanghavi. “We believe no tribal family should be left displaced due to outdated customs. Development and dialogue will always triumph over discord.”\nFor the Kodarvi families, this homecoming is nothing short of a miracle—a chance to reclaim their roots, their land, and their dignity."

    "content": "The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave in-principle approval for the rejuvenation and beautification of Ramannakunta Lake in New Bowenpally, marking a major step toward transforming the long-neglected water body into a vibrant recreational and ecological space. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has proposed a detailed plan for the lake’s revival, including desilting, bund strengthening, stone revetment, and the creation of amenities such as open gyms, children’s play areas, and a walking track.\n“The beautification of Ramannakunta Lake has been approved by the Board. We are now awaiting a No Objection Certificate from the Army since the lake falls under their jurisdiction. The project is intended not just to enhance the area’s livability but also to improve groundwater recharge and local biodiversity,” said Madhukar Naik, CEO of SCB.\nThe proposal is part of a wider slate of urban development initiatives discussed during Tuesday’s Board meeting, which saw deliberations on infrastructure, public health, and civic administration.\nThe board discussed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HMDA for infrastructure development in lieu of direct cash compensation for the Defence land.Instead of depositing ₹303.62 crore into the Consolidated Fund of India, the State Governmenthas proposed carrying out development works such as underground sewer upgrades, strengthening of the Picket and Hasmathpet nalas, and stormwater drain construction across various Cantonment wards. An escrow account, as mandated by the Ministry of Defence’s corrigendum dated July 8, will track expenditures and project milestones. HMDA will also be responsible for funding any cost overruns or shortfalls.\nOn the healthcare front, the Board is expected to finalise an MoU with Maxvision Eye Hospital to offer cashless eye treatment to SCB employees and their dependents. This step aligns with Central Government directives allowing treatment at CGHS-empanelled hospitals at CGHS rates, thereby eliminating the need for upfront payments by beneficiaries.\nThe SCB has approved the installation of open gym equipment across various residential colonies and parks under its jurisdiction. The initiative aims to improve public health infrastructure and promote fitness among residents. In line with this, the Board is also considering the approval of specific locations for the installation of the open gym equipment. A total of ten sites across different wards have been proposed, ensuring equitable access to fitness amenities in multiple neighbourhoods, added Mr. Madhukar Naik."

    "content": "The Kerala Home department has reportedly endorsed the then State Police Chief’s (SPC) reportwhich states that a sequence of preventable oversights on the part of the State law enforcement and certain sections of the temple management contributed to the widespread public dissatisfaction over the conduct of the iconic Thrissur Pooram ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.\nThe State Cabinet had ordered the then SPC Sheikh Darvesh Saheb to conduct a multi-tiered probe into the alleged Thrissur Pooram “disruption”. It brought the then Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, M. R. Ajith Kumar, who was the highest-ranking officer at the festival venue, under the investigation’s ambit.\nAccording to official sources, Home Secretary Biswanath Sinha “made a note recommending appropriate action” on the SPC’s report and forwarded it to the Cabinet. However, the officials said they were unsure whether the report pointedly blamed Mr. Ajith Kumar for the “policing flaws”.\nThe Thrissur Pooram “disruption” controversy rapidly acquired a political dimension during the heat of the Lok Sabha election campaign. The Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later faulted the State police for “botching” the festival.\nSubsequently, Revenue Minister K. Rajan, who is in charge of Thrissur district and was actively involved in the festival’s conduct, seemed to tacitly endorse the CPI’s accusation by stating that a top-ranking official in charge of the festival’s security, crowd control, fireworks, public safety, emergency response and traffic management did not respond to his urgent calls.\nLater, the Congress and the CPI alleged that the festival’s “disruption” had adversely impacted public opinion and paved the way for the BJP’s resounding win in the Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency. Both parties signalled a conspiracy allegedly involving a ranking officer and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leadership to bolster the BJP’s chances of bagging the Thrissur seat.\nAccording to officials, the SPC’s report blamed administrative, planning and law enforcement “blind spots” for the “brief discontinuance” of the festivities.\nThey said the SPC’s investigation possibly side-stepped the political controversies centred around the issue and focussed more on providing a roadmap for the festival’s smooth conduct.\nThe SPC also reportedly emphasised the need for stakeholders, including the Thiruvambady-Paramekkavu Devaswoms and the district administration, to reach a consensus on sensitive matters such as crowd control, road closures, vehicular and pedestrian traffic management, fireworks, and elephant processions, rather than making arbitrary and impromptu decisions that cause unnecessary friction."

    "content": "The Water Resources Department (WRD) will establish a separate wing, State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO), with a dedicated chief engineer for effective management of dam safety and implementation of various initiatives, including dam rehabilitation and improvement projects in Tamil Nadu.\nThe SDSO will be the 15thwing of the WRD, bifurcated from the Operation and Maintenance Wing, and would adhere to the Dam Safety Act, 2021. The State government recently issued an order, notifying the constitution of the SDSO headed by a chief engineer to adhere to the requirements of the Act and perform the functions specified by it.\nThe Act specifies that States with more than 30 dams must have an SDSO. Therefore, the formation of a wing was essential to prioritise the safety of dams that are several decades old. Tamil Nadu has nearly 128 dams, including 90 under the WRD and 38 under the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco).\nSources in the WRD said that the functions of the SDSO could not be effectively carried out due to the lack of a functional head. This wing would be a monitoring and advisory body, which would coordinate with the State Dam Safety Committee and National Dam Safety Authority. It would have 25-30 members with expertise in hydrology, dam hydro mechanics, and dam safety engineering.\nThe wing would perform various activities like inspection, vulnerability and hazard classification of the dams, recording dam failures and funds for maintenance and repairs. Moreover, some of the major tanks and water bodies would be brought under the dam category, warranting enhanced monitoring and special attention, sources said.\nBesides inspection of the dams once in five years, ongoing initiatives likeDRIP-II being carried out with World Bank assistancewould be expedited.\nThe new wing would also coordinate with National Dam Safety Authority on rapid risk assessment of dams to evaluate potential impact during dam failure."

I have a better idea for you. Why don’t you look at Andhra Pradesh instead? We have an attractive aerospace policy for you, with best-in-class incentives and over 8000 acres of ready-to-use land (just outside  Bengaluru)! Hope to see you soon to talk across the table.”\nHis father and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had earlier ruffled feathers in Karnataka by offering a 10,000-acre land parcel in Anantapur district to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for potential expansion.\nKarnataka’s Labour Minister Santosh Lad, meanwhile, assured that the State government will “find a solution” to the land acquisition issue. Speaking to news agency ANI, he said that the government has asked famers to voluntarily give their land and clarified that the project isn’t scrapped. “For the last five decades, we have been in the number one position in GDP. We will find a solution. The farmers had a strong opinion that this land should not be given to anyone else. We have asked farmers to voluntarily give us their land. It doesn’t mean the project is scrapped,” he said.\nThe Karnataka government had proposed acquiring 1,777 acres of land in Devanahalli taluk for an aerospace park. While the final notification for the project had been issued, Karnataka government dropped the process of land acquisition in 13 villages following resistance by farmers. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nMr. Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15. However, he also said that the government would acquire property of those farmers who have volunteered to give up their land for the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of a developed land."

    "content": "The political temperature is rising in the Union Territory of Puducherry ahead of the 2026 Assembly election with the Opposition upping the ante against Bharatiya Janata Party and its ruling ally the All India N. R. Congress headed by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy following the contentious decision to replace the sole BJP Minister from the Scheduled Caste community with a party legislator who had come under the scanner of the High Court and the Puducherry police in a temple land grab case.\nRecently, the BJP high command had asked its Minister from the Dalit community A. K.Sai J. Saravanan Kumar to step down ostensibly as part of a prior understanding of sharing the Cabinet berth. Even as the move to remove the sole Dalit representative in the Cabinet triggered an outcry in the political circles, what has exacerbated matters is the choice of BJP legislator A. John Kumar, who had come under a cloud in a land grab case involving a prime property belonging to the famed Kamatchi Amman Temple in the heart of the city.\nThe issue being held against Mr. Kumar’s induction is a case the CB-CID wing of the Puducherry police had registered in 2023 in connection with the grabbing of around 64,000 sq. ft. of Kamatchi Amman temple land at Rainbow Nagar in the town. The police registered a case against several Revenue Officials for conniving with a business group to grab the land. During investigation, the role of some politicians had also surfaced.\nIn the meantime, on a petition filed by a devotee, the High Court had directed Mr. Kumar, his legislator son Richards John Kumar, also belonging to the BJP, and four of their family members to return the temple property to prove their bona fide in the wake of their claim of having been innocent purchasers who had no role to play in the allegations of fabrication of documents, corruption, and collusion with government officials to grab the temple land.\nThe Court had asked the government to take possession of the land and directed the two legislators to subject themselves to the criminal investigation undertaken by the CB-CID in Puducherry. Subsequently, the District Administration took possession of the land and handed over the property to the Kamatchi Amman Temple trust.\nThough the CB-CID had made several arrests, including two senior officers belonging to Pondicherry Civil Services, the probe agency has maintained a silence on the progress made in the case which invited criticism from the Opposition parties. The Enforcement Directorate had alsosuo moturegistered a case and sought details from the government about particulars of the case.\nThe case related to the temple land had started to hound Mr. Kumar ever since his name cropped up for the Ministerial berth to fill the vacancy, with the Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), vehemently opposing the decision of the BJP to include the Kamaraj Nagar constituency legislator in Mr. Rangasamy-led Cabinet. Opposition leaders have issued statements criticising the BJP for projecting an image of being “proponents of Hindutva while allowing people involved in temple land grabbing case to occupy Ministerial position.”\nApart from the Congress and the Left parties, the Hindu Munnani too has taken up cudgels against the BJP for inducting a partyman who was facing temple land grab charges. On the very day the Ministry of Home Affairs cleared the name of Mr. Kumar for being inducted into the Cabinet, around 75 Youth Congress workers sent letters to President Droupadi Murmu seeking her intervention in preventing Mr. Kumar from becoming a Minister as he and his family members were under the scanner in a case relating to usurping temple land.\nThe Hindu Munnani, which had been in the forefront of a campaign opposing the temple land grab, has come out in the open against the BJP local leadership for inducting a “scam-tainted” person in the Cabinet. Just hours before Lieutenant Governor K. Kailashnathan administered the oath of office to Mr. Kumar at Raj Nivas on Monday, several Hindu Munnani activists held a day-long protest in the town over giving the legislator a Cabinet berth.\nThe Hindu Munnani activists who participated in the protest vowed to intensify the agitation in the coming days. The cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also held a separate protest during the same time against the swearing-in of the BJP legislator.\nCiting the appointment of Mr. Kumar as a Minister, former Chief Minister and Congress veteran V. Narayanasamy at a press conference termed the Hindutva ideology stated by the BJP as “fake” and hinted at the Congress party’s plans to expose the BJP for giving a Ministerial berth to a person accused of grabbing temple land.\nAs the issue gets more traction in the political arena of the Union Territory, the BJP would have to redouble its efforts to convince followers that its legislator was an innocent victim who was duped into buying usurped temple land and that Mr. Kumar was offered a Ministerial post to honour a prior understanding to strengthen the outreach to Christian community in the former French enclave.\nAlong with the induction of Mr. Kumar into the Cabinet, another issue that has put the BJP in a tight spot and given the Opposition fresh ammunition against the ruling establishment ahead of the 2026 Assembly poll was the decision to replace Mr. Sai Saravanan. He was the lone Dalit member in Mr. Rangasamy’s Cabinet after the AINRC legislator, S. Chandira Priyanga, was removed from the Cabinet reportedly because the Chief Minister was not satisfied with her handling of subjects assigned to her.\nThe AINRC-BJP combine has come in for severe criticism from the Opposition ranks on the omission of a Scheduled Caste representative from the Cabinet. With the Opposition, particularly Congress, giving enough indication of keeping the issues of appointment of Mr. Kumar in the Ministry and lack of Dalit representation in the Cabinet, alive by organising a series of agitations against the ruling combine, it is unlikely that the political temperature will come down any time soon."

The brand, however, clarified in a reply to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce that the showcased sandals are still at the design stage and not yet confirmed for commercial production.\n“Four members of their technical team, including the heads of footwear design of Prada and two external consultants, visited Kolhapur on Tuesday (July 15, 2025). They toured the Kolhapuri chappal manufacturing cluster, observed the production process, and held discussions with local artisans,\" said Lalit Gandhi, president of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.\nHighlighting the craftsmanship involved, Mr. Gandhi said, “Our chappals are handmade and rooted in tradition. The team will now submit a report to its corporate office, and based on that, senior officials from Prada may visit Kolhapur in the next phase.” When asked about the possibility of collaboration, Mr. Gandhi said the visit itself was a positive sign. “The fact that Prada sent a technical team all the way to Kolhapur indicates serious interest. This is perhaps the first time a Prada delegation has come to Maharashtra,” he said.\nHe further said that Prada had created a product inspired by the Kolhapuri chappals. “Once we noticed the design on the runway, we raised an objection and asked them to acknowledge its origins. They responded to us via email, accepting that the theme was inspired by Kolhapuri chappals,” said Gandhi.\nLater on Tuesday, the visiting team also toured the retail market area in Kolhapur and interacted with shopkeepers."

Failure to file the reports in the next eight weeks will have consequences, the bench noted sternly.\nIn January 15,the court ruled that access to proper sanitationis recognised as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Issuing a slew of directions, it asked High Courts, State governments and UTs to ensure availability of separate toilet facilities for men, women, persons with disabilities and transgender persons in all court premises and tribunals.\nIt also asked for a status report within four months.\nOn Wednesday, the bench noted that only the High Courts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Calcutta, Delhi and Patna had filed affidavits giving details of actions taken to comply with the directions of the judgement.\nThere are 25 High Courts in the country.\n“Many High Courts are yet to file their affidavits/compliance report… we grant them the last opportunity to file the compliance reports within eight weeks. We make it clear that if they fail to file the status reports, then the registrar general of the High Courts will remain present personally in the court,” the bench ordered.\nIn its January 15 judgement, the court said the High Courts shall oversee and ensure that the facilities are clearly identifiable and accessible to judges, advocates, litigants and court staff.\n\"For the aforesaid purpose, a committee shall be constituted in each of the High Courts under the chairmanship of a Judge nominated by the Chief Justice and members comprising the Registrar General/Registrar of the High Court, the Chief Secretary, the PWD Secretary and the Finance Secretary of the State, a representative of the Bar Association and any other officers as they deem it fit...\"\nIt directed the committee to formulate a comprehensive plan and compile numbers on how many people visited the courts every day on an average and ensure that sufficient separate washrooms are built and maintained.\n\"The State Governments/UTs shall allocate sufficient funds for construction, maintenance and cleanliness of the toilet facilities within the court premises, which shall be periodically reviewed in consultation with the committee constituted by the High Courts. A status report shall be filed by all the High Courts and the States/UTs within a period of four months,\" the bench said.\nThe top court's judgement came on a PIL filed by advocate Rajeeb Kalita."

It helps ascertain if students are just beginning to use drugs or they are hooked on to it. This enables counsellors to make informed decisions about the referral services needed by students, whether it is counselling or medication to help them kick the drug habit.\nTeachers and parents too can use this screening test for a more effective response to the drug problem.\nThe counsellors say follow-ups will held them know if students are taking the medication required to wean them away from drugs or have resumed substance abuse.\nThey also stress the need for healthy family relationships for children’s well-being and keeping an eye on children, their rooms, and belongings to spot signs of drug abuse, if any, early and asking for help instead of trying to hide it."

People’s lives are more important than loan recovery,” he said.\nThe Minister said that none should act inhumanly during loan recovery.

I will also raise this with the Chief Minister,” he said.\nDeputy Commissioner Divya Prabhu G.R.J. said that all banks had been warned against adjusting any government aid or compensation towards farm loans. “A formal proposal in this regard had already been submitted to the State Bankers’ Committee and the government by the district administration,” she said.\nShe mentioned that, sometimes due to technical reasons, government funds might get credited to loan accounts, but the banks were now returning the funds to beneficiaries’ savings accounts.  The Deputy Commissioner said that as the issue was prevalent across the country, it required rectification at the government level."

    "content": "Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, officially known as Kanthapuram A. P. Aboobacker Musliyarand serving as the tenth Grand Mufti of India, has successfully facilitated the deferment of the execution of Indian nurse Nimisha Priya in Yemen. The intervention, built on his role as India’s highest Sunni religious authority and carried out through Islamic legal norms likediyāh(blood money), spotlights a rare instance of religious and diplomatic mediation in a foreign Sharia court.\nSheikh Abubakr Ahmad was elected Grand Mufti of India on February 24, 2019, by the All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam, a national body of Sunni clerics. Born as A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar in Kanthapuram, Kozhikode, Kerala, he has risen to national prominence through his decades-long leadership in Islamic education, social welfare, and public discourse. He is also the general secretary of the All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama and the Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama — two of India’s most influential Sunni Muslim organisations. His rise to the title of Grand Mufti, a largely symbolic but influential position, marked a historic moment as he became one of the few South Indian scholars to hold the post.\nAccording to his official website, Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad is the founder and chancellor of Markazu Saquafathi Sunniyya (Jamia Markaz), established in 1978 in Kerala. The institution has expanded to encompass a comprehensive network of educational centres, charitable organisations, and social service units. He has represented Indian Muslim scholars at international forums, including sessions at the United Nations and events organised by UNESCO. He is also a regular participant in global interfaith conferences. Through initiatives such as the International Peace Conference and Markaz-run educational programmes, he has been involved in activities focused on education, religious scholarship, and community welfare.\nThecase of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala, sentenced to death in Yemen for the 2017murder of Yemeni national Talal Abdo Mahdi, drew widespread attention in India. With the execution scheduled for July 16, 2025, urgent appeals were made by human rights activists and public representatives. Among them was Kerala Congress MLA Chandy Oommen, who approached Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, requesting his intervention to secure clemency under Islamic law. Recognising the urgency and humanitarian concern, the Grand Mufti reached out to prominent Yemeni Sufi scholar Sheikh Habib Umar bin Hafiz to explore the possibility of obtaining a pardon from the victim’s family under the Islamic concept ofdiyāh.\nAlso Read:Execution of Indian nurse in Yemen: Sunni leader Kanthapuram talks to Yemeni scholar in bid to save Nimisha Priya’s life\nYemen’s legal system, rooted in Islamic law, allows for the family of a murder victim to pardon the accused in exchange for financial compensation, ordiyāh. Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad utilised this principle in his appeal, stating that Islam encourages forgiveness and reconciliation. He emphasised to Yemeni religious leaders that “in Islam, there is another law where the victim’s family pardons the accused”. He suggested that this path be pursued in the case of Nimisha Priya. Through coordinated efforts involving Yemeni tribal leaders, judicial authorities, and religious scholars, her execution was temporarily deferred.\nThe most immediate outcome ofSheikh Abubakr Ahmad’s intervention has been the postponement of Nimisha Priya’s execution. The stay was granted after last-minute negotiations in Damar, Yemen, initiated through religious channels. Talks between the victim’s family and mediators, both religious and diplomatic, are ongoing. The hope now is to secure a full pardon through a formaldiyāhagreement, which could lead to Nimisha Priya ’s release from capital punishment.\nIn a final bid to save Nimisha Priya, Mr. Aboobacker Musliar has appealed to Mahdi’s family to pardon her. With her execution looming, Nimisha Priya’s fate now rests on the victim’s family’s willingness to accept $1 million indiyāh(blood money) and grant her clemency. Sources close to Mr. Aboobacker Musliar have been hopeful that Habib Omar’s respected status and influence in Yemeni society will help secure a favourable outcome for Nimisha.\nAddressing the media at Karanthur, near Kozhikode, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Aboobacker Musliar said that he successfully appealed to Yemeni scholars to intervene in Nimisha Priya’s case, considering the importance of saving a human life. “We have just received official confirmation from the Yemeni authorities that Nimisha Priya’s execution has been stayed based on our request. Let us all pray for her safe release,” he said."

    "content": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) began the final hearing on a writ petition filed for vacating the Tambaram Police Commissionerate from a rented building located on Semmozhi Salai in Sholinganallur and to hand over the vacant possession of the premises to its owners.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh heard the arguments advanced by senior counsel V. Raghavachari for the owners of the property, D.H. Sarath Kumar, D. Venkatesh, and D. Choudry, who had filed the writ petition, on Wednesday and decided to hear Advocate General P.S. Raman on Thursday (July 17).\nIn his submissions, the senior counsel said, the petitioners had rented out their property measuring 27,250 sq. ft. to the police commissionerate from January 2022 only on the basis of an assurance given by its first Commissioner M. Ravi to pay a monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh.\nAccordingly, a lease agreement was signed for three years between the property owners and an Additional Superintendent on behalf of the Commissionerate, agreeing for the monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh for 11 months and to revise it periodically as per market value.\nHowever, the State government did not pay the rent for several months citing the objections raised by the Finance department and finally, it came out with an offer of a monthly rent of ₹6.33 lakh on the basis of an inspection carried out by a Public Works Department Executive Engineer.\nSince the petitioners were not agreeable to the offer made by the government, they insisted on vacating the property and handing over vacant possession but the Police department was continuing to occupy it, citing its strategic location and easy access to the public, the senior counsel said.\nFurther, stating that the petitioners had rented out only ground plus four floors to the commissionerate, he complained that the Police department had unauthorisedly put up constructions on the terrace too. He said, even the car parking area was not spared and as many as 45 cabins had been created over there.\nAfter turning the open car parking area too into an office, the Police department had put up car sheds on an adjacent piece of land, which had not been rented out to the commissionerate, and begun to park its cars over there. Such unauthorised use of the land had led to blocking the passage to the petitioners’ another property, he said.\n“It is the law enforcement machinery which is doing all this. I can’t go and complain to anybody but for this court. The Tambaram Commissionerate wasinaugurated by the Chief Minister himself. The owners are in deep distress. They have debts too. They want to sell this property after vacating the tenant,” the senior counsel added.\nAfter relying upon a judgment in support of his plea to direct the government and the police commissionerate to vacate the rented property, Mr. Raghavachari said: ‘”When the British ruled us, we were complaining about lack of rule of law. Now, we are ruling ourselves and still there is no rule of law.”"

Chinchurani announced the decision at a press conference here on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) after a high-level meetingamid rising cases of stray dog bites and deaths due to rabies.\nAs per Section 8 of the Animal Husbandry Rules, the euthanasia of an animal can be carried out when the Union government or the State government finds any animal which is so diseased that it can spread the disease, in order to control such disease. A registered veterinary practitioner has to certify that the animal is mortally injured or so severely injured or in such a physical condition that it shall be cruel to keep it alive.\nMr. Rajesh said the State government had to depend on the Animal Husbandry Rules for allowing euthanasia of diseased stray dogs as the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules do not allow euthanasia.\n“The State government will again request the Union government to amend the ABC rules as it slows down the progress of ABC activities. Another challenge is the opposition from the local population against opening ABC centres. The government will take action related to obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions against those who try to impede the functioning of ABC units,” he said.\nEight mobile ABC units, purchased by the Animal Husbandry department, will be deployed immediately. The Local Self-Government department will also over the next two months deploy mobile ABC units in each of the 152 block panchayats in the State. Panchayats have been directed to identify ideal locations to park the mobile units. The mobile units are meant to overcome the local opposition while setting up permanent ABC centres in various localities. Vaccination of stray dogs will be carried out in August. Licensing and vaccination of pet dogs will done in September."

    "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee lashed out at the BJP-led Centre on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) for what, she called, its policy of harassing and mistreating Bengali-speaking people across the country and warned the saffron party of dire political consequences if it did not put an immediate stop to such actions.\nMs. Banerjee also alleged that the ruling dispensation at the Centre was “influencing the Election Commission of India” to achieve its political ambitions across states.\nShe was speaking at a public meeting after holding a protest march in rain-drenched Kolkata against the alleged torture of Bengali-speaking people in BJP-ruled States.\n“I will challenge the central government notices which were surreptitiously sent to BJP-ruled states to harass Bengali-speaking people and detain them at the slightest suspicion,” the Trinamool Congress supremo alleged at the rally, which terminated at the Dorina Crossing in central Kolkata.\n“I am ashamed and disheartened at the Centre and the BJP's attitude towards Bengalis,” Ms. Banerjee claimed.\nExpressing her resolve to fight the BJP “inch by inch” if it tried to \"persecute\" Bengali-speaking people, she said that the saffron camp should remain prepared for a fresh round of ‘Khela Hobey’ (the game-is-on slogan coined ahead of the 2021 state polls) during the Assembly elections in 2026.\n“I have decided to speak more in Bangla from now on, hold me in detention camps if you can,” she said while attacking the BJP.\nSenior leaders of the party, including TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, joined Banerjee as she led thousands of people in the march, which began from College Square in central Kolkata around 1.45 pm.\nThe march will terminate at Dorina Crossing in Dharmatala.\nThe nearly 3-km route was wrapped in security, with nearly 1,500 police personnel guarding the barricaded pavements and adjacent buildings.\nVehicular traffic was diverted along multiple arterial roads in the central parts of the city because of the programme.\nSimilar demonstrations have also been organised by the TMC in the district headquarter towns across the State.\nThe protests are being held a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to the State.\nAsserting that there are nearly 22 lakh migrant workers from Bengal working in other parts of the country, who have valid identity documents like Aadhar, EPIC and PAN cards, Banerjee said she would not tolerate any disrespect meted out to them on flimsy grounds.\n“What right does the BJP have in harassing Bengalis like this, even arresting them and forcefully pushing them back to Bangladesh? Is West Bengal not part of India?” she asked.\nStating that \"extreme situations call for extreme counter measures\", Banerjee said, \"I will say this in the simplest of words. We will not fight you physically. But if the BJP doesn’t put an end to its persecution policies immediately, then the Trinamool Congress knows how to make them stop.\""

Bindu has said that the government intends to implement the revised normalisation process for the KEAM State engineering entrance examination from the next academic year.\nThe proposed pattern had to be put on hold after the Kerala High Court annulled the original rank list published by the Commissioner for Entrance Examination, and instructed the government to revert to the previous normalisation method.\nWhile some students of the State Board challenged the High Court judgment in the Supreme Court, the State government decided against going in appeal, considering time constraints to complete the admission process.\nIn a statement, Dr. Bindu said the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) guidelines mandated that all admission procedures be completed by August 14. The State government, therefore informed the Supreme Court that a minimum of 30 days is required to complete the option registration and allotment process.\nThe State also informed the apex court that the government is willing to appeal against the High Court’s verdict, “which affected the implementation of the revised prospectus”, if the AICTE is open to modifying the current admission deadline.\nDr. Bindu reiterated that the government had proposed to implement the revised mark normalisation process to ensure justice for all students. The reforms were intended to rectify disparities and were accordingly incorporated into the amended prospectus, she said."

    "content": "The Kerala State Medical Council (Council of Modern Medicine) has decided to remove the name of a  registered medical practitioner from the State Medical Register for a period of three months and has imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh, for practising with unrecognised and unregistered qualifications, ignoring prior warnings and repeated directives of the council.\nThis is the second instance in recent times of the KSMC cracking the whip to ensure that all registered medical practitioners follow the ethical guidelines of professional conduct regulating the practice of medicine.\nThe complaint that Collin Alphonse, a registered medical practitioner in Thiruvananthapuram, was displaying unrecognised and unregistered additional qualifications while in clinical practice was received by the council in 2022. The Ethics Committee of the Modern Medicine Council had summoned Dr. Alphonse on June 14, 2022 for a personal hearing.\nDuring the hearing, the doctor said that though he had appeared for the DNB (Medicine) examination after training from 2007 to 2010, the result was not declared. He claimed that he obtained an MD in Medicine in 2016 and a PhD in Medicine in 2019 from Nicaragua, Central America. He claimed to have applied for an equivalency certificate from the National Medical Commission (NMC) and that the registration process had been initiated with the NMC.\nDr. Alphonse said he had  been practising at Jubilee Memorial Hospital since 2019 and asserted that he was unaware that unregistered qualifications should not be displayed for medical practice. He gave an undertaking to the council of corrective action and also tendered an apology.\nThe Ethics Committee, however, found that the claim that Dr. Alphonse had applied for an equivalency certificate was misleading, as the NMC does not issue such a certificate. The degrees displayed by Dr. Alphonse were not listed as NMC’s recognised qualifications and he had practised for three years using these qualifications.\nThe council imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on Dr. Alphonse and directed him to remove the unregistered qualifications from his name board, official seal, and prescription pads, and to submit documentary proof to the council.\nHowever, except for paying the fine of ₹50,000, Dr. Alphonse refused to comply with the rest of the directives, even after a reminder was sent to him. On February 22 this year, the KSMC, during a surprise inspection at Jubilee Memorial Hospital, found that Dr. Alphonse was continuing to practice, displaying the qualifications, MD (Medicine), PG in Diabetology, and FCCM (Critical Care in FC).\nThe council then issued a show cause notice to him, directing him to appear before the council. In his appearance on June 21, Dr. Alphonse blamed the hospital administration for including the qualifications on the board placed outside his consulting room.\nHe said that upon receiving the show cause notice he had instructed the hospital authorities to remove the unregistered qualifications from the name board. Dr. Alphonse, however, admitted that he was using the same qualifications in other areas  where he had clinical practice, “thinking that the instructions by the council applied only to the practice at Jubilee Memorial Hospital”.\nThe council, however, held Dr. Alphonse accountable  for repeatedly ignoring its directives and continuing his unauthorised practice even though he had paid a penalty for the same offence in 2022.\nThe KSMC on July 3, decided to remove his name from the State Medical Register for three months, noting that he had neglected his  professional responsibility to ensure accurate and lawful public representation. Dr. Alphonse was also directed to implement corrective measures; not to display unregistered qualifications and not to claim to be a specialist till he was duly qualified to do so.\nThe doctor has the right to appeal before the Ethics and Medical Registration Board of the National Medical Commission as per Section 30(3) of the NMC Act, 2019, and as per Clause 8.8 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002."

However, the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Cheetah Project Steering Committee will decide when the animals will be brought here,\" he said.\nMr. Singh said a 600-hectare enclosure has been developed, the herbivore population has been increased, and facilities such as CCTV monitoring and a dedicated veterinary centre have been established.\nFences have been installed to prevent the infiltration of other large carnivores into the cheetah enclosures. Veterinarians have also been trained at Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park, the first site in India to host cheetahs translocated from Africa, he added.\nAccording to the plan to introduce cheetahs in the Banni Grasslands, the natural habitat preferences of cheetahs in Africa include grasslands, savannahs and scrublands, and the habitat conditions in Banni closely match these.\nVantara, a Jamnagar-based rescue, conservation and rehabilitation facility of the Reliance Foundation, posted on Instagram that in collaboration with the Gujarat Forest Department, it has reintroduced spotted deer into the Banni Grasslands.\n\"The introduction of spotted deer marks a key step in restoring ecological balance in Banni. As a committed partner, Vantara supports this effort with scientific expertise, veterinary care and technical support, working alongside the government to protect India's natural heritage,\" it said.\nMr. Singh said the move is part of broader efforts to increase the prey population in the arid grassland landscape.\nOfficials said that cheetahs are likely to be introduced in the Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh before they are sent to the Bunni Grasslands.\nThe State government officially declared Veerangana Durgavati a tiger reserve in September 2023. Located about 20 kilometres from Bhopal, it spans 2,339 square kilometres and covers parts of Narsinghpur, Sagar and Damoh districts.\nAn NTCA team reviewed the preparations in the tiger reserve in June.\nThereafter, officials said, cheetahs will be introduced into the Bunni grasslands in Gujarat's Kutch district and then in the Shahgarh Bulge region in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan.\nThe 10 potential sites listed in the action plan for cheetah introduction are: Guru Ghasidas National Park in Chhattisgarh; Banni grasslands in Gujarat; Dubri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sanjay National Park, Bagdara Wildlife Sanctuary, Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary (now Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve) and Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh; Desert National Park and Shahgarh grasslands in Rajasthan and Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.\nSeventy years after cheetahs went extinct in India, the government launched the Project Cheetah to establish a sustainable population of the big cat in the country.\nAs part of the reintroduction effort, 20 African cheetahs were brought to Kuno National Park: eight from Namibia in September 2022 and 12 from South Africa in February 2023. Eleven of them have survived, including two that were transferred to Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary in April.\nSince the introduction of African cheetahs, 26 cubs have been born in India, of which 17 have survived."

Many crucial processes performed by the university, including the issue of equivalency certificates that are essential for student admissions, have come to a standstill.\nThere are reports that the mark lists of various examinations and files relating to the recognition or approval  of academic courses in affiliated colleges, the career advancement schemes for teachers, and that of additional Plan funds are all held up in various sections, which calls for urgent crisis resolution.\nThe government should remember that the petty power politics, violent protests and the escalating crisis in Kerala University and the higher education sector is affecting the academic prospects of students, Mr. Satheesan said.\nHe requested Mr. Vijayan to intervene in the matter urgently."

    "content": "Senior citizens in the Nilgiris have called for better accessibility to government offices, particularly the office of the Revenue Divisional Officers (RDOs) in Udhagamandalam and Coonoor, where grievances of senior citizens are heard.\nAccording to local residents who have visited the offices, both offices, where senior citizens’ tribunals are held, lack basic facilities for senior citizens, such as wheelchairs and disability-friendly ramps and stairs. D. Subbaiah, a resident of HPF in Udhagamandalam, aged 92, said he had approached the office of the Ooty RDO, first in November of last year, seeking help from the RDO to mediate between himself and one of his children for the construction of a toilet on his land. Mr. Subbaiah said that not only was accessing the office difficult, as it was located atop a hill along Hospital Road in Udhagamandalam, he was also made to wait six hours in the rain for his petition to be heard as the RDO was unavailable.\n“Moreover, the RDO himself rarely listens to our grievances, which are instead heard by clerical staff in his office. When we approach the appelate authority, who is the collector, we are treated very poorly by her clerical staff as well,” alleged Mr. Subbaiah, stating that in most cases, their grievances are not escalated to the collector or the RDO by the staff.\nVisitors to the RDO office in Coonoor too have similar complaints. A. Baby, 76, who lives in Balocola with her sister, said that she had wanted the RDO to intervene in receiving maintenance allowance from her brother.\nShe said that she was denied permission to meet the RDO and the collector on a number of occasions. A. Saroja, her sister, and a principal of a school in the Nilgiris, said that the procedure to assist senior citizens was designed in such a way as to discourage people from demanding their rights as per the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. “When I was helping my sister in drafting her petition at the collector’s office, I was told to step out of the office even when I informed them that she was illiterate,” alleged Ms. Saroja.\nK. Vijayan, a senior lawyer and Director of the People’s Legal Forum (Tamil Nadu Chapter), toldThe Hinduthat accessibility was an important issue, especially in a topographically challenging district such as the Nilgiris, where senior citizens and people with disabilities face even more challenges in accessing government services due to a lack of mobility. “The government needs to ensure that these offices are made accessible with wheelchairs and offices that are disabled-friendly. They could also consider delegating one official who will be present at all times to consider and help with drafting the petitions of senior citizens and persons with disabilities,” he said.\nWhen contacted, Revenue Divisional Officer (Udhagamandalam), S. Satheesh, said that it was unfortunate that the building in which his office is located was atop a steep incline. He said that no senior citizens are made to walk up to his office and that he receives them all on the ground floor itself. “We also have a dedicated day, each Thursday, where senior citizens and persons with disabilities have their grievances heard. They are also offered assistance by the District Legal Services Authority,” he added, stating that the district administration was working hard to ensure that the grievances of senior citizens are solved in a time-bound manner."

The bugs have been found in fields undergoing second season paddy cultivation, around 25 days after sowing.\nThe KCPM warns that the black bug, which sucks sap from plants, could damage crops and urges farmers to remain vigilant. The pest is typically found on leaves. It is also seen in the soil or at the base of plants. It injures leaves and midribs, causing leaves to tear off and midribs to wilt.\nWounds caused by the black bug might also facilitate the spread of bacteria responsible for leaf blight. In cases of severe infestation, symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and wilting of midribs might appear.\nOfficials suggest controlled flooding of fields to help destroy the pests. “If water is flooded to the extent that the base of the plants is submerged, the bugs will climb upwards. This prevents them from sucking sap from the lower parts of the plant. Furthermore, if the lower leaves remain submerged for more than six hours, the egg clusters laid on them will be destroyed. The bugs that climb upward will be eaten by birds and other natural predators. Predatory insects such as tortoise beetles also feed on and destroy egg clusters,” says an official.\nThe bug population usually increases in the days following the full moon. Officials say that insecticide application could be carried out in severely affected areas. “If large numbers of pests are found and symptoms appear on paddy plants, insecticides can be applied as per technical advice,” the official adds.\nIn fields practising organic farming, Azadirachtin 1500 PPM can be sprayed at the rate of one litre per acre. The pest population can also be controlled by applying biocontrol agents such as Metarhizium and Beauveria.\nIf the use of chemical insecticides is required, granular formulations are recommended. Granules can be applied along with chemical fertilisers. To ensure better results, optimum soil moisture should be maintained during application.\nFor more details, farmers could contact the following phone numbers: 8547865338 (Nedumudi), 9074306585 (Punnapra), 9961392082 (Kainakary) and 9567819958 (Champakulam)."

    "content": "Observing that what could be divine music to the ears of some might actually turn out to be a nuisance for others, the Madras High Court on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) restrained the use of a residential house for the recitation ofNama Sankeerthanam(congregational chanting of the names of Hindu Gods) unless the Collector grants permission for using the premises as a prayer hall.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh said, the law should apply equally to all, and that no religious group could use such premises for congregational prayers without the Collector’s nod. “Peace is the best prayer and silence is the greatest prayer. The day people realise this truth, they will not disturb others by indulging in loud and noisy ways of praying to God,” the judge said.\nThe observations were made during the hearing of a writ petition filed by Prakash Ramachandran of Krishnamachari Street at Radha Nagar in Chromepet, Chengalpattu district. The petitioner had complained that a private organisation named Global Organisation for Divinity (GOD) had opened its office on the residential premises belonging to his neighbour T.S. Subramanian.\nThe petitioner had complained ofNama Sankeerthanambeing recited on the premises, causing disturbance to other residents of the locality. However, the private respondents filed a counter affidavit claiming they had the consent of all the other neighbours for the recitation and that their religious rights had been safeguarded under Article 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution.\nThe private respondents also contended that uttering the names of Gods would only help in bringing peace of mind and serve as a remedy for all troubles and sorrows. However, the judge said, any prayer should remain confined within the four walls of a house and not end up causing disturbance to others. He also said, it was not necessary for all the residents in a locality to come to the court complaining about disturbance.\nReferring to an order passed by him restraining the use of residential houses for Christian congregational prayers in Kanniyakumari district without obtaining the Collector’s nod, the judge told the respondents’ counsel: “The same will apply here too. Except the change in the name of God, all other things are the same. How can you haveNama Sankeerthanamwithout Collector’s nod?”\nWhen the counsel stated her clients had already made a representation to the Chengalpattu Collector seeking permission, the judge ordered the recitation must not take place in the residential locality until the Collector grants permission and directed the Inspector of Chitlapakkam police station to ensure the court order was complied with in letter and spirit."

    "content": "From serving tea and noodles at a roadside stall to dreaming of summiting the highest peaks across all seven continents, Meghalaya’s Rifiness Warjri is charting a path of grit and grace.\nThe 20-year-old mountaineer recently etched her name in history as the youngest person from the state to conquer Mount Everest. But even with this extraordinary feat, Rifiness remains deeply rooted in her humble beginnings.\nIn an interview withPTI, Rifiness stood proud, yet grounded, as she shared her dreams of scaling the tallest mountains on every continent.\nHer journey has captured the hearts of many — not just for her physical endurance and mental strength but also for the humility and warmth she continues to carry. Eyeing the prestigious seven summits challenge, Rifiness hopes her path will inspire countless other women from struggling working-class families in small towns and marginalised communities to chase big dreams.\nBorn in Nongthymmai but now residing in the Laitkor area of the East Khasi Hills district on the outskirts of Shillong, Rifiness comes from a modest, hard-working family. Her mother runs a small roadside tea stall while her father sells chicken to support the family.\nDespite the national and international recognition she now receives, Rifiness is still often seen helping out at the family stall, wiping tables, serving tea, and chatting with customers, just as she always did.\n“It’s my home. My roots keep me grounded… the mountains teach us humility. When I stood atop Everest, I realised how small and insignificant we are. That was one lesson I brought back and I am sharing with everyone,” she said.\nDespite being a man of few words, her father Shlurbor Kharmyndai could not hide his pride.\n“It’s a proud moment for us. I wish that she secures a government job as soon as possible so that she can support the family as well, but I also do not want her to stop dreaming. She is free to fly big,” he said.\nHer elder sister, Noury, who co-manages the family tea stall, also spoke with emotion.\n“God has been kind to our family,” she said, smiling as she handed a cup of tea to a customer.\nAlso read:Hyderabad’s Vishwanath Karthikey Padakanti, the Youngest Indian to complete 7 Summits challenge\n“Seeing my sister reach the top of the world is like a dream come true. She worked so hard and deserves all this love and respect,” she added.\nThe Warjri family maintains a strong and loving bond. After the day’s work, they gather at home to share simple meals and talk about their day. Their evenings are often filled with laughter and music, with Rifiness and her sister strumming their ukuleles, singing soft melodies that echo through their home.\nRifiness’ journey to Everest was anything but easy. Meghalaya, though rich in natural beauty, lacks mountaineering infrastructure and organised support for adventure sports.\nSponsorship and funding are limited, especially for athletes, and mountaineering is not a popular sport in the state. But with unshakeable determination, intense training, and the emotional strength drawn from her family, Rifiness overcame every obstacle placed in her path.\n“I want to show young people, especially girls, that we can dream big and make it happen — even if we start small,” she said.\nFor children from disadvantaged families, she gave a message: “Your background should never limit your ambition. Believe in yourself and keep going.” Her climb has earned her recognition from across the nation. Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma felicitated her with cash rewards and acknowledged the significance of her journey for the state’s youth.\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh called her a shining example of India’s resilient young generation.\nThe Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) also honoured her after she symbolically handed over a piece of rock she carried back from Everest, connecting her triumph with the land and people she represents.\nBeyond the symbolic moments and celebratory ceremonies, Rifiness's aspirations are only just beginning. She dreams of continuing her mountaineering journey, aiming to conquer the seven summits, climbing the highest peaks on every continent, including Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Vinson Massif in Antarctica.\nEach climb will come with its own set of challenges, but Rifiness is no stranger to hardships.\n“I hope someday I will summit all these peaks, but right now I want to complete my BSc, which was stalled due to the training and travelling last year,” she added."

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) said the upcoming State Assembly elections would mark a permanent farewell to AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami, alleging that even members of his own party no longer trust him.\nMr. Stalin made the remarks while launching and inaugurating completed development projects and distributing welfare assistance in Mayiladuthurai district, during which he expressed criticism of both the AIADMK and BJP-led Union government.\nResponding to Mr. Palaniswami’s criticism of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, Mr. Stalin said, “He is unable to accept the scheme’s success. His criticisms only serve to advertise our achievements. We implement this scheme without bias; even women from AIADMK families benefit.”\nHe accused Mr. Palaniswami of reversing welfare progress during his tenure, pointing to the cancellation of the Moovalur Ramamirtham marriage assistance scheme and the free laptop distribution programme. “Mr. Palaniswami says ‘Tata, bye bye’ to me. But since 2019, the people of Tamil Nadu have been saying the same to him. In the upcoming elections, it will be a permanent goodbye,” Mr. Stalin remarked. “Even his own party cadres no longer believe in him.”\nTaking aim at Mr. Palaniswami’s outreach to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Stalin alleged, that the AIADMK leader had knocked on Delhi’s doors not for the people of Tamil Nadu but to escape raids and protect his family. “He mortgaged a party built by lakhs of cadre,” Mr. Stalin alleged.\nOn the issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen’s frequent arrests by Sri Lankan authorities, Mr. Stalin criticised the Union government for political inaction. “The BJP-led Union government has failed to act, while continuing to politicise the Katchatheevu issue. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister clearly said the Tamil Nadu fishermen are intruding into their waters and that Katchatheevu will never be returned. And what has our External Affairs Minister said in response? Nothing.” Mr. Stalin reiterated his demand for the Prime Minister to directly intervene and bring a lasting solution to the issue.\nMr. Stalin declared that the next government at the Centre would be a “Dravidian Model 2.0 government”, one that would serve as a national benchmark for inclusive and progressive governance.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Stalin unveiled a statue of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Vazhuvur village in Kuthalam taluk. He also held a brief roadshow near Dharmapuram, where he greeted school and college students as well as members of the general public."

    "content": "The sixth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB), organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation (KBF), will be titled ‘For the Time Being.’\nCurated by artist Nikhil Chopra with HH Art Spaces, a Goa-based artist-led organisation, the biennale will run for 110 days, from December 12, 2025, through March 31, 2026.\nThe KBF also announced the curatorial framework for KMB ‘25. Alongside the international exhibition, the biennale will feature a diverse programme of talks, performances, workshops, and film screenings, unfolding across various sites in Kochi. Key programme verticals include the Students’ Biennale, Invitations, Art By Children, the Residency Programme and the Collateral.\nThe curatorial note by Nikhil Chopra states that the sixth edition of the KMB will embrace process as methodology and position ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition.\nMoving away from the conventional biennale model of a singular, central exhibition event, the sixth edition is envisioned as a living ecosystem “one where each element shares space, time, and resources, and grows in dialogue with each other,” a release issued here said.\nKBF Chair V. Venu said the biennale, over its past editions, has consistently risen in stature, attracting artworks from both celebrated and emerging talents from India and abroad.\n“Organising such an event needs meticulous planning and strategies. We have introduced important organisational changes in the Kochi Biennale Foundation and we are confident to make a grand success of the sixth edition of the biennale. For both commoners and connoisseurs, it will offer a dynamic experience,” he was quoted as saying in the release.\nBose Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, said that Nikhil Chopra’s emphasis on durational exhibitions and performances will be a highlight of the sixth edition. “Those visiting the biennale will be introduced to an immersive atmosphere, featuring spectacular artworks and site-responsive installations. The event will also offer abundant opportunities to engage with artists and fellow art enthusiasts, and witness the layered cultural life of Kochi, a city where global and local currents converge and diverge all at once,” he said."

    "content": "CongressMP and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok SabhaRahul Gandhi, on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), saidAssamChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma will be in jail for “stealing people’s lands” and “large-scale corruption” after theBharatiya Janata Party(BJP) loses theState polls in 2026.\nAddressing a party rally at Chhaygaon, about 40 km southwest of Guwahati, he said the Congress would sweep the elections because of the BJP’s “politics of hate and violence”, and the groundwork done by theState party president Gaurav Gogoiand his team.\n“Soon, the media will show your Chief Minister going to jail and neither (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi nor (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah can save him,” Mr. Gandhi said.\n“When you go home and see him (Mr. Sarma) on TV, observe his eyes. They convey fear from the depths of his heart because he knows the Congress will put him in jail. He knows he will be answerable for the corruption he and his family have indulged in,” he said.\nReferring to a series of eviction drives across the State, Mr. Gandhi said the youth, farmers, and daily wage earners of Assam wanted to see the Chief Minister behind bars because “they know he is corrupt, and steals land from the people 24 hours a day for a solar park or resort”.\nThousands of acres of land had been taken from the poor, and farmers were being given to “Adani, Ambani, Ramdev” under one pretext or another, he said. “India’s forest, air, water, and land are being sold to five-six industrialists,” he added.\nMr. Gandhi also cautioned the people against possible manipulation of the electoral rolls ahead of theAssam election. “The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Election Commission of India are working in tandem to change laws and tamper with the voters’ list. They did it in Maharashtra, where one crore voters were added in four months; they are doing it in Bihar with the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls; they will do it in Assam,” he said.\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge also took a swipe at Mr. Sarma and exuded hope that the grand old party would return to power in Assam.\nRahul Gandhi wants to protect communal elements, alleges Himanta\nRahul terms Himanta Biswa ‘the most corrupt Chief Minister’ in the country\nHimanta Biswa Sarma, Rahul Gandhi spar; Assam Chief Minister warns Congress leader of arrest after polls\nEarlier, Mr. Gogoi said Mr. Sarma was acting like a “real estate broker” and engaging in large-scale land transfers to industrialists from outside the State. “The Chief Minister and his colleagues are dispossessing the poor and the marginalised. The Congress party in Assam will fight for justice for every citizen suffering under a regime of fear and terror,” he said.\nThe Assam Chief Minister hit back at Mr. Gandhi and his party colleagues. “He came all the way to Assam just to say this (jail for graft), conveniently forgetting that he himself is out on bail in multiple criminal cases registered across the country,” he wrote on social media platform X.\nA former Congress leader, Mr. Sarma has frequently engaged in a war of words with Mr. Gandhi since joining the BJP in 2015."

The government should not allow capitalists and corporate houses to acquire farmland, he said.\nThe Dharwad district committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), according to a press release from district secretary of the party Mahesh Pattar, has welcomed the State government’s decision on quashing the land acquisition notification pertaining to Devanahalli and thanked all the organisations that stood with the farmers in taking their fight against forcible land acquisition to a logical end.\nThe CPI(M) also thanked Samyukta Horata, Karnataka for providing the required force to the agitation to exert more pressure on the government.

We live in a parliamentary democracy where coordination between the State and the Centre is crucial for development.

I had requested the Centre then to consider it under the Sagarmala project as the estimated cost was ₹480 to ₹520 crore.

Palaniswami, alleging that even members of his own party no longer trust him.\nMr. Stalin made the remarks while launching andinaugurating completed development projects and distributing welfare assistance in Mayiladuthurai district, during which he expressed criticism of both the AIADMK and BJP-led Union government.\nResponding to Mr. Palaniswami’s criticism of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, Mr. Stalin said, “He is unable to accept the scheme’s success. His criticisms only serve to advertise our achievements. We implement this scheme without bias; even women from AIADMK families benefit.”\nHe accused Mr. Palaniswami of reversing welfare progress during his tenure, pointing to the cancellation of the Moovalur Ramamirtham marriage assistance scheme and the free laptop distribution programme. “Mr. Palaniswami says ‘Tata, bye bye’ to me. But since 2019, the people of Tamil Nadu have been saying the same to him. In the upcoming elections, it will be a permanent goodbye,” Mr. Stalin remarked. “Even his own party cadres no longer believe in him.”\nTaking aim at Mr. Palaniswami’s outreach to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Stalin alleged, that the AIADMK leader had knocked on Delhi’s doors not for the people of Tamil Nadu but to escape raids and protect his family. “He mortgaged a party built by lakhs of cadre,” Mr. Stalin alleged.\nOn the issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen’s frequent arrests by Sri Lankan authorities, Mr. Stalin criticised the Union government for political inaction. “The BJP-led Union government has failed to act, while continuing to politicise the Katchatheevu issue. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister clearly said the Tamil Nadu fishermen are intruding into their waters and that Katchatheevu will never be returned. And what has our External Affairs Minister said in response? Nothing.” Mr. Stalin reiterated his demand for the Prime Minister to directly intervene and bring a lasting solution to the issue.\nMr. Stalin declared that the next government at the Centre would be a “Dravidian Model 2.0 government”, one that would serve as a national benchmark for inclusive and progressive governance.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Stalin unveiled a statue of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Vazhuvur village in Kuthalam taluk. He also held a brief roadshow near Dharmapuram, where he greeted school and college students as well as members of the general public."

Madhav has asserted that the coalition NDA government in Andhra Pradesh will fulfill its mandate, with due focus on maintaining a fine balance between welfare and development, and is not averse to making the necessary course corrections, lest the people should lose confidence in it.\nIn a chit chat with print media journalists here on Wednesday, Mr. Madhav noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was extending all support to the State and wanted it to be mindful of the limited time at its disposal to implement what had been promised at the time of elections.\nMr. Madhav said the country was making rapid strides under Mr. Modi’s leadership, and it had a tremendous impact on Andhra Pradesh. This was evident from the manner in which the State recovered to a large extent from the misdeeds of the previous YSRCP government.\nWhile Mr. Modi extended the desired hand-holding (to AP), Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu managed to undo the damage that had been done by the YSRCP, one step at a time. Mr. Madhav expressed confidence that the State would undergo an unprecedented change in the remaining four years, as the TDP, BJP, and Jana Sena Party were making sincere efforts to achieve the purpose of their alliance.\nThe alliance was ridiculed by the YSRCP and some other parties for obvious reasons when it was forged, but the three ruling parties had set that mockery apart and were glued to the task on hand, which was to make Andhra Pradesh a progressive State, wherein a fair bit of success was achieved in the one year that passed by.\nThe State BJP chief further said the response to the coalition government’s style of functioning was evoking positive response from the public, but it was not taking things lightly as admiration could within no time turn into disenchantment if the parties failed to keep their promises.\nTherefore, the BJP, TDP and JSP were leaving no stone unturned to live up to the people’s expectations and gave priority to creating employment opportunities, which was one of the basic things for any political party to do. To achieve this, emphasis had been laid on attracting investments and the results were there for everyone to see.\nOn the political front, Mr. Madhav said, while following the coalition dharma, the BJP was building the organisational strength required to singly take on its rivals in the future.\nAdoni MLA Valmiki Parthasarathi, BJP State general secretary S. Dayakar Reddy, secretary N. Ramesh Naidu, NTR District president A. Sriram, and party leaders U. Srinivas Raju and M. Venkata Subbaiah was present."

    "content": "The State government has accorded administrative sanction to set up a ₹10-crore ring-fenced account for the restoration of the Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes, designated as Ramsar sites, for their ecological importance.\nThe move comes as a follow up to the ₹10-crore penalty imposed on the government by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal in March 2023 for its failure to check the indiscriminate pollution of the Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes.\nThe tribunal had directed the government to ring-fence an amount of ₹10 crore for undertaking conservation and restoration activities in the Vembanad and Ashtamudi wetlands. The drawing and disbursing officer of the Department of Local Self-Government has taken necessary steps to transfer the money to the specified account, said a government order dated July 9, 2025.\nOf the ₹10-crore fund, about ₹2.39 crore will be disbursed for projects under the Suchitwa Keralam (Rural) implemented by local bodies in the Ashtamudi–Vembanad wetland region as per the list furnished by the Executive Director, Suchitwa Mission. The remaining fund will be used for the biomining of legacy waste implemented by the Kochi Corporation in Brahmapuram, it said.\nThe tribunal had stated in its order dated March 22, 2023 that the environment compensation of ₹10 crore had to be utilised for conservation/restoration measures by preparing an action plan to be preferably executed within six months.\nIt would be open to the Chief Secretary to collect the amount from erring officers/departments/industries/ individuals in accordance with the law by an appropriate mechanism and hold erring officers appropriately accountable departmentally or by way of prosecution and also to proceed against other entities, railways, local bodies, and industries (responsible for the pollution) within three months, it said.\nThe penalty was imposed on the basis of the ‘polluter pays principle’ after the Bench observed that action taken at the State-level was also inadequate to remedy the situation. The State cannot plead helplessness in implementing guaranteed rights of the citizens and also in taking stringent measures for protection of environment and public health, it said."

The number of voters per booth needs to be revised from from 1,300 to 1,100 in the panchayats and from 1,600 to 1,300 in municipalities. Since each voter has to cast three votes, large numbers of voters per booth would create problems, Mr. Satheesan said.\nThere are also complaints that, even after delimitation, voters would be forced to travel more than eight km to access polling booths. The Commission should make arrangements for multiple booths in such locations, he said.\nThe UDF also demanded the Commission to rectify anomalies and guideline violations in the draft notifications on ward delimitation in local bodies."

Kote, T. Narasipur, and Periyapatna, a few months ago, the Minister added.\n“The Opposition claims the State has no money for development. If that is the case, how are these works being taken up? I can provide documents on the projects implemented and the amount spent,” he asserted.\nDr. Mahadevappa said no other government has brought such large-scale development, particularly to Mysuru city. “It is Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who has sanctioned maximum funds for the region,” he maintained.\nKey projects listed for the launch and laying foundation stones include ₹502 crore for white-topping and other works under PWD; ₹419 crore for an irrigation project at Heggadanahalli; ₹408 crore for underground electricity cabling by CESC; ₹330 crore for UGD works under Mysuru City Corporation; ₹192 crore for the Unity Mall at the exhibition grounds (State is providing only land to the Centre for the work), and ₹100 crore for new facilities at Mysore Medical College.\nHe said AICC president Mallikarjuna Kharge has been invited to the Samavesha.\nOn expanding K.R. Hospital with sharp increase in patient load, Dr. Mahadevappa said vertical development is possible only if building bylaws are altered, since high-rise structures are not permitted in the vicinity of the palace. “The bylaws are under consideration,” he replied.\nHe also acknowledged the increasing patient load at Jayadeva Institute in Mysuru, attributing it to lifestyle changes leading to rising health issues. The expansion of the facility will also be looked into, he added.\nFormer Minister and MLA Tanveer Sait, MLA K. Harish Gowda, Deputy Commissioner G. Lakshmikanth Reddy, Police Commissioner Seema Latkar, DCPs Sundar Raj and Bindu Rani, and local Congress leaders were present.\nEarlier, the Minister inspected the venue and spoke to the officials on the arrangements.\nDr. Mahadevappa said nearly one lakh people are expected to attend the event."

The Union Heavy Industries Minister is Sh. Kumaraswamy. They sold 160 acres earlier. On the remaining 280 Acres, the Karnataka Govt and Forest Department want to make a “Biodiversity Park”, like Cubbon Park, which will be a second set of lungs for Bengaluru,” he said.\nThe Congress leader alleged that the Modi government and Kumaraswamy want to sell these 280 acres of land for “real estate development”.\n“The Govt of Karnataka and the Modi Govt are fighting it out in Supreme Court and the matter is now listed for July. While Congress Govt of the State wants Bio-Diversity Park like the Cubbon Park, BJP-Janata Dal want real estate development,” he claimed in the post.\nHe questioned why the Modi government and Union Minister Kumaraswamy are obstructing and opposing creating a Bio-Diversity Park in the heart of Bengaluru.\n“For BJP-Janata Dal, is making money out of real estate more important than Green Cover and fresh air for people of Bengaluru? When land was given for factory in the 1960’s and HMT is shut down years ago, why should this land be not returned to People of Karnataka for a Bio-Diversity Park? Does this not expose the hypocrisy of Modi Govt and bring out the sinister nexus of BJP-Janata Dal?,” he asked."

But if any illegality is found, action will be taken, he said.\nOn the supply of fertilisers, he said that the Centre is not supplying adequate quantity of urea to the State as there is huge demand because of copious rainfall.\n“Already, four cases have been filed against supply of poor quality fertiliser. Their licence has been cancelled and steps will be taken to arrest sellers of spurious fertiliser,” he said.\nReplying to a query, Medical Education Minister Sharanprakash Patil clarified that there has been no increase in the number of deaths due to heart attacks in the last six months. “People have been given wrong information.

Saseendran has announced that the State will soon launch a project in collaboration with the Health Department to produce snake antivenom locally.\nInaugurating the World Snake Day observance here on Wednesday, he said the antivenom at present used in Kerala was sourced from Tamil Nadu. “Studies have shown that the potency of snake venom can vary from region to region due to atmospheric differences. As a result, antivenoms may not neutralise the venom of the same species found in different regions. Hence, locally produced antivenom is essential for effective treatment,” he said, emphasising the importance of region-specific antivenom.\nPointing out that between 82,000 and 1.35 lakh people die from snakebites globally every year, the Minister said nearly half of those deaths occurred in India. “Kerala has historically reported high snakebite fatality rates.”\n“However, efforts by the Forest department and the introduction of the SARPA (Snake Awareness, Rescue and Protection App) mobile application have significantly brought down the number of deaths. From 119 reported deaths in 2019, the figure dropped to 30 in 2024. The State aims to achieve zero deaths due to snakebites by 2030 as part of the Snake Envenomation Zero Mortality Kerala project,” Mr. Saseendran stated.\nHead of Forest Force Rajesh Ravindran presided over the programme. Chief Wildlife Warden Pramod G. Krishnan also spoke on the occasion."

The unions aired their views on the penultimate day of the public hearings organised by the commission on the draft.\nOver 70% of the solar power generated during daytime was being exported to the grid by prosumers, they said. The cost of having to accommodate this excess energy plays havoc with the KSEB’s scheduled power agreements and finances. A situation has now arisen where the gains made by the prosumer population of around 2 lakh are coming at the expense of the entire 1.4 crore electricity consumers of the KSEB, they said.\nThe unions welcomed the proposal to limit the net metering system to 3 kW, but called for more studies on new technologies such as peer-to-peer trading (P2P).\nObserving that Kerala’s solar capacity has grown by 275% over the past two years, the Left-backed KSEB Officers’ Association (KSEBOA) welcomed the commission’s efforts to encourage energy storage systems through the draft regulations.\nWelcoming the draft proposals, the KSEB Workers’ Association, affiliated to the CITU, called for constructive solutions to balance the requirements of the prosumers and ordinary consumers of the KSEB. The association, however, pointed out that there is a need to correct the propaganda that the draft is against the prosumers.\nThe Kerala Power Board Officers Federation and  the INTUC-backed Kerala Electricity Employees Confederation said urgent measures are needed to address the challenges posed by excess injection of solar power into the grid. At the same time, the new investors in the renewable energy sector needs to be encouraged.\nA demand was also made at the hearing that the commission set a ceiling on the cost of installing solar plants.\nThe series of public hearings held by the commission on the draft will conclude on Thursday."

    "content": "Traffic was disrupted at Aram Mile on the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway on Wednesday for nearly two hours after a tree fell on the road around 6 a.m. According to local people, the traffic was resumed after Fire and Rescue Services personnel removed the tree.\nLast week, the Kerala High Court issued an order restricting road-widening works and tree felling on the 14.5-km Neriamangalam-Valara-Adimaly stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway following a petition filed by Idukki-based environmentalist M.N. Jayachandran.\nDias Pullan, convener of the Idukki Land Freedom Movement, said that the people in the area had formed a National Highway Protection Council to provide immediate assistance in clearing traffic blocks caused by fallen trees and other issues. “Usually when the group comes to know about fallen  trees on the road, its members immediately rush to the site to clear the road. But after the court order, they have refused to join the initiative and the traffic on the stretch was disrupted for nearly two hours on Wednesday. People fear that if they remove fallen trees from the area, the Forest department will register cases against them,” said Mr. Pullan.\nIdukki Land Freedom Movement general convener Rasak Chooravelil said that in June, following an order issued by the Idukki District Collector, a team comprising the Valara Forest Range Officer and the National Highways Authority of India officials had identified 682 trees and two bamboo groves on the 14.5-km stretch that posed threat to passengers. Around 240 trees on the stretch had already been felled. However, after the High Court order, the tree-felling initiatives faced a hurdle. Repeated incidents of trees falling on the stretch pose a major threat to motorists on the Neriamangalam-Valara stretch,” said Mr. Chooravelil.\nMeanwhile, the National Highway Protection Council has decided to take out a long march from the premises of the Aram Mile forest station to the Neriamangalam forest range office on July 31 demanding an end to the “illegal interventions by the Forest department that hinder the widening of the highway.”\nAccording to organisers, various farmers’ groups and people’s movements will join the protest march."

Chandrababu Naidu was misusing power to harass the opposition party leaders and cadre.\nHe alleged that the DIGs in the State were indulging in corruption on behalf of the ruling dispensation. “Certain DIGs and police officers are behaving like mafia dons, collecting bribes from illegal liquor and sand operations, and sharing the proceeds with ruling party leaders,” the YSRCP chief alleged.\nHe accused the NDA government of resorting to authoritarian governance, misuse of police machinery, and suppression of opposition party leaders.\n“The YSRCP is the only party consistently responding to public grievances,” he said, and claimed that the remained the sole voice actively questioning the failure in delivering promises made by Mr. Naidu.\nMr. Naidu, having lost public trust, was misusing police powers to suppress dissent, he alleged. The government filed false cases against senior IPS officers such as P.S.R. Anjaneyulu, Sunil Kumar and Kanti Rana Tata, the former Chief Minister alleged.\n“Over 80 inspectors and hundreds of constables remain suspended or sidelined, while only pro-TDP officers are being empowered,” he said, and cited the resignation of IPS officer Siddharth Kaushal as an example of the “unbearable pressure being exerted by the government on honest officers.”\nCondemning the attack on Krishna ZP chairperson Uppala Harika allegedly by TDP workers while she was on her way to attend the ‘Recalling Chandrababu’s Manifesto’ programme, he said despite police presence, the mob attacked and hurled stones at her car. “Shockingly, no arrests have been made. A false case has been filed against her husband,” he said.\nMr. Jagan Mohan Reddy listed instances wherein false FIRs had been registered against the YSRCP leaders during his visits to mirchi yard and mango market, and condolence meeting in the recent past.\nHe questioned why raising public issues was being treated as a crime under the current regime. Despite borrowing ₹1.75 lakh crore in 14 months, the government failed to implement a single major welfare scheme, he alleged.\nReacting to cases filed on leaders and cadre who uttered controversial film dialogues, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy observed that there was nothing wrong in using film dialogues and expressions. “If they are so objectionable, then why did the Board of Film Certification allow such dialogues and expressions, and why did the film maker produce such movies? Let them stop it there itself,” he said."

    "content": "BJP MLA and former Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj is among five persons booked for the murder of a rowdy sheeter and realtor in Bengaluru on Wednesday.\nThe FIR was registered based on a complaint by Vijayalakshmi, the mother of the deceased, who reportedly witnessed the murder.\nShe said her son Shivaprakash, 44, had been facing life threats from the associates of the MLA over a property dispute since February 2025. Shivaprakash had complained about the same to the police. He was allegedly murdered by a gang of eight persons who were instigated by the MLA representing K. R. Puram. Mr. Basavaraj has been listed as accused number five in the FIR.\nAccording to Ms. Vijayalakshmi, around 8.10 p.m. on Tuesday, Shivaprakash, his driver Imran Khan, and a friend, Lokesh, were engaged in a conversation on the road in front of their house at Bharathinagar. When she looked out from the balcony on the first floor, she saw a group of unidentified assailants attack Shivaprakash. When Imran Khan tried to rescue her son, he was also attacked with lethal weapons. She saw Lokesh filming the attack on his mobile phone. She screamed for help. Seeing people rushing to the spot, the assailants fled. By then, her son Shivaprakash was dead, Ms. Vijayalakshmi said in her complaint.\nShe said Shivaparakash had been engaged in the real estate business, as part of Extreme Point (Promoters and Developers) Pvt. Ltd., for the past year. She said her son had got a general power of attorney (GPA) for a plot of land at Kothanur in 2023. He had built a shed and arranged for two women to live there as security guards.\nIn February 2025, two men — Jagadish alias Jagga and Kiran — had trespassed into the plot of land. They threw out the two women living there. Later, Jagadish called Shivaparakash, threatening to “not let him be alive” if he did not transfer the GPA to his name, as it “was his area”, Ms. Vijayalakshmi claimed.\n“My son had been complaining that he faced threats to his life from Jagadish, Kiran, Anil, Vimal, and K.R. Puram MLA Byrathi Basavaraj. He had submitted several petitions in this regard to the police,” she stated in her complaint.\nShe suspects that her son was murdered by these four persons at the instigation of Mr. Basavaraj.\nReacting to the development, Mr.  Basavaraj denied any involvement in the case and questioned the police actions.\nSpeaking to the media at Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday, Mr. Basavaraj asked, “Did the police take any information from me before registering the FIR? I have absolutely no connection with the murder. Suddenly, the police have filed a case against me. Can anyone file a complaint and get an FIR registered without verification?”\nHe further alleged political motives behind the move. “This could be part of a political conspiracy. I will fight this legally. I had no information whatsoever about the deceased. The police registered a case without even recording my statement. There’s a clear conspiracy behind this,” he said. Mr. Basavaraj maintained that he would cooperate legally and fight the allegations in court."

    "content": "Story so far:Jammu Kashmir Chief MinisterOmar Abdullah defied his Lieutenant-Governor‘s (L-G) stance on ‘Martyrs’ Day’, on July 13, 2025, to pay tribute to the 22 civilians killed by Dogra rulers in 1931. Visuals shared by Mr. Omar Abdullah show him grappling with the authorities as he visited the Naqsbandh Sahib shrine at Khawaja Bazar to offerfatiha(prayer) at the martyrs’ graves. The L-G had barred the government and regional parties from paying tributes at the site.\n“The unelected government tried to block my way forcing me to walk from Nawhatta chowk. They blocked the gate to Naqsbandh Sahib shrine forcing me to scale a wall. They tried to physically grapple me but I was not going to be stopped today,” posted Mr. Abdullah. Highlighting the July 13 massacre asJ&K’s ‘Jallianwala Bagh’, Mr. Omar Abdullah said, “True heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims.”\nThis is the physical grappling I was subjected to but I am made of sterner stuff & was not to be stopped. I was doing nothing unlawful or illegal. In fact these \"protectors of the law\" need to explain under what law they were trying to stop us from offering Fatihapic.twitter.com/8Fj1BKNixQ\nWhile Mr. Abdullah was able to visit the shrine, no other leader was able to do so. NC leaders such as Showkat Mir, Imran Nabi Dar, Shafqat Watali, Nasir Aslam Wani and Tanvir Sadiq were eitherdetained or put under house arrest.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, J&K Apni Party (JKAP) president Altaf Bukhari and and J&K Peoples Conference (JKPC) president Sajad Lone, were also detained in their homes or offices.\nBJP has refused to mark the event as a ‘martyrdom’, maintaining that the slain civilians were ‘rioters’ and not national heroes.\nHere’s a look at why J&K observes this day and its changed nature since 2019\nIn 1931, Kashmir was in turmoil due to a series of incidents that had led torevolt by the Muslims citizensagainst the ruling Dogra administration.\nOn July 13, 1931, when trial started in Srinagar, a huge crowd had assembled outside the jail, raising slogans to seeking Qadeer’s freedom. As the protestors urged the judge to imprison them instead, police began to hit them with batons. In retaliation, the crowds pelted the Dogra police with stones and sticks. On the Governor’s orders, police opened fire at the protestors killing 17 Muslims on the spot, while five succumbed to injuries later. The slain civilians were buried in compound of Kanqah-i-Maula, three days later. The spot has since then been renamed as Mazar-i-Shuhada.\nThe incident gave impetus to calls for Jammu-Kashmir’s freedom from Maharaja Hari Singh’s rule. The Reading Room party, founded by Sheikh Abdullah, established the Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference with the sole aim to protect Muslim rights. His demands for self-rule of the Kashmiri people too gained traction and a Legislature was set up by the Maharaja in 1934.\nIn 1947, after Maharaja Hari Singh fled to Jammu after acceding Kashmir to India, Sheikh Abdullah was appointed as J&K’s first Prime Minister. He declared July 13 as ‘J&K Martyr’s day’ and has been observed by consequent governments. Pakistan also observes the same day to honour Kashmiri civilian martyrs. Qadeer is believed to be born in Swat, which falls currently in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\nThrough the years, Martyrs’ day has seen ‘house arrest’ of Opposition leaders whenever the State has been put under President’s rule. In 1986, then CM Farooq Abdullah threatened to launch a fresh struggle if the Governor’s rule was not ended by September 7 that year. While most other Opposition leaders like G. M. Shah, Ghulam Nabi Kochak, Moulvi Abbas Ansari, Abdul Gani Lone were placed under ‘house arrest’, Dr. Farooq Abdullah and his ally, Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq, were allowed to pay tributes to the martyrs.\nBJP has never officially recognised or observed ‘Martyr’s day’, maintaining, “People killed then are those who broke the law and the State forces did what was required under the law. We neither believe in martyr’s day, nor do we approve it”.\nOn September 13, 1989, Kashmiri Pandit leader andBJP member Tika Lal Taploowas slain by Kashmiri militants. BJP and Kashmiri Pandits across India began observing September 13 as ‘Martyr’s Day’, holding rallies andshraads (death anniversary) to honour Taploo. Through the years, BJP has used this event to voice the concerns of the Hindu minority in Kashmir and the targetted attacks on the community by militants.\nIn 2015, when BJP allied with J&K People’s Democratic Party to form a coalition government, the saffron party ‘boycotted’ the July 13 Martyrs’ Day event — a first for a ruling J&K party. “The 1931 martyrs have no relevance for our party. If Kashmir-based political parties do not attend the functions we hold in memory of our leaders like Syama Prasad Mookerjee, why should we attend their Martyrs’ Day,” said BJP’s Kashmir spokesperson Khalid Jehangir. Since then, it has continuously boycotted the event.\nBefore Article 370 was abrogated in August 2019, then Governor Satya Pal Malik skipped the official state event, along with his Chief Secretary and four non-local advisors. Post-abrogation, the L-G has delisted ‘Martrys’ day’ as an official holiday and scrapped the event observing it.\nAfter the election of the Union territory’s first CM, Mr. Omar Abdullah, the ruling National Conference and other J&K parties this year, sought permission for their delegations to be allowed to visit the graveyard and pay tributes. However, the J&K Police denied permission to all regional parties to hold any commemoration functions at the graveyard.\n“The District Administration Srinagar has denied permission to all applicants intending to proceed towards Khawaja Bazar, Nowhatta on 13th July 2025 (Sunday). The General Public is hereby advised to strictly comply with these instructions. Any violation of these orders shall invite strict legal action under relevant provisions of law,” warned the police.\nAs politicians were put under house arrest, Mr. Omar Abdullah posted, “Today the unelected nominees of New Delhi locked up the elected representatives of the people of J&K. All to stop people from visiting a historically important grave yard containing the graves of people who laid down their lives to give Kashmiris a voice & to empower them,” echoing hurt sentiments of Kashmiri Muslims."

Ravindar Rao thanked NABARD for implementing innovative programmes at the grassroots level.\nRegistrar of Cooperative Societies Surendra Mohan told the gathering that the Telangana government accords top priority to rural development and development of women and farmers. NABARD has stood with the State government in modernising, revitalising and expanding the cooperative landscape. A total of 289 PACS in Telangana have been strengthened through refinance and infrastructure development, including the world’s largest grain storage project in Gambhiraopet PACS.\nNAFSCOB Chairman K Ravinder and State Bank of Hyderabad, Hyderabad Circle, CGM Radhakrishnan spoke. A booklet on Unit Cost that works as a handbook for bankers to decide the credit for various agriculture and allied activities, a report on the Impact Evaluation Study on Farmer Producers Organisations and a booklet on a-IDEA of NAARM were released."

    "content": "In what comes as a relief from the logjam created by the implementation of the December 2024 Supreme Court order, which mandated an occupancy certificate (OC) for getting utility connections, concerned departments have now decided to propose to the Cabinet to bring in amendments to multiple laws of the State and notify rules to mandate OC for only buildings built on plots above 1200 sq. ft (30X40 ft) across the State.\nThis essentially means all buildings built on sites larger than 30X40 feet will have to take an OC, henceforth, which was not the case earlier in Bengaluru. Following the implementation of the Supreme Court, over 1 lakh applications seeking new power connections have been pending in the Bescom area alone, for want of an OC. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar and Energy Minister K.J. George had said that the State government would soon introduce amendments to resolve the impasse.\n“The problem was that, in none of our governing acts are there clear exemptions to any buildings from OC. However, in practice, since the utility service providers were also not insisting on it, our urban local bodies were not issuing OCs to all buildings, but insisted on it only for bigger buildings. Legally, it has been a grey area. It is impractical to insist on OCs in all buildings, so there needs to be amendments to our laws to clarify which buildings are exempted,” said a senior official.\nThe Urban Development Department (UDD) and Panchayat Raj Department met with other stakeholders on July 11, minutes of which are available withThe Hindu. In the meeting, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suggested that buildings built on plots up to 1200 sqft (ground + 2 floors or stilt +3 floors) can be exempted from obtaining OCs. The Panchayat Raj Department also concurred with the same exemption.\nNeither the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, nor the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964, has any provision for exemption for any buildings from availing an OC. The meeting has decided to propose amendments to these laws to bring this change.\nMeanwhile, Section 241(7) of the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act, 2024 says: “Government may notify the category of building which shall be exempted from obtaining occupancy certificate”. The meeting decided to notify of the exemption for buildings built on plots up to 1200 sq. ft. The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department will also adopt the same exemption in its Model Building Byelaws."

    "content": "As Karkidakam, the final and most spiritually significant month of the Malayalam calendar, begins on July 17, thousands of devotees across Kerala are preparing for the sacred Nalambala Darshan, a unique pilgrimage that takes them to four temples dedicated to Lord Rama and his brothers, all in a single day.\nTraditionally viewed as a month of misery, marked by rain, disease, and hardship, Karkidakam is also revered for its spiritual richness. Believers turn to the Ramayana for solace and strength, often reading the epic throughout the month. It is said that sage Valmiki completed the Ramayana during this time. In this context, the Nalambala Darshan becomes more than a ritual, it is a symbolic journey of inner renewal and devotion.\nThe pilgrimage of Nalambala Darshan is taken to the Sree Rama temple, Thriprayar; Bharatha temple, Koodalmanikyam; Lakshmana temple, Moozhikulam; and Sathrughna temple, Payammal. The temples have made elaborate arrangements to receive devotees for the pilgrimage.\nThe pilgrimage begins at the Sree Rama temple in Thriprayar. The temple opens as early as 3.30 a.m., with devotees advised to complete their darshan before the early morning pujas begin at 5 a.m. Long queues are expected, but elaborate arrangements, including rain shelters, CCTV surveillance, mobile counters for offerings, and ample parking, ensure a smooth experience. Offerings like ‘kathina vedi,’ ‘meenoottu’ (feeding fish), and ‘avil nivedyam’ are part of the traditional rituals.\nNext is the Koodalmanikyam temple in Irinjalakuda, dedicated to Bharata. Devotees enter through the eastern gate, offer prayers, and exit through the western side. The devotees also make a circumambulation of the temple tank, Kulipini Theertham. The temple sees heavy footfall on weekends and offers rituals such as ‘tamara mala’ (lotus garland), ‘neyvilakku,’ and ‘pushpanjali.’ Free ‘kanji’ is served daily in the ‘oottupura.’\nFrom there, pilgrims head to the Moozhikkulam Lakshmana Perumal temple in Ernakulam district. This rare temple, where Lakshmana is worshipped, opens at 4.30 a.m. Devotees follow a specific prayer sequence, offering items like ‘palpayasam,’ ‘unniyappam,’ and ‘elluthiri.’ A massive shelter accommodates over 5,000 devotees, and ‘annadanam’ (free meals) is arranged for around 3,000 daily.\nThe final stop is Payammal Shatrughna Temple, located near Irinjalakuda. The temple opens at 5.30 a.m. and remains accessible till 9.30 p.m. depending on crowd flow. Special rituals like ‘Sudarsana pushpanjali,’ ‘chandanam charthal,’ and ‘shankhabhishekam’ are performed for the removal of obstacles and blessings of prosperity.\nInterestingly, the pilgrimage both begins and ends at Thriprayar, a full circle of devotion. As devotees walk this spiritual path, they don’t just traverse geography, they traverse the legacy of righteousness, loyalty, and dharma that the sons of king Dasharatha represent.\nThe Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is conducting special services for the devotees for Nalambala Darshan."

Mr. Bharath asked them to focus on developing parks and complete the repair works by August end. “Steps should be taken to repair the potholes without any delay. By the end of December this year, 30,000 saplings should be planted and officials should ensure their protection. The Secretariats functioning from community halls should be shifted to alternate places,” he instructed.\nHe then asked the officials not to delay the road extension works and to pay compensation to those who lose their land due to the extension.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bharath urged the people of Kurnool city to use the Puramithra App to notify officials of their complaints related to civic issues. He wanted them to send photographs through the app so that the officials could respond. “Download the app brought by the Municipal Administration Department and upload the photos of any civic grievance on it. The officials will visit the place within 24 hours and will try to rectify the problem,” he said, and added that people need not visit government offices to get their problems resolved. Complaints related to bad roads, sanitation, water supply, street lights and others can be uploaded."

    "content": "The Karnataka government’s decision to cancel the acquisition of land in Devanahalli for an aerospace park has led to a tug of war between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka over the future of the project, with Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh inviting the aerospace industry to his State and Karnataka Industries Minister M.B. Patil stating that there was no need to relocate.\nBoth Ministers spoke toThe Hinduafter a sharp exchange of comments on the issue on social media platform X.\nSpeaking a day after his post on the subject went viral, Mr. Lokesh, Andhra Pradesh Minister for Human Resource Development, Information Technology, and Real Time Governance, said that his invitation to industries in the aerospace sector was meant seriously.\n“I believe in States being competitive, and the offer was made in that spirit. We are actively thinking of reaching out to the aerospace industry to set up shop in Andhra Pradesh, we have over 8,000 acres to spare, and Anantapur is a good spot. Apart from Kia (South Korean automobile multinational Kia Corporation), we are actively looking at the renewable energy and defence industries sectors for that area. We are totally prepared to scale up the infrastructure required,” he said.\nResponding to Mr. Lokesh’s offer, Karnataka Industries Minister M.B. Patil categorically stated that the cancellation of the land acquisition in Devanahalli, after protests by farmer groups, did not mean the end of the aerospace project.\n“Out of the 1,700 acres that were earmarked, there are some people, with around 700 acres, who voluntarily came forward for land acquisition. Also, this is not the last parcel of land available in Karnataka. For the aerospace industry to prosper, elements apart from land are also crucial, which are available in Karnataka, like an ecosystem for defence-related industries to flourish. Karnataka provides 65% of the aerospace base in the country and is the third largest globally. Not even one industry will move out of Karnataka for want of land. I want to convey to Nara Lokesh that our waters are calm,” Mr. Patil said. “This morning itself I had a meeting with officials from an aerospace company and things are still on,” he added.\nThe land acquisition in Devanahalli was halted after 1,198 days of protests, with direct intervention by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in favour of farmers who did not want to give up land for industry and wanted to continue with agriculture. The aerospace park project envisaged a large space for the development of the sector.\nWhile the war of words has been on, the involvement of senior Ministers has a history behind it. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had, in a previous tenure as Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, managed to entice the team setting up the Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad, despite feelers from other States, by being proactive about the ISB team’s concerns over land and other issues at the time."

The Supreme Court has made it clear that Election Commission cannot determine people's citizenship. Does the Election Commission, by carrying out such an exercise now, intend to say that the electoral roll of 2014, when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, was fake?\".\nHe added, \"The same electoral roll was fine till last year's Lok Sabha polls. We fail to see a problem in conducting the upcoming assembly polls on the basis of the same voters' list.\"\n\"Obviously, the BJP is jittery in Bihar realising that the people here now have a new alternative in Jan Suraaj Party. So they are trying to wrongfully delete the names of voters. I would ask all people who face such wrongful deletions to contact our party. We will extend all possible help\", said the former political strategist.\nMr. Kishor, whose nine-month-old party is aiming to make a big dent in the state's Muslim vote base, also trained his guns at the RJD, which has so far been the first party of choice for the minority community.\n\"The RJD has treated Muslims as nothing more than the kerosene that could serve to keep the lantern bright. But the community has now had enough,\" said the Jan Suraaj Party founder, in an obvious reference to the main opposition party's poll symbol.\nReplying to a query, he said he saw \"no role\" in Bihar for the AIMIM headed by Asaduddin Owaisi, which had won a few seats in the 2020 assembly polls and has expressed the desire to contest the upcoming elections as part of the INDIA bloc.\n\"Bihar does not need to import leaders from Hyderabad,\" asserted Mr. Kishor, whose own party has decided to go it alone in the polls.\nThe IPAC founder, who has in his previous avatar handled election campaigns of several political parties across the ideological divide, was also asked about the Hindi versus Marathi row that has erupted in Maharashtra.\nBlaming the controversy on \"Thackeray brothers\", son and nephew of late Bal Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray, respectively, Mr. Kishor said, \"these people are lumpen elements. But the Congress and the BJP too have their share of the blame as these national parties have no qualms in tying up with such divisive forces.\"\nHe also alleged that Bihar BJP president Dilip Jaiswal has indulged in corruption and favouritism in his capacity as one of the trustees of Kishanganj-based MGM Medical College and challenged the latter, a sitting MLC and former State Minister, to initiate legal action \"if what I am saying is wrong\"."

    "content": "A Climate-Resilient and Energy-Efficient Agriculture (CREEA) report, a State‑wide roadmap shaped by 14 district workshops and consultations with experts from 16 departments (ranging from Agriculture to Power and Disaster Management), was released here on Wednesday.\nThe exercise, steered jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Energy Management Centre (EMC) under the Power department, and climate-policy organisations Asar Social Impact Advisors and Equinoct, charts how Kerala can protect crops, livelihood, and food security as extreme weather tightens its grip on the ₹56,000‑crore farm economy of the State.\nThe CREEA framework has been prepared against the backdrop of the climate crisis and its impact on the food system in Kerala. Around 94% of Kerala’s cropped area has already been categorised as climate-vulnerable, with loss in paddy and banana cultivation rising by 28% since the 2018 floods, according to the State Agriculture Directorate data.\n“Further, farm power use has doubled in a decade alone. The report outlines pathways to cut on-farm energy demand by up to 40% through solar pumps, biogas, and precision irrigation. By reducing production cost, improving soil health, and promoting biodiversity, CREEA will fortify rural livelihood against price and climate shocks,” says agricultural scientist S. Usha, the lead author of the report.\nAgriculture Minister P. Prasad unveiled the report at a farmer-scientist consultation, while Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty opened a technical dialogue on its recommendations. “CREEA is more than a study; it is a blueprint for an inclusive, low-carbon farm economy that keeps smallholders at the centre of climate action,” Mr. Prasad said.\nThe ideas highlighted in the report include forming K-CRAIL (Kerala Climate‑Resilient Agriculture Innovation Labs) at 941 panchayats in phases. The farmer-led “living labs” at panchayat, block, and district levels will trial bio-inputs, micro-irrigation, and resilient cropping systems.\nThe report also suggested forming farmer seed and bio-resource networks, AI-powered risk-mapping platform, low-carbon mechanisation drive, and supporting small and marginal farmers through targeted subsidies.\nAn inter‑departmental CREEA steering task force will be notified this quarter to finalise a three‑year implementation plan. Pilot K-CRAIL labs are slated for launch in Alappuzha, Palakkad, and Wayanad by early 2026.  The EMC will draft an investment prospectus to channel public-private finance into low-carbon mechanisation and AI-enabled advisory services."

The ratio of school dropouts has increased. Maternal and infant mortality are being reported frequently. Migration of rural people to big cities for livelihood and child marriage have become unsolved issues. The officers of the departments concerned should extend coordination to each other in solving the problems with immediate and effective steps,” Mr. Naik said.\nMr. Naik, who is the chairman of the DISHA committee under which three Assembly constituencies, Yadgir, Shahapur and Shorapur, fall, said that Agriculture Department officers should hold programmes for farmers to make them aware of using nano fertiliser which is being treated as an alternative to urea and DAP.\nHe specifically advised the officers to create necessary awareness among farmers about sprinklers, soil tests and also, having their cards.\nThe MP suggested finding solutions for problems that arise in implementing bypass roads for Yadgir and Shahapur cities and the Hyderabad road from Ramsamudra village via Gurmitkal and the Surat-Chennai Express Highway, as farmers have raised entry and exit issues through it to their farmland.\nHe added that the officers of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Karnataka Industries Area Development Board (KIADB) jointly solve the issue involved in laying pipelines to supply water from the Krishna river to the Railway Coach Factory at the Kadechur-Badiyal Industrial Area under the National Highway that passes near the area.\nMLAs Sharanagouda Kandkur and Raja Venugopal Naik raised some issues in implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission, Jaladhare, identifying a place for Akka Cafe and Indira Canteen and schemes sponsored by the Union government.\nDeputy Commissioner Harshal Boyar, Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat Lavish Ordia, Superintendent of Police Pruthvik Shankar and officers were present."

Narasimha, instead, issued notice to the State and the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations on a petition challenging the High Court decision.\nThe High Court had directed Kerala to revert to the standardisation formula followed in the original prospectus of KEAM 2025.\nThe apex court listed the next hearing after four weeks. The court did not budge even though petitioners requested an earlier date of hearing for the reason that admission procedures would be over by August 14 as per the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) deadline.\nMeanwhile, the State of Kerala informed it was not filing an appeal against the High Court order. The top court had, on July 15, asked Kerala to revert on whether it planned to file an appeal.\nAppearing for Kerala, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta said the State proposed to implement the necessary reforms in KEAM’s standardisation formula the next year in order to level any bumps in the playing field between CBSE and State syllabus candidates.\n“We propose to make the change next year,” Mr. Gupta said.\nAppearing for a group of CBSE students who had filed a caveat in the case, senior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph said the State must also reflect on why State syllabus students were lagging behind their CBSE counterparts year after year.\n“Perhaps they need to have a relook of the curriculum. There has to be an introspection by Kerala and other States,” Mr. Ramachandran said.\nAdvocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., representing the State syllabus students who appealed against the High Court order, countered that the State’s decision to amend the standardisation formula was a result of such an “introspection”. The amended formula had been devised to end the disparity between CBSE and State syllabus candidates for KEAM.\nThe State had constituted the Standardisation Review Committee in April after exam authorities had flagged that the 1:1:1 ratio for marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry gave CBSE students an unfair advantage over the State Board students.\n“This had meant the State students would see their marks drop while the CBSE students would have their marks soar,” Mr. Bhushan said.\nOn July 1, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, had decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025 to 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. It had gone on to publish the KEAM rank list the very same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court had directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus.\n“The State government was entirely within its right to make the amendment. It was done on the basis of a report by an expert committee. The High Court had intervened despite a consistent stand by this court to not intervene in policy matters unless they were found to be arbitrary or discriminatory to students,” Mr. Bhushan argued.\nMr. Gupta said the State was entirely with Mr. Bhushan on merits, and assured reforms for next academic year."

The selected students, mostly from Arab countries, Africa and Sri Lanka, will be admitted to undergraduate and postgraduate programmes including BA, BCom and MA.

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh IT Minister Nara Lokesh has drawn flak from farmers’ organisations in his State forextending an open invitation to the aerospace industry to Andhra Pradeshwith an offer of 8,000 acres of ready-to-use land.\nMr. Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, had put out an open invitation to the aerospace industry on social media on Tuesday in a bid to take advantage of theKarnataka government shelving the process of acquisition of 1,777 acres of farmland in Devanahalli taluk,near Bengaluru international airport, for the proposed defence and aerospace park, following stiff resistance from farmers.\nFarmers’ organisations in Andhra Pradesh termed his promise of providing 8,000 acres of land just outside Bengaluru as “inappropriate” and the struggle by Karnataka’s Devanahalli farmers demanding shelving of land acquisition as “historical”.\nIn a statement, Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao, convener of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers’ Associations’ Coordination Committee and Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s Andhra Pradesh unit, said, “Farmer organisations of Andhra Pradesh strongly object to this highly inappropriate statement. Without the consent of the farmers in the Lepakshi Knowledge Park area and without paying the legally mandated compensation under the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, the government has no authority to give away farmers’ land.”\nMr. Rao, who had earlier served as Agriculture Minister in the Chandrababu government, defended the demand by Devanahalli farmers to shelve the land acquisition. “The proposed land acquisition has been strongly opposed by local farmers in a historic struggle. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, respecting the farmers’ demands, announced the withdrawal of the proposal.”\nMeanwhile, Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya has drawn the ire of farmers’ leaders from Karnataka for endorsing Mr. Lokesh’s statement by posting on social media that “this is how business is attracted, industry is welcomed and jobs are created. Hope Karnataka Government learns from Nara Lokesh Garu and correct its course.” Mr. Surya deleted his post later.\nObjecting to this, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Badagalapura Nagendra made it clear that farmers were not opposed to industrialisation, but were against acquisition of fertile farmland for industrial projects.\nQuestioning the logic of Mr. Surya, he said: “The farm sector continues to be the biggest employment generator in the country as it engages nearly 60% of the country’s population. There is a dire need to protect the farm sector too.”\nMr. Nagendra referred to the impact of losing green spaces around Bengaluru and said that there is increasingly not even adequate water to take care of the city’s growing needs.\nKRRS (Collective leadership) president Chukki Nanjundaswamy too took exception to Mr. Surya’s statement and maintained that agriculture and development are not contradictory. “Development does not mean only industrial development. Development of the farming sector is also development,” she said, opposing the view that heeding the demand of farmers to drop acquisition of their fertile and productive farmland for an industrial project, would not make a business sense."

    "content": "Snakelets of Spectacled Cobras are keeping the volunteers of Friends of Snakes Society (FoSS) in Telangana busy this monsoon.\nThe eggs of this snake species hatch from June through September. Over2,970 out of the 5,954 snakes rescued by the Society,from January to June,were Spectacled Cobras. And 1,134 more were rescued from June to July 16.\nAround a week ago, a volunteer with the Society, Aditya Srinath, spent over 12 hours to rescue 23 snakelets and an adult Spectacled Cobra in Jagadgirigutta. These reptiles were found slithering in and out of a small crevice in the concrete floor between the house and a compound wall.\nMr. Srinath said that the floor was hollow and that provided an ideal space to lay eggs. “I reached there at around 7 p.m. and rescued 19 snakelets till 3 a.m. I returned the next day and rescued the remaining five,” he said.\nThe mating season of Spectacled Cobras is from January to April and they lay eggs from March to July, said Chelmela Srinivasulu, professor at Department of Zoology, Osmania University and Director, Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies. The incubation period is 45 to 70 days. “August is the peak hatching period,” he said.\nThough the monsoon has set in, rains have not been intense. Avinash Visvanatham, general secretary of the Society said that when human movement is not restricted due to less rains, people increasingly spot snakes.\nP. Gowri Shankar, founder trustee ofKalinga Foundation,a non-profit research organisation, said that monsoon offers multiple ways of survival such as abundant frogs, toads, rodents, and insects, ensuring food availability for the young.\n“Dense monsoon vegetation offers them shelter and concealment from predators and reduces exposure. The high-humidity monsoon environment prevents hatchling desiccation, vital during their early vulnerable phase. When many hatch at once, predator risk is distributed, reducing per-individual threat,” said Dr. Gowri Shankar, a wildlife biologist who has been studying King Cobras and other snakes for close to two decades."

    "content": "Opposing the State government’s proposed plan to acquire agricultural lands at Karedu village of Ulavapadu mandal in Prakasam district for the Indosol Solar Private Limited’s solar module manufacturing plant, the members of Human Rights Forum (HRF) and Rashtra Cheneta Jana Samakhya (RCJS) demanded to immediately call off the project.\nThe State government has already released multiple notifications to acquire the farm lands at Karedu and other villages. On Wednesday, they campaigned along with the villagers against the land acquisition of more than 8,500 acres in various villages for the proposed project. They addressed street meetings and distributed pamphlets to the local people.\nAddressing the public, HRF Sate general secretary Y. Rajesh and secretary G. Rohith said that the State government is unnecessarily acquiring such a large extent of land when a fraction of it is enough for the project. They also pointed out that the government is facilitating a company that has no track record in taking up such a big project.\nDuring the campaign, RCJS president M. Mohan Rao alleged that the government had taken an undemocratic decision to waive off the consent and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) requirements of the project. “The legal standing of this waiver is on shaky grounds, given that such waiver can only be done in the public interest. Except providing gains to a private company, one is hard pressed to find any public interest in this project. This proposed project involves silica processing, which has been established as highly toxic and polluting,” he said.\nThe HRF and RCJS members questioned the government‘s largesse to Indosol Solar Limited to the tune of around ₹45,000 crore, which is a staggering 60 per cent of the total proposed investment. The alleged it as socialising costs and privatising profits to a private company.\nEarlier, farmers from Karedu met former Chief Minister and YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at the party’s central office in Tadepalli on Tuesday. They had submitted a request letter seeking his support in protecting their agricultural lands at Karedu from industrial use.\nThe farmers expressed strong opposition to the government’s decision to allocate these lands for the project and explained that the area supports two crops a year and sustains thousands of farming and fishing families. They are afraid that the industrial takeover would threaten their livelihood and disrupt the local environment."

Despite being a major one, the K.R. Hospital lacked an RO plant and water was being supplied in cans, the quality of which cannot be assured.\nMr. Krishna said that a notice was served against the contractor of one of the hospital kitchens he visited, where the food provided to patients was not in accordance with the fixed menu. “If the contractor fails to comply with the norm and quality of the food, the contract will be cancelled and a fresh one will be provided,” he warned."

(SHCIL) on the e-stamping transactions that added substantial cost to the process. The SHCIL had been appointed as an intermediary in 2008 for vending e-stamps.\nThe draft of Karnataka Stamps (Digital e-stamp) Rules, 2025, was notified on July 14. Once implemented, it will not only replace traditional stamp papers with entirely digital stamping but also align with sustainability goals, making the process paperless. “The new module is expected to be implemented before the month-end,” Revenue Department sources said.\nThe new module will replace the e-stamping system, which was launched in 2008 to prevent fraudulent practices in stamp paper-based registrations and transactions. Incidentally, the e-stamp was introduced as a fallout of the fake stamp paper racket run by counterfeiter Abdul Karim Telgi, whose alleged multi-thousand-crore worth fraud also shook Karnataka politics in the early 2000s. The department had also started work on e-stamping in 2006.\nThe new module will also encourage registration of approximately three crore optionally registrable documents that are processed annually. These documents are not in an audit trail, creating significant gaps in accountability and revenue tracking, according to a department note.\nAmong other perceived benefits, which will be introduced in phases, are the template-based deed writing that enables users to draft deeds directly on the portal using customisable templates, ensuring standardisation and accuracy. This will also secure Aadhaar-based e-signatures of all the parties involved, ensuring authenticity and validity. While it allows direct payment integration with the treasury, the new system also secures digital storage of stamped documents, eliminating the need for physical storage."

    "content": "Auto aggregator platform Namma Yatri has come under criticism from commuters after it began charging the newly revised autorickshaw fares a fortnight ahead of the official implementation date announced by the government.\nThe fare hike, announced by the Bengaluru Urban Regional Transport Authority (RTA) on July 14, is scheduled to come into effect from August 1. The revised structure raises the base fare for the first 2 km from ₹30 to ₹36, and the per-km rate beyond that from ₹15 to ₹18.\nHowever, several commuters noticed that Namma Yatri, which claims to be a driver-first platform supported by autorickshaw unions, had already begun implementing the new rates from July 15 itself, a day after the official announcement.\nSiddharth Kumar, a resident of Arekere on Bannerghatta Road, was surprised to see the revised fare while booking a ride on the night of July 15 from M.G. Road. “The fare breakup in the app showed ₹36 for the first 2 km and ₹18 per km after that, even though the new fares are supposed to be implemented from August 1. This is unethical and amounts to misusing the fare hike to overcharge customers. Namma Yatri started as an honest initiative by drivers, is now behaving like any other aggregator,” he said.\nAnother commuter, Priya R., who frequently uses autos for her daily office commute in Indiranagar, shared a similar experience. It’s disappointing that a platform built by drivers for the people would jump the gun and disregard official timelines. It raises questions about accountability,” she said.\nAdding to the confusion, the app also showed a waiting time charge of ₹1.50 per minute after 3 minutes, while the RTA’s official notification allows a free waiting time of 5 minutes, followed by a charge of ₹10 for every 15 minutes.\nWhen contacted, Shan M.S., co-founder of Namma Yatri, clarified that the revised fare display was not a full rollout but part of a limited pilot. In an email response toThe Hindu, he said, “We would like to clarify that the new fare policy displayed on the app from July 15 was part of a limited pilot to test system readiness and gather driver-citizen feedback ahead of the official implementation.”\n“However, Namma Yatri will adopt the revised fare structure strictly as per government directions (starting August 1). Until then, we continue to follow the prevailing auto fare structure notified by the Government of Karnataka,” he said.\nThe early rollout, even if termed a pilot, has raised concerns about transparency and consistency in fare implementation.The Hinducontacted Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha regarding this issue; however, he did not respond."

    "content": "Employees of all four State Road Transport Corporations (RTCs) in Karnataka have announced that they will go on an indefinite strike from August 5, halting bus services across the State. The Joint Action Committee of Workers’ Unions made the announcement, citing the government’s continued neglect of their long-pending demands.\nIn a letter to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the unions criticised the government for ignoring transport workers’ grievances, including the release of pending arrears, pay revision, and timely promotions. “Despite repeated calls for strikes, the government only holds meetings and promises resolutions in a few days or months, but nothing changes,” said H. V. Ananth Subbarao, president of the KSRTC Staff and Workers’ Federation.\nAmong their key demands, the unions have sought an increase in various staff allowances, improved medical facilities, and regularisation of drivers and technical staff currently hired on a contract basis. They have also urged that only permanent corporation drivers be deployed to operate electric buses, not contract staff.\nThe union leaders argued that transport workers had played a vital role in implementing welfare schemes like the ‘Shakti Scheme’, which has generated goodwill and revenue for the government. “Despite our contribution, the government has completely ignored us,” Mr. Subbarao said."

    "content": "The golden visa schemes that are being introduced by several countries including the United Arab Emirates is a response to the  currently prevailing sense of global uncertainties, said a leading immigration specialist. Speaking toThe Hinduin New Delhi on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Andri Boiko, Dubai-based immigration specialist and entrepreneur said pandemic, conflicts in West Asia and Ukraine, U.S. President Trump’s orders on U.S. citizenship rules and attraction of tax relief among high net worth individuals in the Global South are reshaping the immigration landscape of the world.\n“United Arab Emirates has started the golden visa scheme that will give ten year visa for high net worth individuals and for individuals with extraordinary skills from India and other countries. Argentina is also expected to start the golden visa scheme later this year,” said Mr. Boiko, explaining that the way global immigration rules are being redefined against the background of the tough changes that are being introduced by the U.S. administration.\nPresident Trump on January 20 issued Executive Order 14160“denying citizenship to persons born from a mother who was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) at the time of said person’s birth”. The order has been at the centre of a fierce debate and has been challenged in the court putting a question mark on the citizenship status of many U.S. citizens.\nMr. Boiko, who started ‘Garant In’ in 2009 as a citizenship and residency advisory service in Dubai, said changing rules and taxation are pushing more and more high achievers to find safe locations where they can ensure safety of their finances and conduct business without hindrance.\n“The UAE’s golden visa will give high net worth investors and high achievers from India and other countries the edge of Dubai while they will continue to be based in India,” said Mr. Boiko, adding, “You can get the golden visa without surrendering Indian passport and this will increasingly become a trend worldwide”.\nMr. Boiko pointed out that while some countries in the West are cracking down on illegal immigration from the Global South, there also some western countries especially Portugal, Italy, France in Europe who want to welcome high net worth individuals from major countries in the Global South. “Taxation, future security of finances and investment into the next generation, status symbol, are also among the reasons that are prompting high net worth people from the Global South to explore possibility of becoming a long term resident of a country like Italy and France,” said Mr. Boiko."

A single-room construction, used as Thottapura (explosives store) by the erstwhile Travancore kingdom, is the latest Raj-era buildings to fall into disrepair in the district.\nThe building is believed to have been constructed during the period of Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, who ruled Travancore as regent. The primary purpose of the construction was to store the explosives required for the construction of temples and the Kottayam-Kumily (KK) Road. The building is believed to have been constructed around 100 years ago using stone and ‘surkhi.’ A magnet was fixed on the building’s roof to protect it from lightning.\nThe building, covered by the roots of a banyan tree, has been in a dilapidated condition over the years. Recently, the roots started to wither, resulting in sudden damage to the building. On Tuesday, it collapsed. Residents have demanded measures to safeguard the historical structure.\nThe Thottapura, covered by roots of a banyan tree, a year ago. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\nA few Raj-era buildings still remain in the Peerumade hills. The 130-year-old Kuttikkanam Palace, also known as Ammachi Kottaram, is one such.\nAccording to Tourism department sources, if the ownership of such historical buildings is given to the department, it can include the sites in heritage tourism projects and ensure the protection and historical worth of such buildings. Buildings such as the Thottappura would help educate the younger generation about our past, said a Toursim department official."

It is likely to submit a detailed report addressing all pending issues, including projects under construction, newly proposed projects, and the management of existing ones on both the Godavari and Krishna rivers and their tributaries, informed Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy in New Delhi on Wednesday.\nDuring a press briefing after a meeting with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on water issues in New Delhi, Mr. Reddy termed the decision to constitute a committee as the first step in their efforts to resolve all water disputes between the two States.\n“We will take a final call on any issue only after the committee submits its report,” he said, stressing the need to honour the report.\nReiterating his government’s commitment to resolving all issues related to water sharing with Andhra Pradesh, the Chief Minister said that they were trying to find permanent solutions to all the disputes. He, however, clarified that the issue of the controversial Godavari-Banakacherla project proposed by Andhra Pradesh had not come up at the meeting, as it was not on the agenda.\nIn response to a query about the legal binding nature of the decisions taken at the meeting, Mr. Reddy said that the Jal Shakti Minister C.R. Patil had facilitated the meeting on behalf of the Union government, but it does not have any legal binding on either State. “However, the decisions taken at the meeting must be honoured,” he added.\nAccusing the previous governments in both States of failing to resolve these issues, he alleged that Opposition parties had wished for the failure of the meeting for political gain. “But we have successfully arrived at four key resolutions — constitution of a committee, installation of telemetry equipment at all drawing points under the Krishna River, location of offices for both the Godavari River Management and Krishna River Management Boards, and repairs and rehabilitation of the Srisailam Dam, which is showing signs of damage,” he added. Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy also addressed the media."

During the meeting, Mr. Satyanarayana lauded their role in villages, claiming that they save people’s money by providing basic treatment and even minor surgical intervention. He said, “In earlier days, people without medical qualifications have done a lot of service to people.”\nTo these remarks, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Telangana Junior Doctors’ Network issued a response, stating, “Such statements are not only misleading and medically unethical but also pose a direct threat to public health, especially in rural and underserved regions. At a time when the medical fraternity is working to improve healthcare delivery and public trust, these remarks undermine both the law and the efforts of qualified professionals.”\nEchoing similar sentiments, the Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA) called the remarks shocking and highly irresponsible, especially coming from someone who belongs to the medical fraternity.\nThe Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA) also condemned the MLA’s comments, saying, “The blatant endorsement of quackery by an elected public representative poses a grave threat to public health and constitutes a serious breach of medical ethics by undermining the credibility and safety of the healthcare system.”\nAll the associations have demanded a public apology from the MLA and called on the Telangana government to issue a clarification reaffirming its commitment to curbing quackery in line with National Medical Commission (NMC) guidelines."

    "content": "The Thiruvananthapuram international airport has commissioned its open access fuel farm and aircraft refuelling Facility, a move poised to redefine operational efficiency and sustainability standards in the aviation sector of the country. An open access fuel farm is a common fuel storage and supply system that allows multiple oil marketing companies to provide aviation fuel through a shared infrastructure.\nAirlines benefit from greater choice and competitive pricing, while the system eliminates infrastructure redundancy, enhances safety, and supports sustainability goals by reducing emissions from fuel transportation and handling. The newly commissioned facility has been developed through the strategic acquisition of existing assets from multiple oil marketing companies (OMCs) operating at the Thiruvananthapuram airport.\nIn the next 24 months, under the open access, the airport will also unveil a state-of-the-art large jet fuel storage facility featuring a unique hydrant refuelling system, which will enable faster, safer, and more streamlined aircraft refuelling, said a statement from the airport here on Wednesday.\nThe model will enhance the competition as the new entrants among fuel marketers can now access the airport without infrastructure investment barriers. A shared infrastructure system eliminates duplication and ensures lower cost of operations for all stakeholders. The hydrant system also reduces turnaround time, enhancing overall airport throughput, reducing the refuelling time drastically.\n“The launch of the open access fuel farm is a cornerstone in our vision to transform the Thiruvananthapuram airport into a future-ready aviation hub. This facility exemplifies innovation, operational excellence, and our commitment to supporting a greener and more efficient aviation ecosystem,” said the statement.\nThe open access fuel farm positions the Thiruvananthapuram airport among the few airports in India adopting progressive fuel infrastructure models, paving the way for increased airline choice, market competitiveness, and improved environmental performance."

    "content": "Researchers at Kerala University have unearthed vital historical data that sheds new light on the 1859 Carrington Event, one of most intense geomagnetic storms.\nDrawing from long-overlooked magnetic logs preserved at the historic Thiruvananthapuram Astronomical Observatory, the team has decoded hidden clues that could reshape the understanding of solar mega-storms and their future threat to modern civilisation.\nThe Carrington Event, triggered by a colossal solar flare, slammed Earth’s magnetosphere on September 2, 1859, unleashing global auroras and sparking unexplained surges in telegraph systems. While 19th-century technology endured the chaos, the scientists warn that a similar event today could cripple navigation systems, disrupt power grids, paralyse broadband networks and cellular communications, and trigger economic losses exceeding $1 trillion.\nLed by R. Jayakrishnan, the Observatory’s Director, the university’s research team analysed magnetic records made in the days before and after the 1859 solar outburst. Their findings, now published in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) publication,Advances in Space Research, reveal that Thiruvananthapuram’s logs, neglected for over a century, captured not only the main storm but also a precursor solar flare on August 28, 1859.\n“Although documented historically, it (the earlier flare) was long overlooked due to its modest appearance. The new analysis reveals that the incident likely destabilised Earth’s magnetic environment, effectively heightening the damage inflicted by the subsequent flare just days later,” Prof. Jayakrishnan explains.\nWhat distinguishes Thiruvananthapuram’s records is the precision of its measurements. Magnetic data had been captured at intervals of 2, 3, and 5 minutes, contrasting Mumbai’s Colaba Observatory which recorded data at 5-minute intervals only. These fine-grained analog observations are being digitised as part of an archival initiative supported by the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi.\nProf. Jayakrishnan adds that the study reaffirms Kerala’s historical role in advancing solar storm research. By applying modern modelling tools to legacy datasets, the researchers reconstructed how solar energy shaped Earth’s magnetic fields over a century and a half ago.\n“We are not just studying the past, but also preparing for tomorrow,” the principal investigator said. “Mega-storms may be rare, but when they hit, they can upend modern life. Insights from Thiruvananthapuram are helping us anticipate such threats.”"

He boasted about tabling the Kantharaj commission report in the State Cabinet. But after a phone call from Delhi and Rahul Gandhi’s directions, the report, which cost ₹165 crore to prepare, was thrown into the dustbin.”\nPointing out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi too hailed from a backward community, he said, “Unlike Mr. Siddaramaiah, who keeps claiming to be a backward class leader, Mr. Modi never played identity politics but instead promoted the ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas’ motto”.\nHe alleged that the OBC outreach and emotional appeals by Mr. Siddaramaiah and the AICC were merely due to the approaching Bihar Assembly elections."

Patil in New Delhi on Wednesday.\nDuring a media briefing after the meeting in the presence of Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Irrigation Minister N.

This will bring transparency and accountability in measuring water usage at each off-take point. We have decided to complete the work on a war-footing basis,” Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said, adding that Krishna River usage had long been a bone of contention between the two States.\nOn the issue of the Srisailam Dam’s structural integrity, the Andhra Pradesh government agreed to take up urgent repairs and rehabilitation work. “The dam, which has shown signs of wear — particularly in the plunge pool area — will now be restored under the supervision of the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA). The Union government has directed Andhra Pradesh to undertake the work on priority since the Srisailam Dam falls within their jurisdiction. Whatever needs to be done, whether in the plunge pool or other parts of the dam requiring urgent attention, will be taken up immediately,” he said.\nRegarding the location of the river management board offices, it was decided that the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) will be headquartered in Hyderabad, while the KRMB will function from Andhra Pradesh. “This decision is in line with the earlier understanding reached at the Apex Council meeting in 2020, and the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act were ratified at the meeting,” the Minister said.\nThe meeting was attended by senior officials from both States, Congress MPs, including Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mallu Ravi, and representatives of the Union Jal Shakti Ministry."

    "content": "The case pertaining to the alleged murder of a minor girl at the Gandikota tourist spot of Jammalamadugu constituency in Kadapa district, took an unexpected turn, with the investigation officials ruling out the sexual assault angle, as it had been projected earlier.\nIt may be recalled that the body of the 17-year-old girl, a second-year Intermediate student at a private college in Proddatur town, was found in the bushes behind a temple on Tuesday with her upper cloth removed, suggesting  occurence of sexual attack.\nHowever, the CCTV footage revealed that her lover Lokesh had left the spot upon getting a phone call from his relatives, evidently alerting him of a possible attack by the girl’s enraged family members. The boy was seen leaving Gandikota alone, leaving the girl behind.\nThe post-mortem reportedly revealed no traces of sexual assault on the girl, nor any attempt indicative of rape. However, the body had bite marks. Meanwhile, Lokesh also reportedly confessed to have merely spent an hour at the spot with the girl.\nThe girl’s cousin brother, who was one of the suspects in the case, reached the spot on a two-wheeler long after the boyfriend left, but he too had left the spot in 20 minutes after moving loitering around. This ‘short duration visit’ has apparently left the police department in a quandary over the possibility of him executing the attack.\nThough there are no external injuries, the medical team that performed the autopsy reportedly found internal bruises to the liver and intestine, indicative of an attack with a blunt weapon or a heavy kick to the stomach. The initial talk of gangrape, as well as the death due to strangulation, head injury, smothering have been ruled out.\nKurnool Range Deputy Inspector General of Police Koya Praveen who visited the spot, along with the Kadapa Superintendent of Police E.G. Ashok Kumar on Wednesday, ruled out Lokesh’s involvement in the girl’s death.\nMr. Ashok Kumar announced that they received fresh leads in the case, however, did not divulge any details. He also hinted at the likely involvement of a miscreant who might have seen the girl in a lonely and helpless condition. “We are inching towards the culprit, but cannot divulge anything more than this as of now,” he toldThe Hindu."

Of this, ₹26,000 crore had been mobilised so far.\nMr. Naidu urged the Centre to release the next tranche of funds as a grant rather than a loan. He also expressed gratitude to the Union Government for its continued support to major infrastructure projects such as Amaravati and Polavaram irrigation project."

    "content": "With the Bhoothathankettu small hydro project plagued by inordinate delays, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) now plans to send a technical team to China to inspect a delayed batch of equipment meant for the 24 megawatt (MW) initiative.\nWhether or not to reconsider a decision taken earlier this year to terminate a contract signed with a consortium of firms from Tamil Nadu and China for the electromechanical works of the small hydro project will depend on the team’s report, according to the KSEB.\nAccording to a July 14 order, the team will consist of the Director-in-charge (Generation and Civil), Executive Engineers handling the Projects Electrical Designs (PED) wing and the Generation Division at Edamalayar, and an independent expert. They will inspect the equipment and witness tests so that a report can be placed before the KSEB director board.\nKSEB chairman and managing director Mir Mohammed Ali toldThe Hinduthat while a decision has been taken to send the team to China, the date for its departure has not yet been finalised.\nThe drawn-out dispute pertains to the delayed despatch of the third and final consignment of electromechanical equipment from China. While the KSEB has received the first two consignments, the third was delayed over disputes related to the conditions of the contract.\nThe delayed consignment consists of key components of the generators, including rotor and stator.\nThe KSEB had executed the ₹81.80-crore contract for the electromechanical works with the consortium of Sree Saravana Engineering Bhavani Ltd. (SSEB), Tamil Nadu, and Hunan Zhaoyang Generation Equipment Company Ltd., China, on March 18, 2015. Under the original agreement, the work should have been completed in August 2016. Following delays, the final extension of time was given till March 31, 2023.\nIn April this year, the KSEB issued a termination notice to the consortium. On the basis of advice from the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC), the KSEB had also decided to invite new bids for the supply of the remaining equipment from China or from other sources.\nIn May, the Tamil Nadu firm approached the Kerala High Court against the decision to scrap the contract. The KSEB also decided to hold a “final meeting” with the consortium as it had already invested ₹169 crore in the civil and electromechanical works of this project.\nAccording to the KSEB, 86.61% of the electromechanical works and 98.4% of the civil construction works on the small hydro project are over."

    "content": "The High Court of Karnataka has expressed shock over the action of the Forest Department in registering a criminal case against an Assistant Commissioner (AC) of the Revenue Department for passing a quasi-judicial order describing certain land as ‘Government Gomal’ against the claim made by the Forest Department that it was ‘forestland’.\n“What shocks the conscience of the court is the Forest Department registering a crime for the performance of the AC’s quasi-judicial functions. As an Assistant Commissioner, looking into the records, he has passed an order, not bartering away the forestland to private entity, but observing it as a ‘Sarkari Gomala’ under the Revenue Department,” the court observed.\nJustice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing a petition filed by B.A. Jagadeesh, the then AC of Hassan sub-division, who is now working as Project Director, Hassan District Urban Development Cell.\nThe complaint before the Hassan judicial magistrate was lodged by IFoS officer Saurabh Kumar, the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, Hassan territorial division, in 2024.\nThe AC passed the order on January 5, 2022, declaring certain land, situated in Tyavalli village, Shanthigrama hobli, Hassan taluk, as ‘Sarkari (government) gomal’ land and was being used by many persons to access their private land. Stating that the land was ‘government gomal’ in the Records of Tenancy and Rights (RTC) for many years, but was classified as ‘forest’ in the recent RTCs, but the Forest Department had not produced documents based on which the RTC entries were changed.\nHowever, the Hassan Deputy Commissioner, on an appeal filed by the Forest Department, passed a quasi-judicial order asking the AC to consider the issue afresh giving sufficient opportunity of hearing to the Forest Department.\nInterestingly, the Forest Department, soon after the Deputy Commissioner remanded the issue back to the AC, registered the criminal complaint on January 27, 2024, against the petitioner, who was by then not holding the post of AC, Hassan sub-division.\n“After having filed an appeal and securing an order of remand to consider the issue afresh, it did not lie with the Forest Department to register a crime against the petitioner for having performed his quasi-judicial functions, unless it is found the exercise of such function is laced with criminality and foundationed onmens rea,” the court observed while noticing that the petitioner had not given the land to any private persons but had termed as land belonging to the Revenue Department on noticing that they were used for cattle grazing for ages.\nAllowing continuation of criminal proceedings against the petitioner in such circumstances would result in the miscarriage of justice and become an abuse of the process of the law, the court said while quashing the complaint. The criminal case against the petitioner was registered for alleged violation of the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980."

My concern is that if they go to Russia now, it will get tougher to keep in touch with them. So, I wish they could stay in India,\" said Mr. Goldstein toPTIVideos on Wednesday (July 16, 2025).\nDror Goldstein (38), who said he lives for nearly six months a year in Goa, said he had been living separately from Kutina (40) for the last couple of years and that he \"lost touch\" with them when she took the daughters and left Goa a few months ago.\n\"I managed to find them on a beach in Gokarna, but Kutina refused to let me be with my children as I don’t live with them anymore,\" added Mr. Goldstein.\nHe said he met Kutina in Goa around 2017 and they had been together, travelling between India and Ukraine, until they split.\nHe said he had left India this time around in March, and because of the war, he couldn’t come before this.\n\"When I heard the news, I booked a flight immediately to Bengaluru to try and meet them,\" said Mr. Goldstein.\nHe said Kutina wants to raise the children alone.\n\"She told me in the beginning itself that if I don’t live in the same house, I should not be in touch with them at all,\" claimed Mr. Goldstein.\nWhen they left Goa a few months ago, Mr. Goldstein said he filed a missing report with the police.\n\"But now, I want to push for shared custody,\" he added.\nMr. Goldstein said he has been supporting Kutina since she gave birth to his first daughter.\n\"I give her money every month and then come here to India to spend six months with them, as I have other obligations for the other six months. Also, the visa is only for six months,\" he added.\nMr. Goldstein said his younger daughter was born in India and that Kutina has been living here (in India) for nearly five years.\n\"As I understand, she [Ama] is a citizen of India and should not be deported,\" he said.\nThe girls, Prema (6) and Ama (4), were found with Kutina in a secluded cave in the Ramatirtha hills of Kumta taluk on July 11.\nThey were found living inside a cave in Gokarna during a routine inspection by the police after a landslide in the area.\nPolice had said that all three had lived in isolation for nearly three weeks before they were found.\nIn an earlier interview withPTI, Kutina said that her life in the cave was not as it was being portrayed in the media.\nShe also complained about the place where she and her daughters were taken after being moved from the cave.\n\"We are now kept in an uncomfortable place. It’s dirty, there’s no privacy, and we get only plain rice to eat. Many of our belongings were taken, including the ashes of my son, who passed away nine months ago,\" she toldPTIVideos."

Speaking toThe Hinduin New Delhi on Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Andri Boiko, Dubai-based immigration specialist and entrepreneur said pandemic, conflicts in West Asia and Ukraine, U.S. President Trump’s orders on U.S. citizenship rules and attraction of tax relief among high net worth individuals in the Global South are reshaping the immigration landscape of the world.\n“United Arab Emirates has started the golden visa scheme that will give ten year visa for high net worth individuals and for individuals with extraordinary skills from India and other countries. Argentina is also expected to start the golden visa scheme later this year,” said Mr. Boiko, explaining that the way global immigration rules are being redefined against the background of the tough changes that are being introduced by the U.S. administration.\nPresident Trump on January 20 issued Executive Order 14160“denying citizenship to persons born from a mother who was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) at the time of said person’s birth”. The order has been at the centre of a fierce debate and has been challenged in the court putting a question mark on the citizenship status of many U.S. citizens.\nMr. Boiko, who started ‘Garant In’ in 2009 as a citizenship and residency advisory service in Dubai, said changing rules and taxation are pushing more and more high achievers to find safe locations where they can ensure safety of their finances and conduct business without hindrance.\n“The UAE’s golden visa will give high net worth investors and high achievers from India and other countries the edge of Dubai while they will continue to be based in India,” said Mr. Boiko, adding, “You can get the golden visa without surrendering Indian passport and this will increasingly become a trend worldwide”.\nMr. Boiko pointed out that while some countries in the West are cracking down on illegal immigration from the Global South, there also some western countries especially Portugal, Italy, France in Europe who want to welcome high net worth individuals from major countries in the Global South. “Taxation, future security of finances and investment into the next generation, status symbol, are also among the reasons that are prompting high net worth people from the Global South to explore possibility of becoming a long term resident of a country like Italy and France,” said Mr. Boiko."

    "content": "The Union Cabinet on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) approved the “Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana”, or PMDDKY, to enhance agricultural productivity and increase adoption of sustainable agricultural practices across the country.\nThe scheme wasannounced in the Budget earlier this year. Talking to reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Centre has merged 36 schemes of 11 Ministries into the PMDDKY, which will have an outlay of ₹24,000 crore per year for six years beginning 2025-26. “This scheme will help 1.7 crore farmers,” he said.\nAlso read |Union Budget 2025: Schemes announced for farmers, middle class and students\nA release said the scheme also aims to augment post-harvest storage at the panchayat and block levels, improve irrigation facilities, and facilitate the availability of long-term and short-term credit. “The scheme will be implemented through the convergence of 36 existing schemes across 11 Departments, other State schemes, and local partnerships with the private sector... 100 districts will be identified based on three key indicators of low productivity, low cropping intensity, and less credit disbursement. The number of districts in each State/Union Territory will be based on the share of Net Cropped Area and operational holdings. However, a minimum of one district will be selected from each State,” the release added.\nThe PMDDKY is modelled on the “Aspirational District Programme” of the Centre. Mr. Vaishnaw said the “first-of-its-kind” scheme will focus exclusively on agriculture and allied sectors.\nCommittees for effective planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme will be formed at district, State and national levels. “A District Agriculture and Allied Activities Plan will be finalised by the District Dhan Dhaanya Samiti, which will also have progressive farmers as members. The district’s plans will be aligned to the national goals of crop diversification, conservation of water and soil health, and self-sufficiency in agriculture and allied sectors, as well as expansion of natural and organic farming,” the release said, adding that the scheme’s progress will be monitored on a monthly basis.\nAlso read |Agricultural agenda must move from food security to farmer prosperity: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar\nThe Government hoped that the scheme would result in higher productivity, value addition in agriculture and allied sectors, and local livelihood creation, and help increase domestic production and achieve self-reliance.\nAbhishek Jain, Fellow and Director, Green Economy and Impact Innovations, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said the scheme is a significant step toward boosting agricultural performance in India’s under-performing districts by emphasising not only productivity but also resilience through crop diversification, allied activities, value addition, soil health, and water‐use efficiency.\n“However, district selection could be improved by using annual net agricultural income per hectare,” he said, adding that the scheme should not focus on low-credit disbursement as an indicator for district selection. “A resilient agriculture system should not be dependent on credit. Instead, as we expand and diversify income streams for farmers via allied and value-added activities, and as we mainstream more sustainable agriculture practices, the reliance on external credit to fund cultivation cycles should come down, while still enhancing incomes for the farmers,” he said."

The restriction on the use of tractors on the corridor was imposed following reports that tractors were being driven in a rash and negligent manner along the crowded trekking path towards the temple, a Division Bench of Justices Anil K. Narendran and S. Muralee Krishna said while hearing a suo motu proceeding.\nThe senior government pleader submitted that the State Police  Chief had sought an explanation from Mr. Ajith Kumar on the incident. The court granted the government time to file an affidavit and posted the case for August 4.\nMeanwhile, the Pampa police registered a case against the driver on Wednesday for operating the vehicle recklessly and endangering public safety by transporting multiple individuals in a goods tractor. The FIR, however, did not mention the name of Mr. Ajith Kumar, sparking criticism and raising questions about accountability."

    "content": "Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti and J&K Peoples Conference (JKPC) chief Sajad Lone on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) opposed the move todrop Urdu as a mandatory subjectfor Naib-Tehsildar posts in Jammu and Kashmir.\n“It is deeply unfortunate that our judiciary appears to be influenced by divisive politics. Urdu, a recognised official language for decades, is now being unfairly communalised,” former J&K Chief Minister Ms. Mufti said in a post on social media platform X.\nJ&K’s revenue records and administrative work continued to be maintained in Urdu, she said. “It is only logical that applicants for the post of Naib Tehsildar possess basic proficiency in the language. This requirement is rooted purely in administrative efficiency not in any form of divisiveness,” Ms. Mufti said.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been protesting against the government notification issued in June to fill these posts. A Central Administrative Tribunal Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday passed an order to stay the operation of the provisions of the J&K Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, making knowledge of Urdu as the minimum qualification. It directed the J&K Services Selection Board to accept applications from all candidates who possess an undergraduate degree with knowledge of any of the five official languages in J&K.\n“The exclusion of Urdu as a qualifying requirement is part of a systematic marginalisation of the Kashmiri-speaking majority, and a dangerous step towards the ‘linguicide’ of Urdu,” Mr. Lone said.\nWith Urdu no longer needed to qualify for the post of Naib Tehsildar, “The majority Kashmiri-speaking population has been almost relegated to a footnote in the recruitment lists. Their presence in the recruitment lists is inversely proportional to their numbers. That is of course due to reservations,” Mr. Lone said.\nHe said that Urdu had historically given Kashmiri aspirants a reasonable edge in such posts because of the language’s relevance in administrative affairs. “It is a calculated move to erase regional linguistic roots. The onus of giving a good legal representation is on the incumbent elected government. Hope it is not yet another fixed match in a series of fixed matches that we are seeing lately,” Mr. Lone said."

Officials of the Kochi Corporation health wing the Minor Irrigation department said they did not receive any complaint about waterlogging from anywhere in the city except for the runoff water effect in some pockets.\n“Runoff water posed minor problems on some roads in Edakochi like Ambedkar Road and the Padashekharam Road,” said Abhilash Thoppil, councillor for the Edakochi South division.\nThe monsoon gathering further momentum spawned a nightmare for 77 families of the P&T Apartment Complex at Mundamveli, as their apartments continue to leak — a problem they have been facing since February 2024 whenever the rain intensifies. IIT Madras, appointed as the consultant to recommend solutions for the structural flaws in the building, is yet to issue the building stability certificate — a precondition for carrying out the truss work sanctioned by the district administration and to be executed by the Corporation — as well as the truss work design.\n“At least the truss work should be undertaken without any further delay.

    "content": "In an unusual move, the Tamil Nadu government is yet to send the list of Director-General of Police rank officers to the Union Public Service Commission for finalising the panel to appoint the next DGP/Head of Police Force.\nGoing by Supreme Court guidelines in the appointment of DGPs, the State Government should have sent the list of eligible officers to the UPSC three months before the incumbent DGP Shankar Jiwal’s retirement (August 30, 2025). Once the list of eligible officers is sent, the UPSC would prepare a panel of three officers fit for appointment as Head of Police Force and send it back to the State for picking one to the top post.\nTamil Nadu is among a few States that follow the apex court guidelines in the Prakash Singh case as regards appointment of DGPs/HoPF. It has been the practice since many years to send the list of IPS officers for UPSC empanelling and subsequent appointment. However, with just more than a month left for the present DGP to retire, there is no sign of the State initiating the process, police sources said.\nWhile there is an information that the State might amend the Tamil Nadu Police Act to enable appointment of an officer of its choice as DGP/HoPF, rumours are also agog that Mr. Shankar Jiwal may get an extension of three months with the approval of the Union Government.\nThe Supreme Court in its earlier order had directed the States to ensure that DGPs were appointed through a merit-based transparent process with a minimum tenure of two years irrespective of the date of superannuation.\nHowever, after some States appointed DGPs at the last minute giving them the benefit of a full two-year tenure, the court directed that appointing a person as DGP just before his or her retirement should be avoided. The court also ruled against the concept of appointing an officer as “acting DGP”. Despite specific guidelines, some States appointed “in-charge” DGPs or DGPs with “full additional charge” to bypass the requirement of seeking a panel from the UPSC.\nIn case the State Government sends a list of officers to the UPSC, the officers in the order of seniority who would qualify to be in the proposal are Seema Agrawal, Rajeev Kumar, Sandeep Rai Rathore, K. Vannia Perumal, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, G. Venkatraman, Vinit Dev Wankhede and Sanjay Mathur who are all in the level-16 pay matrix. Though in service, DGPs Pramod Kumar and Abhay Kumar Singh would not fit in the criteria of having a minimum of six months service left before retirement\nThough the police headquarters has written to the State Home Secretary that vacancy to the top post in the police force would arise on August 30, 2025, no decision has been taken yet on sending a proposal to the UPSC for finalising the panel. The UPSC’s selection committee is headed by its Chairman and includes the Union Home Secretary, the concerned State’s Chief Secretary and DGP, and one of the heads of the Central Armed Police Forces nominated by the MHA not belonging same State cadre as members, the sources said.\nWhether Tamil Nadu will deviate from the convention of complying with the Supreme Court guidelines in the appointment of DGPs and go ahead posting an officer of its choice to head the force remains to be seen."

The third edition of the job fair recorded a two-fold increase in attendance compared to the previous fair, which had attracted around 10,000 participants.\nMLA Mohammed Majid Hussain said that in the run-up to the job fair, training sessions were organised for aspirants covering various skills, including drafting resumes, and understanding how to avoid plagiarism in such documents.\n“There was a five-day training session, followed by a one-day training. If you see, youth often indulge in copy-pasting CVs. We wanted to ensure that they do not do this, and they are drafted in accordance with their skills and qualifications. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all CV,” Mr Hussain said, adding that the job fairs were part of AIMIM’s pre-election promise.\nWhile over 2,000 candidates received job offers on the spot, several hundred others are scheduled to appear for subsequent rounds of interviews at the companies’ offices. Mr Hussain expressed optimism that the number of final job offers would rise significantly in the coming weeks.\n“We will be doing this exercise every four or five months, and on the advice of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi. It is a labour and logistics-intensive initiative. From what we have understood, more such platforms are required. There is talent, and companies want such people,” he said.\nMukarram Ali Siddiqui, a member of Mr. Hussain’s team, pointed out the significant presence of women at the fair and noted that jobs suitable for differently-abled individuals were also available. “Job offers ranged from gig work to IT and IT-enabled services,” he said.\nThe AIMIM has indicated plans to continue holding such fairs at regular intervals to address the employment aspirations of the youth."

The inclusion in ground rest of light motor vehicles of angular parking, parallel parking, zig-zag driving, and gradient tests and the limiting of the number of driving tests conducted per day by one motor vehicle inspector (MVI) and one assistant MVI to 40. It also upheld the qualifications specified for driving school instructors.\nThe order was issued following a batch of petitions filed by the All Kerala Motor Driving School, Instructors and Workers Association and others challenging the circular and the subsequent government orders that introduced changes in the conduct of driving licence tests. The petitioners said that as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the power to make rules relating to the licensing and regulation of schools or establishments that imparted instruction in driving motor vehicles vested with the Union government and that the State cannot encroach upon the legislative domain exclusively assigned to the Centre. Upholding the contention, the court said that neither the State government nor the Transport Commissioner cant usurp the powers vested with the Centre in this regard."

After the project started operating in September 2011, the company paid 12% royalty for 12 years, but refused to pay an additional 6% royalty from September 2023.\nThe dispute reached the Himachal Pradesh High Court and the decision was given in favour of the company. The State government then challenged the order in the Supreme Court and got a favourable ruling.\nThe government is hopeful that this decision would also pave the way for other projects that have completed twelve years, which could generate an income of over ₹250 crore per year to the State treasury, the statement said."

It has also not permitted the enhancement of 800 MBBS seats in government medical colleges citing lack of necessary infrastructure and faculty recruitment.\n“We were hoping to get permission to start three new medical colleges and enhance medical seats in government medical colleges this year, but the NMC has rejected permission for both,” said B. L. Sujatha Rathod, Director, Directorate of Medical Education.\nThe Medical Education Department had submitted a proposal to establish three new medical colleges, including two government colleges and one private one — Ramanagara Institute of Medical Sciences in Ramanagara, Kanakapura Institute of Medical Sciences in Kanakapura, and Farooq Academy of Medical Sciences in Mysuru — this year.\nThe State government has been submitting proposals to start government medical colleges in Ramanagara and Kanakapura for the last three years. However, the NMC had denied permission to start the colleges in 2023-24 and 2024-2025 citing the same reasons.\nMedical colleges in Ramanagara and Kanakapura are championed by Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar who has held multiple meetings with Medical Education Minister Sharan Prakash Patil. Mr. Shivakuma has instructed to make the necessary preparations for the start of the new medical colleges. But, this year too, a request was submitted to start the colleges without appointing the required teaching staff."

    "content": "Canadian investors and businesses are looking at India with renewed optimism against the backdrop of attempts by both countries to recondition their bilateral ties, said Victor T. Thomas, president and CEO of the Canada-India Business Council.\n“The new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has certainly signalled the opportunity to engage with India, including inviting Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi to the G-7 Summit. In many ways, this was a reset in Canada-India relations, as trade diversification has been a major focus in Canada in 2025.”\nThis gesture was more than symbolic — it demonstrated a strategic recognition of India’s growing global economic importance. PM Carney’s tone and early actions have re-established some trust on the India file and reignited some bilateral momentum. The business community sees this as an opportunity to rebuild and grow the commercial relationship and hopefully finally sign an Early Progress Trade Agreement after our closest allies, like Australia, and most recently, the U.K., have paved the way,” Mr. Thomas said.\nMr. Thomas said that the business community is encouraged by recent signals arising from the meeting of the Prime Ministers and the move to restore the respective High Commissioners in Ottawa and New Delhi. India and Canada withdrew their respective High Commissioners in 2024, following allegations that Indian agents had orchestrated the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada.\n“The business community values stability and predictability and has continued to make deals and stay active despite recent diplomatic challenges. These are encouraging signals for long-term business planning and I’m cautiously optimistic that relations will continue to improve,” said Mr. Thomas.\nAccording to Mr. Thomas, India presents enormous potential for Canadian firms looking to diversify beyond the U.S. market. Canada and the U.S. are locked in a trade war. “Canadian companies already active in India are seeing real success, on the investment side of things, particularly in infrastructure and real estate. This year, investments from Canada into India — both direct and indirect — hovers around CA $100 billion! There are still many untapped opportunities to explore and with complementary strengths in sectors like agri-food, energy, education, and resources, there’s far more we can achieve together,” he said."

This follows instances reported during the seat allotment process last year, where students tried to misuse the quota by submitting sponsorship from people who are not directly related to them.\nTo prevent such misuse and help genuine candidates who have blood relative sponsors, the KEA has issued a circular informing students and parents that for NRI ward sponsors, it is compulsory to transfer the sponsor amount from the sponsor’s account directly to KEA.\n“In case the candidate finds it difficult to transfer the amount immediately, then they can submit a Demand Draft (DD) for the same amount to KEA and get their admission order. The DD will be returned as soon as the sponsor transfers the amount,” it said.\nThis year, KEA has also made it mandatory for NRI ward quota claimers to get the family tree certified from respective tehsildars. Last year, KEA had received over 500 applications claiming seats under NRI ward, of which 320 were found eligible and during the second level of verification 14 candidates were found submitting fake documents to claim the quota."

Even the security failed to maintain the dignity of the court.\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi with Uttar Pradesh party President Ajay Rai at the special MP/MLA court for a hearing in a defamation case filed over the former’s purported remarks on Army personnel.

In Lucknow, Mr. Gandhi’s security was compromised for more than three hours.”\nMultiple videos of huge crowd inside the courtroom with Mr. Gandhi and within court premises went viral, with people even taking selfies.\nThe Congress said the authorities should look into the matter. “I was not present there, but the security of Rahulji, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, is the responsibility of the Home Ministry and the State government. Any breakdown in security is not acceptable,” said Imran Masood, Congress MP.\nOn July 15, Mr. Gandhi appeared before the MP/MLA Special Court in Lucknow in connection with a case of allegedly making a defamatory statement against the Indian Armed Forces during his Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022. The Congress leader, who surrendered in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Alok Verma, was granted bail after the court allowed his application."

    "content": "The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is set to float a tender for the third time to microchip stray dogs, even as a charitable trust has moved the High Court to challenge the project. The matter is currently sub judice.\nAccording to the tender proposal, the project is estimated to cost ₹3.23 crore. Of this, ₹3.09 crore is allocated for procuring 1,62,817 microchips and ₹14.85 lakh is set aside for purchasing 50 microchip readers. A BBMP official overseeing the project explained that each microchip, measuring around 1–1.5 mm, will be injected into the first layer of a dog’s skin near the neck using a hypodermic needle. This procedure will be carried out by specialists working under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. As the official noted, the selected contractor will be required to procure the microchips, which are not manufactured in India, and also provide software for storing and managing the associated data.\n“Procurement will take place in phases as we complete implanting the previously procured microchips. We will inform the contractor in advance, and they will be responsible for supplying the next batch,” the official toldThe Hindu, adding that while there is no fixed deadline, the project is expected to be completed within one or two years. The contractor is also required to provide software services, which the BBMP will access for free for a period of one year. After that, the contractor will submit an annual cost estimate, and the BBMP will subscribe accordingly.\nAccording to BBMP officials, only two known contractors, one from Gujarat and one from Mumbai, currently meet the eligibility criteria. Suralkar Vikas Kishor, Special Commissioner (Health and Animal Husbandry), BBMP, stated that the first tender, floated in February last year, received no bids. A second tender was issued later that year and awarded to a contractor, but he failed to meet the software service requirements specified in the tender.\nMeanwhile, the BBMP conducted a pilot project in which microchips were implanted in 500 stray dogs. An audit conducted 15 days later showed no adverse effects on the dogs, and the chips functioned effectively, according to Mr. Kishor. Each microchip will contain a GPS tracker and a Unique Identification Number (UIN), enabling BBMP officials to locate microchipped dogs. The UIN will store data, including vaccination details, the dog’s location, and photographs, all of which will be stored on a server accessible via the software.\nAnimal rights activist Arun Prasad called the project illegal. “ABC rules do not permit the implantation of microchips in free-roaming stray dogs. They only allow private dog owners to microchip their pets for identification purposes,” said Mr. Prasad. A Bengaluru-based charitable trust has filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court challenging the project. The case is currently under judicial consideration."

He released the video showing the dead venomous stinger in halwa with the voice accusing the shop for allegedly not showing due attention in preparing and packing the sweet.\n“Since the shop has sold halwa with venomous scorpion, I’m planning to approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum,” the voice says.\nAfter this disturbing visual was shared on social media, officials attached to the Department of Food Safety inspected the shop and the kitchen where halwa is prepared.\n“We’ve served notice to the halwa shop and shared the visuals with the owner of the shop seeking his clarification on this issue. Based on our findings, we’ve asked the shop owner to take a few measures to ensure better housekeeping like fixing mesh in the windows and other holes in the kitchen through which the insects can enter. We’ve also lifted samples from the kitchen and sent for analysis. Based on the analysis report and our findings in the shop, due action will follow,” Designated Food Safety Officer, Tirunelveli, Pushparaj, said.\nThe halwa shop workers categorically denied that there was no chance for a scorpion getting packed along with halwa.\n“We maintain superior cleanliness in the kitchen at any given time. Since halwa would be very hot when it is packed, it would even burn your skin if a small portion accidentally falls on you. So, no insect will come even closer to the hot pan. As we suspect foul play in this issue, we’re planning to file a complaint with the police since this incident should not tarnish our credibility,” said sources in the shop."

The PM is scheduled to address a public meeting at Gandhi Maidan in Motihari. “This would be PM Modi’s 53rdvisit to Bihar and sixth to Motihari in the last 11 years. For earlier Prime Ministers, Bihar was never a priority,” Mr. Jaiswal added.

The PM will also flag off three trains.\nFormer BJP MP from East Champaran Radha Mohan Singh said that “people from as many as 24 assembly constituencies of the region are likely to participate on Friday, to make it an unparalleled event.”\nDistrict administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the forthcoming visit of the Prime Minister at Motihari. “As many as 15 IPS officers, over four dozen Dy SPs, 100 Inspector rank officials, and over 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel will be deployed during the PM’s visit,” a senior police official at the state headquarters in Patna said. Top administrative officials have already visited the place, he added.\n“The Prime Minister’s visit to East Champaran will definitely enthuse and boost the morale of our grassroots party leaders and workers. Yes, the PM is our star campaigner for the party ahead of the assembly elections,” a state BJP leader asserted. “He will keep coming before the polls, and his visits will definitely, uplift our party leaders and workers’ morale,” he added. Several public meetings have been scheduled for the Prime Minister in Bihar over the next two months, ahead of the assembly elections.\nMeanwhile, Opposition leaders see nothing “unusual” in the Prime Minister’s regular visits to the election-bound State. “This is an election year, and every party leader is expected to address public meetings. But the Prime Minister should also speak about basic issues of unemployment, and migration, confronting the State. Of late, the law-and-order situation in the State has become alarming, and the PM must say something on this as well,” leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said. Mr. Yadav has regularly been raising public issues and making announcements on providing jobs and promoting industrialisation in the state. “But the Prime Minister will keep talking about the jungle raj issue to mislead common people,” RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said.\nOpposition leaders also wanted the PM to address the “chaos & confusion” caused by the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state, the RJD leaders said. Earlier, Mr. Yadav had accused the Election Commission of “working on behalf of the BJP.”\nJD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar countered, “He is the Prime Minister of the country, not only Bihar. He has to look after the development of the State along with the country. We welcome his visit to the state.”"

    "content": "India may have achieved an important milestone of sourcing 50% of its electric power capacity, or about 484 gigawatts, from non fossil-fuel sources, though publicly available data show that the share of clean energy in the electricity actually supplied is below 30%.\n“India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources — five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] to the Paris Agreement,” Pralhad Joshi, Minister for New and Renewable Energy, said earlier this week. “This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development, and signals that India’s clean energy transition is not only real but also accelerating under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”\nIn 2014, the share of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, biomass, hydropower (small and large) and nuclear power – constituted about 30% of India’s installed electricity capacity. As on June 30, 2025 – as per the Centre – it rose to 50%. However, the share of electricity generated from these sources rose from 17% in 2014-15 to 28% in the May 2025-26 period.\nTo be sure, the quantum of clean energy (non-fossil) produced annually has risen quite significantly from 190 billion units in 2014-15 to 460 billion units in 2024-25.\nExperts say that despite the rise in clean energy, the slower increase in utilising clean energy was due to the “capacity utilisation factor” (CUF), a measure of how much available energy was usable. CUF values for clean energy have been lower than that of coal or nuclear sources. “While solar and wind now make up a large share of installed capacity, their CUFs are much lower. Solar has CUF of approximately 20% and wind around 25-30%, compared to coal’s 60% or nuclear’s 80%. This means their contribution to actual generation remains limited despite high installed capacity,” said Arunendra kumar Tiwari, Fellow, The Energy Resources Institute.\nBase load demand, or power that is available through the day, is largely provided by coal, which makes up about 75% of India’s energy mix. While there was a rise in solar energy utilisation and easing demand on coal during the daytime, particularly in summer, was unavailable in the evening.\n“To improve utilisation of solar, we primarily need two things: flexibility in the grid and improved battery storage. Right now we pay the same (per unit) for electricity, whether night or day. Much like in the early days of telecom, when night calls were cheaper, we need to experiment with differential tarrifs for electricity during the day.\nThis however will require smart grids and better management,” said Saurabh Kumar, vice-president, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and an expert on energy, “We have several schemes that are being working on and in the next one or two years, I expect there will be significant improvement.”\nIn the days ahead, an increase in ‘hybrid’ power projects that combine solar, wind, hydro and storage elements to meet India’s growing peak and round-the-clock power needs are the way forward, says a policy note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “When paired with battery storage, these hybrids can store surplus energy and release it during peak demand hours, particularly in the evening. However, deployment is currently limited by challenges such as land-aggregation issues, lack of coordinated transmission planning, and high cost of storage components.”"

Recent successes in Chhattisgarh include the killing of general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju (70) who was neutralised by security forces in Narayanpur on May 21 and in a departure from the previous years, operations are continuing in monsoon this year.\n“Significantly, the Dandakaranya region, which spans parts of Bastar Range districts and Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra, has been identified as the area of maximum damage, with 281 Maoists neutralised in the past one year alone,” the IG said. Out of the 357 deceased, 136 were women cadres.\n“As per the vision of the Government of India and the Government of Chhattisgarh, the security forces are adopting a pro-people and development-centric approach.

Sharma Oli to New Delhi is being planned shortly after his return.\nMr. Modi was expected to travel to the U.K. to sign the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but officials said the trip, which is still being planned for July 24, has not been “finalised” and could be delayed.\nMr. Modi is expected to land in Male on July 25, and will be given a ceremonial welcome. He will hold bilateral talks with Maldives’ President Mohamed Muizzu, who visited India in June 2024 for Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony and then for a State visit in October. Among a number of development initiatives, both sides are expected to build on the launch of digital payment system UPI and mechanisms to increase tourist arrivals between both countries, officials working on the visit said.\nOn July 26, Mr. Modi has been invited as a guest to the Independence Day parade and other special ceremonies to mark 60 years of the Maldives getting independence from the British in 1965. The invitation was announced by Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India in May this year.\nOfficials said that India and the U.K. have also been discussing a short visit to London by Mr. Modi before he travels to Male, on July 24, to sign the FTA that was announced by him and Mr. Starmer on May 6. However, it is understood that some technical and “legal scrubbing” is still required to be finished, and the trip may require to be put off or held after the Male visit.\nThe visit to the Maldives is significant as it marks Mr. Modi’s first visit to the neighbouring country since the election of Mr. Muizzu in November 2023. Ties between India and Maldives hit a rough patch over the “India Out” campaign that Mr. Muizzu had backed during his campaign, and the “Boycott Maldives” social media campaign that followed over criticism of Mr. Modi by Maldivian Ministers.\nHowever, the two sides subsequently resolved issues, after India agreed to replace military personnel stationed there for aircraft management with civilian engineers. India has also increased its Lines of Credit and outlay to Maldives from ₹470 crore in 2024-25 to ₹600 crore in the latest budget, and extended a much needed currency swap facility to help Maldives with its debt repayment crisis last year.\nDiplomatic sources further said that India is expected to host Nepal’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli later this month and that discussions are on.\nMr. Oli was one of the first regional leaders to condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam and, subsequently, India accommodated Nepalese citizens while airlifting stranded nationals from Iran against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict.\nMr. Oli in recent months, has also praised India for supporting the democratic process in post-monarchy Nepal. While plans are underway for the visit, there are also internal political developments in Nepal that will be taken into consideration at the planning stage. On Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N), withdrew support to Mr. Oli’s government, reducing the ruling coalition to a minority in the Upper House of the Nepalese Parliament — National Assembly.\nMr. Oli’s India proposed visit has acquired heightened attention as he was sworn in on July 15, 2024 but has not visited India till now, but had visited China in December last year."

    "content": "DMK Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva’s controversial comments that former Chief Minister and Congress stalwart K. Kamaraj wouldn’t sleep without an air conditioner and that he held the hands of  DMK patriarch  M. Karunanidhi in his (Kamaraj’s) final days and urged him to ‘protect democracy’ have caused some unease within the DMK-Congress alliance. TNCC president K. Selvaperunthagai and party Karur MP S. Jothimani have criticised Mr. Siva for his remarks.\nMr. Selvaperunthagai said nobody had the right to question or speak in such a manner about  Kamaraj. “He (Siva) is speaking without any evidence. Leave him. Nobody is qualified to criticise Kamarajar,” he said.\nMs. Jothimani said Kamaraj was not only known for his honesty and administrative skills, but also for his simplicity, and added that he was defeated in elections because of  myths spread by the DMK.\n“He travelled to every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu. . These nooks and corners  do not have air conditioned rooms or five-star hotels. As a Chief Minister, Kamaraj stayed in the government hostels and even slept under a tree when the heat was too much,”  she said. Mr Siva’s statements were “completely untrue.”\n“Kamaraj’s soul will not forgive us if we do not give a proper response to the myths spread against him. Every Congress worker should remember that the party is still standing in the political field in Tamil Nadu because of him.”\nReacting to Mr Siva’s comments, TMC (Moopanar) leader G.K. Vasan said the party was pained over this and strongly condemned them. “Kamaraj is instrumental for the growth attained by Tamil Nadu today. His tenure was known as the golden rule. He was a role model known for his simplicity and integrity. Therefore, such wrong statements (by Mr. Siva) should not have been made,” Mr. Vasan said.\nLater in the day, Mr. Siva requested that his remarks on Kamaraj not be turned into a debate, adding that he held the late leader in high regard.\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Tiruchi Velusamy’s comments at a public rally in Manaparai that only a coalition government is feasible in Tamil Nadu after the 2026 Assembly election raised some eyebrows. “We are not saints. Our intention is to attain power in Tamil Nadu. If my prediction is right, the next government can only be a coalition government and two Congressmen will be ministers. First let us become ministers in Tamil Nadu and then capture power in the State,” he said.\nReacting to it, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said, “This may be his view. But, anything related to seat sharing or sharing of power will be decided by the Congress leadership.”"

    "content": "The launch of the Ungaludan Stalin Scheme (USS) by the DMK regime has prompted the AIADMK to liken it to the Assured Maximum Service to Marginal People in All Villages (AMMA) scheme, which was implemented by the previous AIADMK government when Jayalalithaa was Chief Minister.\nAt least on two occasions in the last couple of days, the general secretary of the principal Opposition party, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is on a State-wide tour, called the new scheme an instance of the DMK government resorting to “pasting stickers” on what was carried out by his party while in power. On Tuesday, former Revenue Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, too, made the same point in a social media post. According to the policy note of the Revenue Department for 2020-21, around 64.15 lakh petitions were received at 64,079 camps during 2012-2020, of which 64.09 lakh petitions were disposed of.\nThe two schemes have a common objective - providing government services at the people’s doorstep. Apart from redressing the grievances of the people, both the schemes pave the way for enrolment of new beneficiaries under various schemes. For example, about 10 years ago, the registration of farmers under the Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana) and individuals under Aadhaar was given priority. Currently, the coverage of new beneficiaries under the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai (KMUT), a basic income scheme for women heads of families, is being given importance.\nStill, the two schemes differ in scope, according to a perusal of the government orders issued in March 2013 (on the AMMA scheme), and in June 2025 (on USS). The key difference between the two schemes is that while the former took care of only those in rural areas, the latter will cover people in urban areas, too. As per the G.O. issued by the Public (Mudhalvarin Mugavari) Department on June 19, a total of 10,000 camps would be held in the next four months (till November). In urban areas, 3,768 camps would be conducted and, in rural areas, 6,232. Among districts, Salem accounts for the highest number of camps at 432, followed by Chennai (400) and Tiruvallur (389).\nClarifying that the current government’s latest initiative is an improved version of Makkaludan Mudhalvar, which was inaugurated in urban areas in November 2023 and extended to the remaining areas gradually, P. Amudha, Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue and Disaster Management), told The Hindu that the USS had been launched with a “door-to-door campaign”.\nTo a query on the continuance of Ungalai Thedi Ungal Ooril, another outreach programme of the government launched in January 2024, wherein Collectors would stay in a given taluk on a designated day for 24 hours to take up field visits, interact with the public, and get feedback on government schemes, Ms. Amudha said it would resume “after the USS camps”.\nWouldn’t the system of providing services to the people online, without direct interface with officials, be better than the conventional way of holding camps, receiving petitions, and disposing of them? To this, the official said that “due to illiteracy and lack of clarity” among sections of petitioners, “supporting documents” were not attached while applying online. This had led to the rejection of a number of applications."

Initial inquiry revealed that, based on orders of Asra Garg, IGP (North Zone), special teams were formed as part of a crackdown on drug trafficking.\nFollowing an alert, special police teams were conducting surprise vehicle checks around public places when they saw the trio loitering at the railway station in a suspicious way. When questioned, the trio gave contradictory answers on their purpose of travel and later confessed that they were waiting to upload ganja consignment to Chennai by train. Subsequently, police checked their jute bags and found ganja.\nWalajah police registered a case and lodged them at the Central Prison in Vellore. It was found that the seized ganja was meant to sell in retail among workers in industrial sites in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Puducherry. A probe is underway."

    "content": "Fish farming in an irrigation tank, which is maintained by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), at Melathikkan village near Tiruvannamalai town has been revived for the season due to rain in recent weeks, resulting in steady rise of waterflow to the tank.\nAccompanied by Collector K. Tharpagaraj, Minister for Public Works and Highways E.V. Velu released young fish in the tank on Wednesday as part of fish cultivation by farmers in the region.\nOfficials of the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation (TNFDC), which maintains fish farms in the district, said that fish cultivation, including harvesting, is done during May to August due to the steady reduction of hot weather and gradual rise in water level due to south-west monsoon.\nThese months also help to retain adequate oxygen in the farming area of the tank due to slow evaporation. Also, as the water level is almost steady, fishing in the waters in the tank remains safe for fishermen. “Local fishermen from the neighbouring Edapalayam village have been doing the job for many years. Such roping of local skilled workers helps to prevent poaching and also provides jobs for them,” S. Velan, Assistant Director (AD), Department of Fisheries (Tiruvannamalai), toldThe Hindu.\nAt Melathikkan tank, Catla, Roya and Mithila are the preferred freshwater fish varieties that are cultivated with acumen, involving local fishermen and officials of the fisheries department. These fish varieties were chosen at least for two reasons - speedy growth and good taste, especially for spicy fish curries. They weighed over one kg in three months after they were left in the tank. As per norms, each hectare of tank area, on average, should release around 2,000 fish should be released to maintain the fish growth in the tank. In other words, 60% of the total area of the tank should be the total number of fish released.\nDivided into forenoon and afternoon, fishing in the tank will be done by 18 units of local fishermen, closely monitored by the officials. Each unit has at least two fishermen in a coracle with a target of 20kg per team everyday.\nIn other words, fishing in the tank should yield at least 0.5 tonnes (500 kgs) daily especially during the peak month of August. These fishermen are paid on a daily basis. Of the total catch, one-third goes for local consumption with the rest goes to the government-run stalls and buyers in the State."

    "content": "Common Service Centres (CSCs) around the country will receive free Artificial Intelligence training, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, told a packed gathering of Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) who run the tech centres on Tuesday (July 15, 2025). Mr. Vaishnaw also said that the government would address duplication issues posed by States’ own digital service centres. The Minister was speaking at the annual CSC Diwas, where VLEs from around the country gather.\nCSCs are key in making online government services and websites available to people living in remote areas. Lalremruata, 29, a VLE in Lawngtlai, Mizoram had “facilitated business worth over ₹8 crore through his CSC in the financial year 2024–25,” the government said in an award citation. Mr. Lalremruata was felicitated at the event alongside other VLEs working in remote districts. There are over 5.6 lakh CSCs in India, and over four-fifths of them are in rural areas.\nWhile Mr. Vaishnaw and Minister of State for IT Jitin Prasada spoke, much of the VLEs’ enthusiastic applause went to Bhuvnesh Kumar, who is the chief executive officer of the Aadhaar issuing Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). CSCs have not been able to perform enrolments and major updates for Aadhaar since 2018, following an order of the Supreme Court.\nStill, VLEs hope to regain that business, as Aadhaar enrolment and updates are a potentially high volume business. Mr. Prasada and Mr. Vaishnaw said they would look into the issue, but did not commit themselves to reopening all Aadhaar enrolment and update activities to CSCs just yet (VLEs can only perform address and other “demographic” updates for the moment).\n“Don’t clap until the work is done,” Mr. Prasada said. Mr. Vaishnaw said he would discuss the issue with Mr. Kumar.\nMr. Prasada pointed to the issue of cybersecurity, and urged VLEs to work with the government on the issue. India has seen major digitisation, he said. “But with such big achievements, there are equally big challenges and those challenges are of cyber security in which you will also play a very important role to equip the people of India,” he said. “All these things are related to the security of the country. We should take care of the people and there should be a constant dialogue.”"
