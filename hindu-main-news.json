    "content": "The Bombay High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) rejected and refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) petition alleging that Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi violated the petitioner’s rights by making “immature” remarks about Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The petition sought the court to issue directions to the Congress leader that he should read his petition and learn about Savarkar before making “irresponsible” statements.\nThe 125-page petition, filed by Professor Pankaj K. Phadnis, 65, from Mumbai and the founding president of Abhinav Bharat Congress, a public policy think tank, mentioned history and research work by the petitioner on Savarkar.\nThe petitioner said that Mr. Gandhi, in London in March 2023, had tried to paint Savarkar as someone who takes pleasure in the humiliation of Muslims.\nHe further said that Mr. Gandhi tried to portray Savarkar as a coward and in a derogatory reference at a press conference held on March 25, 2023, where he said, “My name is not Savarkar, I am Gandhi and Gandhi does not make apologies to anyone.”\n“Rahul Gandhi is LoP in Lok Sabha and could well become Prime Minister of India in the future. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to take liberties with facts to denigrate respected leaders of freedom struggle and prevent the young from being in a position to fulfil their fundamental duties. The only way to prevent him from causing harm to the nation is by an expert such as the petitioner to step into the box, depose comprehensive facts about Shri Savarkar and allow himself to be cross examined by Rahul Gandhi to establish facts once and for all,” the petitioner said, asking the court to direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of his petition and learn about Savarkar.\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that the Supreme Court had already dismissed a similar petition filed by Mr. Phadnis and said that the court could not direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of the petition and remove his ignorance about Vinayak Savarkar. “In your petition, your prayer is to direct him to personally study and read your petition. How can the court compel him to read your petition? This court cannot issue directions to Rahul Gandhi to study the contents of this petition and remove ignorance about the contribution of Savarkar. We do not know if he will become Prime Minister or not. Do you know that he will become the Prime Minister?“ the Bench noted and disposed of the petition.\nThe court noted that a criminal defamation case had already been filed against Mr. Gandhi by Satyaki Savarkar, grand nephew of Vinayak Savarkar, and that the same was pending before a special MP/MLA Court in Pune."

He also wanted the officials to  create co-working spaces across the 26 district centres for small enterprises coming to the State.\nHe said the proposed Ratan Tata Innovation Hub, which is being developed to foster modern innovation and to promote startups in the State, would be inaugurated soon and asked the officials to take necessary steps to establish regional spoke centres in Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur.\nHe said that in alignment with the Amaravati Quantum Valley, partnerships with companies like TCS, L&T and IBM had already been formed and the officials should finalise essential infrastructure for the partners. Referring to the proposed ‘Drone City’ project at Orvakal in Kurnool district, spanning 400 acres in the coming year, Mr. Lokesh instructed the officials to create an ecosystem to support it.\nHe also wanted wide promotion to the ‘Mana Mitra’ WhatsApp governance services launched by the government. He said that out of the total 702 State services, 535 of them were currently being offered through ‘Mana Mitra’ app. He said steps should be taken to ensure internet connectivity in all the 45,000 government schools and uninterrupted phone connectivity at airports in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajamahendravaram."

    "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) held celebrations in Jammu and Kashmir over the Central Administrative Tribunal’s (CAT) decision to drop Urdu as a mandatory qualification for candidates applying to Naib-Tehsildar posts in the Union Territory.\nA bench of the CAT’s Jammu Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday stayed the operation of provisions in the Jammu and Kashmir Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, which stipulated graduation with knowledge of Urdu as a minimum qualification for the post.\nThe tribunal directed the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) to accept applications from candidates with knowledge of any of the five official languages listed in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the order, the JKSSB on Tuesday deferred the process of inviting applications for the posts.\nUnder the Official Languages Act, 2020, enacted during Central rule, Hindi, Kashmiri, English, Dogri, and Urdu were declared as official languages in Jammu and Kashmir. Prior to the reorganisation of the former State in 2019, Urdu was the sole official language.\nCelebrations were held at Srinagar’s Ghanta Ghar by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, where its president Arun Prabhat welcomed the tribunal’s order. He said the government’s earlier notification to continue with Urdu as a mandatory subject was discriminatory.\n“The notice was anti-Constitution. Our Constitution preamble with Article 14 and 16 are for equal opportunity for all and against any discrimination on the basis of colour, creed or caste. The J&K government notice was discriminatory to four out of five languages declared as official languages here,” Mr. Prabhat said.\nReacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed Ur Rehman Para accused the BJP of politicising the Urdu language and “injecting communal overtones into the discourse around Jammu and Kashmir’s linguistic heritage”.\n“BJP’s attempt to view Urdu through a communal lens marks a dangerous and disgraceful new low in our political discourse in J&K. Urdu is not a symbol of any religion but the throbbing pulse of Jammu & Kashmir’s identity, echoing collective memories and soulful struggles of our people over centuries,” Mr. Para said in a post on social media platform X.\nHe said that Urdu is the language of poets, courts, revenue offices, administration, and everyday life in Jammu and Kashmir. “Even more disturbing is the CAT’s order staying the requirement of basic Urdu knowledge for the Naib Tehsildar exam — a signal that judicial forums too are beginning to cave under political pressure,” he added.\nThe PDP, Mr. Para said, stood for the preservation of the region’s linguistic and cultural identity. “Urdu must be preserved, not just as a language, but as an embodiment of our shared heritage, administrative continuity & cultural essence that binds every region of J&K together.”"

    "content": "Air India will partially resume international flights from August 1, after the “safety pause” necessitated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 fleet following thedeadly crash of AI-171 on June 12. A full restoration of flights across its global network is planned from October 1, the airline said in a press statement.\nThe airline also announced that it will be moving three out of its five weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London’s Gatwick airport to the British capital’s Heathrow airport instead, for a period of two months from August 1.\nBetween July 16 and August 1, the airline will restore seven flights to destinations such as London, Zurich, Tokyo, and Seoul. During the same period, the airline will operate 13 fewer flights to European destinations as compared to its full schedule, and 20 fewer flights to the U.S. and Canada. Destinations in Australia will continue to see four fewer flights. Some services to London and Singapore will remain suspended till September 30.\nThe DGCA had ordered enhanced checks for Air India’s 33 Boeing 787 aircraft, which had led to long delays and cancellations of flights, inviting flak from passengers.\nFollowing the DGCA’s intervention, Air India announced it was curtailing 15% of its internatIonal flights due to disruptions caused due to a combination of factors, including airspace closures over Pakistan and the Middle East. The cut was announced for a period of a month, and later extended until the end of July.\nTuesday’s (July 15, 2025) announcement also follows last week’s interim probe report into the June 12 crash that killed 260 people. The report did not recommend any extra measures for either the aircraft type or its engines.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson told airline employees on an internal platform that all Boeing 787s had been checked since the crash, and were found “fit-to-fly”. Since the interim report found that the lock on the switches that supply fuel to the two engines had moved or “transitioned” before both engines shut down, the airline has also started inspecting the lock feature for the fuel control switches. This exercise has been carried out for 50% of Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet.\nOn Monday (July 14, 2025), the DGCA ordered all airlines with Boeing aircraft to carry out this inspection by July 21."

    "content": "The unemployment rate (UR) among people aged 15 and above has remained the same at 5.6% in May and June 2025, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation here on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nWomen’s participation in labour force, both in urban and rural areas, decreased by one percentage point in June compared with May. The government said there is a “marginal decline” in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men too.\nThe Ministry said the LFPR in current weekly status (CWS) among all persons aged 15 and above was 54.2 % during June this year as compared to 54.8% during May 2025. “The LFPR in rural areas was 56.1% and LFPR in urban areas was 50.4% during June 2025 for persons of the same age group,” the Ministry said. The LFPR for males aged 15 and above in rural and urban areas were respectively 78.1% and 75% during June 2025, and it marked a marginal decline from the corresponding LFPR estimates of 78.3% and 75.1% respectively for rural and urban areas during May 2025.\nFor females, the LFPR for age 15 years and above for rural areas was 35.2% in June 2025. This was 36.9% in May and 38.2% in April. In urban areas, the LFPR for females aged above 15 was 25% in June. It was 25.3% in May. For females of all age groups in both rural and urban areas, the LFPR was 24.5% in June and it was 25.5% in May.\nThe unemployment rate for females and males of all ages above 15 was 5.6%. While for men, the rate remained same as of May, for females there was a decrease in UR by 0.1 percentage point. While the rural unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the urban unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points between May and June.\nThe worker population ratio (WPR) for people of all ages above 15 in both urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 38.7% compared to 39% in May.\nThe Union Government said the marginal decline in LFPR and WPR in June was largely influenced by seasonal agricultural patterns, intense summer heat limiting outdoor physical work, and a shift of some unpaid helpers, particularly from higher-income rural households, towards domestic chores. It said the share of rural female workers in agriculture dropped from 70.2% in May to 69.8% in June, indicating the reduced need for agricultural engagement among women, “perhaps due to a decline in rural inflation”.\nThe Ministry had started releasing monthly figures of employment and unemployment data since April for a better perspective of the situation. “The number of households surveyed was 89,493 (49,335 in rural areas and 40,158 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 3,80,538 (2,17,251 in rural areas and 1,63,287 in urban areas),” the Ministry said."

Mr. Rana has not yet attained the age of 65.\nHowever, Mr. Rana’s counsel, advocate Piyush Sachdeva, submitted that the accused is 64 years and six months old and suffers from medical conditions that warrant special consideration.\nThe NIA informed the court that it has submitted Mr. Rana’s complete medical history to the jail authorities.\nThe matter has been posted for further hearing on July 25.\nExtradited from the United States on April 10, Mr. Rana, 64, is facing trial in connection with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which left more than 166 people dead.\nThe NIA, which is investigating the case, has charged Mr. Rana with conspiring in the attacks along with his associate David Headley. Headley, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, is accused of conducting planning and reconnaissance for the attacks at the behest of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed."

He also favoured reservation in private sector.\n“We must demand political representation and ensure that backward classes will have a proportional voice in all decision-making bodies. Economic opportunities should be expanded through reservation in private sector jobs, government promotions and contracts, financial support and schemes, and access to markets,” he told the delegates at the first meeting of the council here on Tuesday.\n“Awareness campaigns to combat discrimination and ensure social integration, build a strong sense of backward class consciousness, which brings awareness of social reality, strength in numbers and right to equality. This political awakening will fuel aspiration, solidarity and long- term change,” he said, outlining the responsibility for the council, which comprises 24 leaders, including former Chief Ministers, former Ministers and Members of Parliament.\nThe council has been set by the AICC to deliberate and strategise party’s response in the OBC politics across the country and woo back the OBC voters to the party fold.\nMr. Siddaramaiah, a member of the panel, said the Council must become a platform that transforms socio economic and educational caste census from a political debate into constitutional necessity. “It should provide space that ensures backward classes voices shape policy, not just manifestos and a force that mobilises intellectual capital, youth energy and grassroots strength to build leadership emerging from the oppressed classes.” He said the council is not a formality, but “soul of India’s social justice movement... We should remind the country that AHINDA is not a vote bank, but it is the voice of India’s conscience.”\nAttacking the BJP and Sangha Parivar, the Chief Minister said, “They may polarise India through caste division, but we will win back India through social unity and constitutional justice. They treat OBCs as mere symbols, We uplift them as equals.”  At every step, BJP opposed Congress’s social justice efforts not just politically, but ideologically too, undermining equity and resisting OBC empowerment out of discomfort for true backward class advancement, he added.\nAmong those present in the meeting, which will continue its deliberations on Wednesday, were Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanswamy. The council will deliberate on the national caste census, a demand by the Congress and OBC oriented welfare programmes in the country."

The protest is to highlight the DMK government’s failure to implement 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Incidentally, Dr. Ramadoss’s residence is located at Thailapuram in Villupuram district.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, sources close to Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani  said fatigue had set in among the party cadre because of the feud, and this could affect the party’s performance in the 2026 Assembly election.\n“However, the protest against the DMK government would be huge. In 1995, Dr. Ramadoss declared that the then DMK president, M.  Karunanidhi, would be the next Chief Minister and presented him with a yellow shawl at Villupuram. Thirty-five years later, his son Dr. Anbumani  will demand the ouster of the DMK and Karunanidhi’s son, M.K. Stalin, from power for their failure to implement the internal reservation for the Vanniyars,” PMK spokesperson K. Balu said.\nAnother senior PMK leader close to Dr. Ramadoss said he hoped Dr. Anbumani would step back. “Who is going to be the biggest loser if the party’s vote share dwindles and voters switch to other parties? It is going to be Dr. Anbumani who is the future of this party,” he said."

This was 1,579 cusecs higher than Monday’s release of 50,369 cusecs.\nFor the first time during this monsoon, Maharashtra released 5,500 cusecs of water from the Koyna dam into the river Krishna on Tuesday.\nThe dam authorities managing the inflow are trying to balance the impounded quantity of water. The dam recorded an inflow of 25,478 cusecs. The dam has 76.5 tmcft of water or 72% of the full reservoir level.\nOfficials are not impounding water in the Hipparagi barrage. The dam recorded an inflow of 50,460 cusecs and an outflow of 49,810 cusecs. As inflow is high in the Krishna, the river is in a free flow state, hence storage is not done in the monsoon period, officers said in a release.\nThe Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir on the Krishna at Almatti recorded an inflow of 42,577 cusecs and an outflow of 25,000 cusecs.\nThe dam has 97.13 tmcft of water or 78.92% of the full reservoir level.\nThe Narayanpur dam recorded an inflow of 25,000 cusecs and an outflow of 3,000 cusecs. The dam has 30 tmcft of water or 90% of the full capacity."

Besides there would be biannual review meetings, annual reports, and a real-time data dashboard and the field sites will be spread across over 15 forest divisions and protected areas in southern Karnataka.\n“Modern technology will be used to protect elephant corridors and habitats in order to control the increasing elephant-human conflict in the State and protect the crops of farmers on the edge of the forest areas,” said Environment Minister Eshwar Khandre.\nHe further said that elephant-human conflict is common in Hassan and Kodagu, causing loss of life and crop damage, and the department is taking all possible steps to control it."

    "content": "To tap into the expertise of retired scientists, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) — the newly constituted body for funding scientific research — has announced the Prime Minister Professorships.\nEach selected Professor will receive an annual fellowship of ₹30 lakh, along with ₹24 lakh as a research grant for consumables, domestic travel, contingencies, equipment and other expenses. An overhead of ₹1 lakh per annum has also been provisioned.\nThe Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), now subsumed under the ANRF, had earlier administered the SERB Distinguished Fellowship for retired scientists. That scheme offered a research grant of ₹20 lakh per annum and a monthly fellowship of ₹60,000.\nUnlike previous fellowships, the new initiative is also open to overseas scientists, including Non-Resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin, and Overseas Citizens of India. Additionally, professionals from industry and experienced Professors of Practice with a “distinguished record” of research and innovation are eligible to apply.\nA key distinction of the new programme is that recipients must be based at State universities that qualify as “spoke” institutions under Category A of the recently introduced Promoting Advanced and Inclusive Research (PAIR) programme of the ANRF.\nThe PAIR initiative links universities with nascent research ecosystems to top-tier institutions in a mentorship arrangement. Select Central Universities, National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been classified as “spoke” institutions, while institutions ranked 25 or below in the National Institutional Ranking Framework are designated as “hubs”.\nThe selected Professors are expected to relocate, if necessary, to the host university and provide “sustained academic and research support to faculty and students in institutions with emerging research capacity”.\n“Applicants with strong research credentials must be actively involved in research and innovation activities, and demonstrate a strong commitment to mentor faculty at the eligible State universities where research and innovation is still at a nascent stage,” stated a note from the ANRF announcing the fellowship."

    "content": "ThePahalgam terrorist attackof April 22 was carried out to hurt theJammu and Kashmireconomy and to “sow a religious divide”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (SCO-CFM) meeting in China, where other SCO Ministers — including Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar — were present, and called for support to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nOn Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Jaishankar and the other SCO Ministers from Russia, Iran, Belarus and Central Asian states called on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) before proceeding to the SCO meeting in Tianjin by train. The External Affairs Minister also held bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, both of whom he met earlier this month at the BRICS summit in Brazil.\nMr. Jaishankar’s comments came a month after the SCO Defence Ministers’ meeting failed to issue a joint statement following differences over the references to terrorism. While no statement was issued after the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting as well, officials said it was not the practice to do so, as the Foreign Ministers were normally tasked with finalising the agenda for the Summit of leaders on August 31-September 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Tianjin for the summit, which would be his first such visit since the Galwan clashes in 2020.\n“The three evils that SCO was founded to combat were terrorism, separatism and extremism,” Mr. Jaishankar said during his speech at the meeting, where he referred to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 men, mostly tourists, were religiously identified and killed. “It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide”, he added, calling for the SCO to take an “uncompromising position” on the challenge of terrorism, and referring to the UN Security Council resolution issued in April about the attack.\nA press statement issued by the SCO Secretariat said that the members “exchanged views on key areas of SCO cooperation, including political, economic, trade, cultural issues and key international and regional issues”, but did not specifically mention terrorism.\nMr. Jaishankar’s meeting with Mr. Xi came a day after he held bilateral talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he hailed the “continued normalisation” of India-China relations. The Minister said that he had apprised President Xi of recent developments in bilateral relations. “I value the guidance of our leaders in that regard”, he posted on X, referring to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi.\nChinese state media reported that Mr. Xi had told SCO Ministers that the organisation must play a “more proactive role” to ensure stability in a “turbulent and changing international landscape”. Most SCO countries, especially China and India, would be affected if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned law imposing 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil and sanctioned products.\nIn his comments during the SCO-CFM, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mr. Dar did not refer to the issue of terrorism. In a post on social media, Mr. Dar said that he “underscored the importance of upholding international law and implementing relevant UNSC resolutions to resolve longstanding disputes”, at the meeting and that Pakistan sought peace with “all its neighbours”.\nReferring to Afghanistan, which is an SCO observer state but has not been invited since 2021 when the Taliban regime took control of Kabul, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “compulsions of regional stability are buttressed by [India’s] longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people” and called for SCO members to increase development assistance.\nTaking a swipe at Pakistan for closing transit for India-Afghanistan trade, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “lack of assured transit within the SCO space…undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas”, and advocated for the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that runs through Iran."

Usha Raja Nanthini, Professor and Head, Biotechnology Department, has filed 150 separate applications under industrial design for jewellery made with naturally-occurring seeds. The project, funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), aims to train the tribespeople in jewellery-making and help them market their products through a website.\nFive tribal women have come together to establish a company, Tulir, and registered it as a micro, small and medium enterprise. The website is being designed and will sell honey, nutmeg, lichens, benzoin resin (sambrani), and myrobalan (kadukkai), besides jewellery.\nMs. Usha said, “They live in 15-20 hamlets spread over Palani Hills and their population according to the 2011 Census was around 6,000. The children rarely go to school and they live a simple life collecting non-timber forest produce.”\nWhile being on a project to analyse different species of eucalyptus for anti-fungal properties, Ms. Usha and her team came across this habitation. Seeds of eucalyptus, adenanthera, coix and corymbia found in the area were colourful and tough, and they came in various sizes and shapes. “An idea sparked: if we designed jewellery and taught them how to make them, they could sell the products for a living.”\nA few prototypes of the jewellery designs were submitted to the TNSCST in August 2023 and the Council approved the project in January 2024. Then began the tough task of bringing the villagers together. “They were shy and would not entertain outsiders. So, we went through the tribal headman who helped us getting a few people,” Ms. Usha elaborated.\nThe training for the villagers began in January, and she filed the IPR applications through the IPR cell set up by the Council at the university in March. “The idea of setting up these cells is to protect our intellectual property and use them for the benefit of the people,” said S. Vincent, Member Secretary, TNSCST. The council has already set up 40 such cells.\nFifty villagers from Pethuparai Bharathi Annanagar and Pallangi-Kombai hamlets have been trained in jewellery-making, Ms. Usha said. As an aside, members of a women’s self help group from Vadakounji and Vadajaraparai were trained in apiculture (beekeeping), in collaboration with sisters from Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI).\nThe people living in these hamlets largely belonged to the Pazhiyar and Puliyar tribes and have been eking out a living, collecting lichens, soap nuts, gooseberry, honey and other non-timber forest produce and selling them to intermediaries for a pittance, Ms. Usha said. “The place is so remote that the nearest bus stop is 29 kilometres away. Very few have studied till high school,” she added."

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said. The SIR should not be about verifying citizenship, which is the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.\nThe SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar showed the poll panel had admitted to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party, had been saying — that there was a problem with the electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.\n“If Rahul Gandhi is right, then the ECI should give the Congress the data it has been asking for. First, they should accept this, and then adopt the right method to rectify it,” he said.\n“If they have to revise, it should be done with transparency and given proper time. What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

Bindu calling for discussions on marks  processes and development of tools for the same.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the KHSTU said decisions taken without any discussions on such grave issues as normalisation had led to change in candidates’ ranks, putting students under immense stress and resulting in setbacks in courts. This created wrong precedent and allowed mistakes to continue, the association alleged.\nThe government should organise discussions and deliberation instead of taking unilateral decisions so that apprehensions of State higher secondary students’ who were unfairly disadvantaged could be addressed."

After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\nAlso Read |IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw showcases new Aadhaar app for instant authentication\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

He made the appeal during a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday, as part of his two-day visit to the national capital.\nMr. Naidu was accompanied by Union Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, Minister of State for Rural Development Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, TDP Lok Sabha floor leader Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and others.\nThe Chief Minister explained that the project aims to divert 200 tmc ft of surplus floodwaters from the Polavaram reservoir to the Banakacherla regulator in Kurnool district. This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema. Later, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Managing Director Vikas Kumar also called on the Chief Minister and held discussions on possible collaboration for metro rail projects in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada."

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

The belief that these cases are occurring only in Hassan is incorrect.”\nInstead of panicking, people should focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, getting adequate sleep, and exercising regularly. “Only those having symptoms of heart-related illness should go for a medical check-up. Do not rush to hospitals without a reason,” Dr. Patil said.\nThe Minister further noted that lifestyle changes after COVID-19 have led to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. “Dietary habits have changed, and stress levels have increased. We are studying the reasons behind the rise in deaths among the youth,” he said."

    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”\nSome auto aggregators have already started displaying the revised minimum fare of ₹36. A leading aggregator has adopted the new fare even before its official implementation on August 1."

Yet, Mr. Vikramarka had made ‘false statements’ which are ‘defamatory in nature’ with a ‘preconceived motive to tarnish the fame and reputation’ of the BJP leader, said the notice.\nCondemning the Deputy CM’s statements, the notice said it has caused ‘irreversible’ damage to the Telangana BJP president’s reputation.

Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

A look at such symbols with the size in which they are displayed on ballot papers/EVM machines clearly show the similarities of the free symbols with the BRS symbol of car.\nIt could be clearly understood as to how candidates getting those symbols had been cutting into BRS votes in the past, affecting the prospects of BRS candidates.

To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933.

Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered.

We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre-matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

    "content": "The police have arrested four people, including three habitual offenders from Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly making a ransom call to a city businessman posing as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi last week.\nThe suspects have been identified as Rafiq, a Bengaluru businessman, and Amith, Vansh Sachdev, and Sheeshpal Singh, alias Monty, all from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.\nOn July 8, one of the suspects from U.P. called a Bengaluru businessman claiming to be Bishnoi, and threatened to kidnap his son and demanded ₹1 crore. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

    "content": "After a brief hiatus, the southwest monsoon conditions have strengthened across the State with the intensification of monsoon flow of wind from the Arabian Sea. North and central Kerala will have some intense spells of rain compared to the rest of State for the next week, with spillover rain even benefitting parts of south Kerala.\nThe peak monsoon feature offshore trough, which was in a feeble condition, has now turned into active mode with the trough extending from the Gujarat coast to the south Kerala coast on Tuesday. The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe current spell is likely to bridge the shortfall of July rain over the State, with the north half of Kerala having the lion’s share of rain, including parts of central Kerala. However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

Ramchander Rao for his remarks on the inclusion of Muslims in the Backward Classes (BC) category in the State. He claimed that poor Muslims were first included in the BC category during the British period, adding that Muslims were part of the BCs even in BJP-ruled states.\nSpeaking to the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Tuesday, the Congress MP advised Mr. Ramchander Rao to gain subject knowledge before making such comments. “Ramchander Rao lacks substance, that’s why he is resorting to babbling. It would be better if he gained knowledge on the subject before commenting,” he said.\nMr. Kiran Kumar also alleged that the BJP was attempting to divide people along religious and caste lines. “I hope that at least Ramchander Rao should not do the same thing,” he said, appealing to the BJP for cooperation in the State’s development. He reiterated the Congress government’s commitment to implementing 42% reservations for BCs."

Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment. Later that day, he took the drastic step.\nRamakanth was shifted to a private hospital in Bahadurpally, where he was declared dead.

Anil Kumar from using his official vehicle on Tuesday.\nDr. Kunnummal has issued instructions to Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen, who has been given additional charge of Registrar, and the security wing to implement the order. However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

However, he was informed only a couple of days before the event. By then, his visit to Indi in Vijayapura was already scheduled.\n“The BJP leaders thought that the Chief Minister would speak about the tax collection and the dues from the Centre. To avoid embarrassment, they did not invite him in advance. MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi planned and executed the programme,” he remarked.\nHe maintained that the State government had been taking up many development works for the State, including the Sharavati Pumped Storage project. “It intends to generate 2,000 MW of power. The Central government has also given its consent for the project, which is being executed at a cost of ₹8,644 crore,” he said.\nRegarding the opposition to the project, Mr. Krishna said that the opposition from environmentalists was expected. However, the project would not disturb the local habitats to a large extent. A few families, which would be affected, had been convinced. The government would consider their demands, including jobs, with the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, he added."

    "content": "The rulingNational Conference (NC)on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) upped the ante against Jammu and Kashmir Governor Manoj Sinha, with Chief MinisterOmar Abdullahsaying he “suffered silently for the past eight months”.\n“We suffered in silence for the past eight months but did not complain. It’s for what happened yesterday that you (people) came to know about our reality. But don’t misconstrue our decency for weakness. We don’t talk loudly, threaten or resort togundagardi(hooliganism) but that does not mean we are weak. My strength is my people. I will always safeguard my strength,” Mr. Abdullah, who was addressing a function at the Jhelum Valley Medical College in Srinagar, said.\nMr. Abdullah was referring to the L-G administration’s security measures to stop the Chief Minister and the Ministers from visiting the graveyard where 22 civilians, killed during the 1931 uprising against the Dogra ruler, are buried. On July 14, there were dramatic images where Mr. Abdullah was seen climbing a wall to reach the graveyard and a police officer pushing him in a bid to stop him from paying tributes.\n“They (administration) tried their best to raise barricades on July 14. No barricade will push us away from our goal. We will work towards realising the dignity and dreams of people of Kashmir. There will be no sell out with the dreams of our people. It’s no favour we are ruling Jammu and Kashmir. It’s because of Allah and our people we are here today,” Mr. Abdullah said.\nIt’s for the first time since Mr. Abdullah won elections in October 2024 after a prolonged Central rule that he upped the ante to this high pitch against L-G Mr. Sinha, who retains the powers to transfer employees, both State and Central services, and spearhead the security forces in the union territory.\nThe dramatic images of Mr. Abdullah being heckled and disallowed to reach the graveyard in Srinagar evoked sharp reactions from national leaders, includingTamil NaduChief Minister M.K. Stalin,West BengalChief Minister Mamata Banerjee,Samajwadi Partypresident Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav.\n“At a time when there is a growing demand for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood, the current events unfolding there are a grim reminder of how far things have deteriorated. If this can happen in Kashmir, it can happen anywhere, to any elected representative of the people. Every democratic voice must unequivocally condemn this,” Mr. Stalin said in a post on X.\nMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) described the actions against the sitting Chief Minister as “an insult to democracy”.\n“This land saw countless sacrifices for freedom and the Constitution. Under the same Constitution, Mr. Abdullah’s government was elected by the people. Any insult to Mr. Abdullah is an insult to democracy, an insult to India’s democracy, and an insult to the people who gave us their mandate,” said Mr. Choudhary.\nMr. Choudhary said any insult or humiliation of our leader would not be tolerated. “We will not stay silent. What happened yesterday whether people speak up about it or not is an insult to every Indian who cast their vote,” he added.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister said one day the L-G, like taking responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack, might even say that what happened with OmarSahibwas wrong. “The police are under his control and acted unjustly. He (L-G) owes an apology for what happened yesterday,” he added.\nReferring to Mr. Sinha’s recent statement accepting responsibility for the security lapse in the Pahalgam terror attack, Mr. Abdullah said, “Someone has to be held responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack and now that the security lapses have been accepted.”"

    "content": "A sense of fear gripped Shalivahana Nagar, a residential colony in Malakpet here after gunfire shattered the early morning calm on Tuesday. The incident was reported around 7:20 a.m., just outside Shalivahana Nagar Park, where Communist Party of India (CPI) State Council member Chandu Naik, 47, was shot dead during morning walk.\nThe park, located at the end of a wide lane flanked by swanky independent houses and residential complexes, akiranastore, an Urban Primary Health Centre and many trees, turned into a scene of panic as the attackers allegedly fired five rounds at Naik from close range before fleeing in a car.\nOutside the park’s ‘West Gate’, police from the South East Zone cordoned off an area roughly the size of a human body, with a white chalk outlining the boundaries of the body. At its centre lay a large bloodstain.\nVijay Kumar (name changed on request), a local resident whose house faces the park, said: “I heard what sounded like firecrackers. I rushed out immediately and saw four men escaping in a white car after shooting Naik multiple times. They stood over him briefly to confirm he was dead, then drove away via the four-way junction to the left of the park.”\nThe road in front of the park, to Kumar’s residence, is wide enough for three SUVs to pass at a time. It was the same stretch the assailants used to speed away in their getaway vehicle, a hatchback, that they had rented from a nearby place.\nChandu Naik.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Arrangement\nKumar’s two children, aged 12 and 13, were coming downstairs to leave for school when the shots rang out. “They were terrified and ran back inside. It took some time to calm them down. I eventually had to escort them to their school van myself,” he added.\nHe also pointed out that Naik’s body remained at the spot for over half an hour before the police arrived. Despite the Urban Primary Health Centre being just a few steps away, the body was not moved.\nAnother resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “At first, we thought it was just kids shooting videos in the park again. But the gunshots continued. Minutes later, we saw a body in a pool of blood.” Like many others in the locality, he expressed concern for his safety and said he no longer felt secure taking his morning walk.\nAnil (name changed), who owns a kirana store about 100 metres from the site, said he opened his shop shortly after the attack. “People kept coming in, asking what the sounds were and what had happened. The whole area was in a state of shock,” he said.\nPolice officers at the crime scene.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                NAGARA GOPAL\nBy mid-morning, the lane was swarming with police patrol vehicles, and officers clad in khaki moved briskly across the colony, speaking to residents and scouring the area for clues. The park, which bustles with activity until 10 a.m., was deserted. Access was blocked as police launched an investigation into the shooting.\nMalakpet ACP K.Subba Rami Reddy stated that Naik had been accompanied to the park by his wife and daughter, who had left shortly before the attack. “Around 7.20 a.m., as Naik was walking back towards his car, four men got out of another vehicle and attacked him. One threw chilli powder into his eyes while the others shot him from point-blank range using a country-made pistol,” Mr.Reddy said."

Some ₹3.08 crore was sanctioned to the Karnataka Gramin Bank to develop connectivity infrastructure in underserved areas.\nNABARD released a booklet titled ‘Success Stories of FPOs in Karnataka’, which documented the inspiring journeys of farmer-producer organisations across the State. The booklet showcases how small and marginal farmers have successfully come together to access markets, add value to their produce, embrace digital platforms, and establish inclusive and resilient business models.\nNABARD has played a key role in supporting sustainable agriculture, developing secondary agriculture, creating value addition and in the development of rural infrastructure in Karnataka, acknowledged Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, she urged farmers in the State to make full use of NABARD’s schemes and become entrepreneurs.\nElaborating on value addition, the Chief Secretary said, instead of selling mangoes as raw produce, farmers should process them into various products and sell them. Recently, the price of Totapuri mango variety crashed, and if mango farmers set up small processing units in their villages, they would be able to earn income round the year, she said."

    "content": "Opposition leaders in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday came out in support of a teacher from Bareilly, who was booked under Section 353 (2) (making statements containing false information, rumour or alarming news) of the BNS for his poem, parts of which referred to the Kanwar Yatra.\nThe FIR against Rajneesh Gangwar, a teacher at Bareilly’s MGM Inter College, was registered on July 13, based on a complaint by an outfit named Kanwar Seva Samiti.\nThe video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, which recently went viral on social media, contains a portion where he says, “Kanwar leke mat jana, tum gyan ka deep jalana, manavta ke seva karke tum sachche manav ban jaana[Don’t get pots of holy water from the Ganga, light the lamp of knowledge, become a true human by serving humanity].”\nSharing the video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, former U.P. Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X in Hindi, “The greatest religion is that which leads us on the path of humanity.”\nAttacking the ruling BJP, Congress leader Anil Yadav said that while the Constitution promotes scientific thinking, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry among citizens, which Mr. Gangwar was trying to promote through his verse, elements in the State government aim to encourage “superstition and irrationality and suppress voices”.\nMeanwhile, in a purported video on Tuesday, Mr. Gangwar said his poem was meant to educate students, and his intention was not to express negative sentiments about the yatra. “If you listen to the whole poem, it was recited to educate children and tell them about incidents happening related tokanwariyas.”\nHe also dared the police to take action against senior National Democratic Alliance(NDA)leader and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president O.P. Rajbhar over his purported comments from 2021: “No one can become a doctor or an engineer from among thekanwariyas. Kanwar Yatra is meant only for unemployed people.” At the time, Mr. Rajbhar, an MLA from Zahoorabad, was part of the Opposition. He joined the ruling NDA in 2023 and is currently a Minister in the State Cabinet."

It called reports on media and commentary on social media as “hasty”.\n“A preliminary report is merely the means of communication used for the prompt dissemination of data obtained during the early stages of the investigation and only contains factual information and an indication of the progress of the investigation,” the statement added.\nAmid demands from pilot bodies for allowing them observer status during the ongoing probe, IFALPA said it was “committed” to supporting the AAIB."

Appadurai, Head of Department, Department of Dental Surgery, Vellore Medical College Hospital; K. Baby John, Dean, Vinayaka Mission Hospital (Salem); and B. Vijay, principal, RVS Dental College and Hospital (Coimbatore).\nThe inspection was led by Mr. Appadurai and the other two were members of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Council. “The dental clinic has remained closed since it was sealed from May 31 on orders of Tirupattur Collector K. Siva Soundaravalli. Action against the clinic will be taken based on the report of the team,”, V. Gnana Meenakshi, Joint Director of Health Services (JDHS), Tirupattur, toldThe Hindu.\nThe team inspected various sections in the clinic. The hour-long inspection also involved interaction with doctors, nurses, and other staff, who worked in the clinic before its closure. As the team completed the inspection, health authorities closed and sealed the facility.\nHealth officials said that closure of the clinic comes in the wake of a study done jointly by CMC Vellore, ICMR-NIE and Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health, which stated that an unsterile surgical instrument was used to open a saline bottle at the clinic. Reuse of the bottle’s contents had led to at least 10 people contracting neuro melioidosis — a bacterial infection of the brain — which allegedly led to the death of eight patients, who got treated there, the study said."

A magistrate’s court had found them guilty and handed down the sentence on June 18.\nThe convicts also included an unsuccessful Congress candidate in the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election. All of them convicted under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), and 341 (wrongful restraint) of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment each, along with the imposition of fine of ₹3,200 each.\nAmong the convicts, Abhishek Chaudhary contested the 2023 Assembly election as a Congress candidate from Jaipur’s Jhotwara constituency and lost. The other convicts in the case were Rajesh Meena, Ravi Kirad, Wasim Khan, Dron Yadav, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Vidyadhar Meel.\nAdditional Sessions Judge Prem Ratan Ojha accepted the contention of the appellants that they would be deprived of their legal rights if the sentence was not suspended. The court granted relief to the convicts and posted the case for further hearing on August 26.\nThe Assembly membership of both Mr. Bhakar and Mr. Yadav remains unaffected following the sentencing, as a legislator can be disqualified only on being convicted for an offence with a two-year sentence or more, as per Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."

So, there is great potential for innovation, he observed after inaugurating IBM’s Ecosystem Incubation Center (EIC) at Infopark Kochi. The EIC has been conceived as a strategic space designed to accelerate innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration across start-ups, enterprises, and academia, while serving as a hub for early-stage ventures, skill-building, and co-innovation.\nEmphasising the need for a “clear understanding and consultation” ahead of introducing AI in the government’s daily operations, Mr. Rajeeve said its implementation would not compromise on privacy and data security. “This kind of a change will be very beneficial to the people,” he pointed out.\nThe Minister recalled that the government had prepared a draft proposal called ‘Industry 4.0’ for the introduction of AI in the industrial sector. “We will take a decision on this after receiving feedback from the industry,” he added.\nKerala has 16 colleges that have made it to the top 100 colleges in the country. Three universities are in the top 20, the Minister pointed out. Mr. Rajeeve also inaugurated a symposium ‘GenAI and Agentic AI for start-ups, academia, and enterprises’.\nIBM Software senior vice president Dinesh Nirmal said Kerala enjoyed an advantage in the availability of skills and operational excellence. The State’s transport connectivity is “excellent” compared to other places, he said, noting that the incubation centre was started to “fully utilise the excellent IT ecosystem” in Kerala.\n“By collaborating with organisations such as the Kerala Startup Mission, Infopark, Technopark, and the academia, we aim to scale the development of impactful software solutions to solve our clients’ hybrid cloud and AI needs,” he added.\nPrincipal Secretary (Industries) A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, KSIDC Managing Director Mir Mohammed Ali, IBM India vice president Vishal Chahal, Infopark CEO Susanth Kurunthil, and representatives of industry associations attended the event."

Hatred in politics spares no one.

    "content": "Though Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in April that ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) had been restored, there has been no attempt by either party to conceal the apparent contradictions between them.\nAt a press conference held jointly with the AIADMK general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Shah said, “We will fight the elections under the leadership of Edappadiji.” He also added that there would be a “coalition government” in the event of a victory. The AIADMK did not react positively to this announcement. It is not just the AIADMK; even the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has always been averse to the idea of a coalition government in Tamil Nadu.\nIn the 1980 Assembly elections, the DMK-Congress combine failed to capture power. The constituents of the coalition contested an equal number of seats. After a round of wrangling with the DMK, the Congress finally agreed that the then DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate. However, the coalition did not click at the hustings. Instead, the AIADMK, which won only two seats in the Lok Sabha elections earlier that year and subsequently lost power in Tamil Nadu, staged a spectacular comeback in the Assembly polls.\nIn 2001, when the AIADMK contested the Assembly elections from 141 seats — the lowest number it has ever contested — in view of coalition compulsion, political circles discussed whether the party would be able to obtain a simple majority of its own. The AIADMK needed to secure 118 seats in the House of 234. The AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa never favoured the concept of sharing power in the State. However, the party had no reason to worry as it won 132 seats.\nIn 2006, the DMK fell short of a simple majority as it won only 96 seats. Yet, it refused to share power with its allies. Karunanidhi and the then Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, shared such a good rapport that the DMK patriarch managed to form the government without sharing power with the Congress.\nAfter making that comment in April, Mr. Shah reiterated his position in many interviews to the media. However, the AIADMK is clearly not on the same page. Alluding to the Union Minister’s stand, AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan said that the concept of a coalition government would “never ever” find acceptance among the people of the State. Similarly, Mr. Palaniswami, who launched a State-wide tour from July 7 in the run-up to the 2026 Assembly elections, has been asserting that the AIADMK will form the government after gaining a majority on its own. When asked to comment on Mr. Shah’s position, he said he interpreted them as an endorsement of single-party rule in the State. Despite the conflicting views of the two parties, the BJP State president, Nainar Nagendran, and Union Minister of State L. Murugan participated in Mr. Palaniswami’s campaign launch.\nIn one interview, Mr. Shah said that the nominee for the post of Chief Minister would be from the AIADMK; he did not mention Mr. Palaniswami’s name. This did not go unnoticed in the DMK circles. The party sought to corner the AIADMK general secretary and saw Mr. Shah’s statement as a lack of confidence in Mr. Palaniswami’s leadership qualities. Eventually, it was left to Mr. Nagendran to clarify that the AIADMK leader would head the government.\nYet, speculation is rife that the Union Minister may have in mind former Municipal Administration Minister in Coimbatore, S.P. Velumani. About three weeks ago, the AIADMK strongman shared the stage with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior BJP leaders at the birth centenary celebration of the pontiff of Perur Mutt, Shanthalinga Ramasamy Adigalar. He later explained that he attended the event, which he termed as “apolitical”, only as a local legislator. Prior to the announcement on the tie up between the two parties, there were reports of differences of opinion between the AIADMK chief and some of his senior colleagues, including Mr. Velumani.\nAs the debate over the nature of government could spoil the narrative for the Opposition parties, it would be in the interest of the alliance to sort out the issue soon. Having said that, it remains inexplicable that this debate is even raging given that the composition of different alliances has not even been finalised yet."

    "content": "Jiten Gohain is the head of one of 218 families evicted during a drive the authorities in Assam’s Lakhimpur district carried out on July 3 to reclaim 78 acres of Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) land across four locations.\nOn July 8, the district’s Sub-Divisional Land Advisory Committee approved the allotment of 1.5 kathas (4,320 sq. ft) of land each to 21 families evicted, in one of the fastest such exercises. Among them were 12 belonging to the Ahom community, which is seeking Scheduled Tribe status, to which Mr. Gohain belongs.\nDistrict Commissioner Pronab Jit Kakoty said the eviction drive was conducted following “due process”. He said the affected families, which failed to produce land ownership documents, were served notices on June 29.\n“I had a larger plot from where we were evicted, but the government has at least provided some space,” Mr. Gohain said.\nAbul Hasan Sheikh, one of some 200-odd Bengali-speaking Muslim families evicted from Lakhimpur, is not sure if the government would be equally “generous” to provide him an alternative plot. He is originally a resident of western Assam’s South Salmara-Mankachar district along the border with Bangladesh.\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma named him and at least a dozen others from faraway districts – most of them Muslim-majority – to underline the alleged “agenda of demographic invasion by strategically occupying lands in areas dominated by indigenous communities”.\n“An analysis has revealed that the families evicted from Lakhimpur included 76 from Barpeta, 63 from Nagaon, seven from Goalpara, and two from South Salmara-Mankachar. Why should someone from South Salmara go to Lakhimpur instead of going to West Bengal, about 50 km away?” Mr. Sarma told reporters on Tuesday.\nThe Chief Minister said more than 50,000 people have been evicted from “protected areas, wetlands, VGR and PGR (Professional Grazing Land), government khas (land owned by the government that has not been settled) and wasteland, and those belonging tosatras (Vaishnav monasteries) andnamghars (prayer halls)” over the past few weeks.\nAccording to the State’s Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation of 1986, the Land Policy of 1989, and a 2011 Supreme Court judgment mandate protection of government and village common lands. It also cites the violation of the Assam Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act of 2010 as a punishable offence.\nAfter the BJP came to power in Assam in May 2016, the first eviction drive was carried out in three fringe villages of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. Two persons, including a minor girl, were killed during the eviction based on a Gauhati High Court order in September 2016.\n“Most of those evicted are listed as voters in places from where they came. We have asked the authorities from where they were evicted to delete their names from the electoral rolls to eliminate duplicate names,” Mr. Sarma said.\nCiting the case of the 12 Ahom families, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union has demanded rehabilitation for the evicted Muslim families. It claimed many people had lands they were evicted from before these were declared as reserve forests.\nThe Opposition parties have criticised the eviction drive for disproportionately targeting the minority communities. “The Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission should take note of the eviction during the court holidays in Assam to target poor Muslims. The government must first provide adequate rehabilitation and only then undertake eviction,” All India United Democratic Front MLA Rafiqul Islam said.\n“The BJP government has been projecting the evicted people as Bangladeshi. The government provided a compensation package of ₹14.72 crore to 332 families evicted from Kaziranga. People evicted [in 2021] for the Gorukhuti project [Darrang district] were compensated and given land in the Dalgaon area. Why is the government doing so if these people are Bangladeshi?” Congress leader and advocate Aman Wadud said.\nOthers pointed out that the Dhubri district administration has asked 1,400 families displaced from Chapar town, reportedly to make space for a thermal power plant by the Adani Group, to relocate to a sandbar in the middle of the Brahmaputra river.\n“The eviction is being carried out for two reasons. Firstly, they want to clear land for corporate houses. Secondly, evicting minorities paves the way for the politics of polarisation... so that the Hindu voters back the BJP, especially in eastern Assam, where it is facing challenges,” Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi said.\nLurinjyoti Gogoi, the chief of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), said eviction drives are a form of the tried-and-tested ploy of weaponising the “Bangladeshi issue” before the poll.\nThe Assembly poll in Assam is due by May 2026.\n“The Chief Minister claims he is doing everything for the indigenous people. In reality, more tribal families have been evicted than the Muslims. In Karbi Anglong, 20,000 Adivasi, Karbi, and Naga families have been evicted to hand over 18,000 bighas of land to the Reliance Group,” the AJP leader claimed. In Assam, one bigha is equivalent to 14,400 sq. ft.\nHe also cited 9,000 bighas of land “to be handed over to the Adani Group” in Dima Hasao district, 45 bighas “taken away” from the Adivasis for a hotel project near Kaziranga, and 75 bighas for a Patanjali project in the Golaghat district. “It is evident why the government is on a land acquisition spree. Of the 49,000 bighas cleared, only 6,000 bighas were under the occupation of the religious minorities,” the AJP leader said."

    "content": "The history section of the newly introduced Class 8 social science textbook by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for students in the current 2025-26 academic year portrays Mughal rulers, especially Babur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb, as “intellectuals” who also “plundered” the Indian population.\nThe second chapter of the textbook, titled ‘Reshaping India’s Political Map in Theme B - Tapestry of the Past’ includes references from theBaburnama, Babur’s autobiography, and describes him as cultured, intellectually curious, and having a keen appreciation of architecture, poetry, flora, and fauna. The textbook also goes on to say that Babur was a ruthless conqueror, slaughtering populations, enslaving women and children, and taking pride in erecting “towers of skulls” in plundered cities.\nAkbar’s reign is described as a blend of “brutality and tolerance”, and that during the seizure of the Chittor fort, Akbar, then 25 years old, ordered the massacre of 30,000 civilians, and the enslavement of women and children, the new textbook states. Akbar’s message is also quote in the textbook: “We have succeeded in occupying a number of forts and towns belonging to infidels and have established Islam there. With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” The textbook says Akbar leaned towards peace in the later years of his reign.\nThe new textbook also states that Aurangzeb issuedfarmansor edicts to demolish schools and temples. “Temples at Banaras, Mathura, Somnath among many others were destroyed, as well as Jain temples and Sikh gurdwaras,” the new textbook says. It also speaks of the persecution of Sufis and Zoroastrians at the hands of the Mughals.\nBabur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb have not been described in such detail in the older NCERT textbook’s chapter on the Mughals, which appeared in the Class 7 History book (‘Our Pasts II’).\nMichel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science. File\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu\n“Indian history cannot be cannot sanitised and presented as a smooth, happy development throughout. There were bright periods but also dark periods where people suffered, so we have given note on the darker chapters of history, and also given a disclaimer that no one today should be regarded as responsible for whatever happened in the past,” Michel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science, toldThe Hindu.\n“You cannot understand them (the Mughal emperors) unless you go into the complexities of their personalities. Akbar himself admits he was brutal in his younger days. We are not demonising Akbar or Aurangzeb, but we have to show these rulers had their limitations and committed cruel deeds,” Mr. Danino said.\nBecause Part One of the earlier released new Class 7 Social Science textbook in April culminated in the pre-Delhi Sultanate era of the 6th century, there was an element of uncertainty on how the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era would find their place in the newly revamped textbooks. While earlier a Class 7 student would have learnt about the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal history, these sections have now been shifted to the first part of the newly released Class 8 textbooks, available in bookstores mid-July onward.\nThe first part of the new Class 8 Social Science textbook, which has combined History, Geography, Civics, and Economics into one title,Exploring Society: India and Beyond, will serve as a resource for the first six months of the academic year for Class 8, NCERT officials clarified. “Part Two textbooks for both Classes 7 and 8 for Social Science will be released in October later this year. Part Two textbooks are currently under development,” officials said.\nThe new Class 8 textbook also has a section on heroic resistance to the Mughals, including on the Jat peasants who managed to kill a Mughal officer; the Bhil, Gond, Santhal and Koch tribal communities, who fought to protect their territories; and Rani Durgavati of one of the Gond kingdoms, who fought against Akbar’s army. Sections have also been added on the escape of Mewar’s ruler Maharana Pratap, and the resistance of the Ahoms to Aurangzeb’s army in northeastern India."

So there's all kinds of weapons, but we have not discussed in detail yesterday with the president. This is really being worked through now by the Pentagon, by the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, together with the Ukrainians.\""

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to release water from the expanded Phase-1 canal of the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project on July 17, at the Malyala Pumping Station of Nandikotkur mandal in Nandyal district.\nThe expansion of HNSS Phase-1 canal had been completed, increasing its capacity from 2,200 cusecs to 3,850 cusecs, an official press release said here on Tuesday.\nThis canal was expected to facilitate the transfer of water up to the Jeedipalli Reservoir and beyond, with the government targeting the Chittoor and Punganur branch canals by the end of this month.\nThe expansion, taken up at a cost of ₹696 crore, would enable an additional 1,600 cusecs of water to be carried through the canal network. Officials said the project aimed at addressing the drinking water and irrigation needs of Rayalaseema, covering parts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Chittoor, and Kadapa districts.\nWater from the canal would benefit 6 lakh acres and provide drinking water to approximately 33 lakh people once Phase-1 and Phase-2 become fully operational. Under Phase-1, around 2,906 acres in Nandyal, 77,094 acres in Kurnool, and 1.18 lakh acres in Anantapur were set to receive irrigation supply. Phase-2 was projected to serve 2.27 lakh acres in Anantapur, 37,500 acres in Kadapa, and 1.40 lakh acres in Chittoor.\nThe release also mentioned that the government mobilised efforts to complete 216-km of canal works from Malyala to Jeedipalli, and planned to refill local reservoirs like Jeedipalli, Krishnagiri, Pathikonda, and Gajuladinne. The improved canal capacity was expected to allow full utilisation of the project’s 40 tmc ft water allocation this year — reportedly for the first time in over a decade.\nThe Water Resources Department executed the works over a 100-day period beginning in April 2025. The government plans to complete the remaining Phase-2 works by this month-end and supply water to the tail-end ayacut areas in Punganur and Kuppam.\nA total expenditure of ₹3,890 crore had been earmarked for Phases 1 and 2 of the HNSS project, the release added."

It suggested to enforce statutory timelines and penalties for inaction or misconduct by EROs or District Election Officers (DEOs), empower the State election watch committees to function with observer status during roll revision, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to prevent local influence or partisan misuse and appoint a State-level Ombudsman under ECI to handle unresolved political grievances related to the electoral rolls.\nIt has also suggested the ECI to conduct targeted re-enrollment campaigns for migrant workers, tribal groups, elderly people, and homeless citizens, and permit temporary address declarations with basic documentation to prevent disenfranchisement of mobile populations."

Bystanders who came to her aid were also beaten. Among the suspects is said to be a history-sheeter who runs two liquor bars in the area, is named in a murder case, and has often been accused of encroachment.\nThe PCI has urged the State government and local authorities to ensure that action is taken against the assailants."

He said the government had drafted officials of various departments to receive petitions when only a few months were left for the election. The scheme was aimed at deceiving the electorate into voting for the ruling DMK. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had been concerned only about his family since he entered office in 2021 and launched the scheme now. “Why didn’t he reach out to the people for so long,” he asked.\nUngaludan Stalinwas similar to the exercise undertaken by Mr. Stalin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the run-up to the 2021 election. What was the need for launching a similar exercise when he and his party men had already received petitions. It was nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the people, Mr. Palaniswami said. Furthermore, the initiative was nothing new. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had drafted all revenue officials to receive petitions from the people at their doorsteps. It had been copied and launched as a new scheme to get publicity, he said.\nMr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK government had failed in maintaining law and order. There was no safety for the people. Murders, murders for gain, dacoity, and crimes against women and children were the order of the day. Since the DMK assumed office in 2021, the State had witnessed more than 7,700 murders. Mineral wealth was being looted by the government. A farmer was murdered and another sustained grievous injuries in an assault by the sand mafia in the Manmangalam taluk of Karur district on July 13, he alleged, urging the people to vote out the DMK.\nEarlier, interacting with farmers and representatives of farmers’ associations in Ariyalur district, he said the AIADMK government had provided three-phase power supply to the farmers throughout the day. However, it was stopped by the DMK government. The DMK government had discontinued several other schemes meant for helping the farmers improve productivity. The AIADMK government had provided subsidies to the farmers to buy modern agricultural machines. To prevent malpractices, applications were received online for the selection of beneficiaries. This practice had been halted and only hand-picked farmers were being given the benefits. All the schemes introduced by the AIADMK government for the benefit of farmers would be revived once the party returned to power, he said."
