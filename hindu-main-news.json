    "content": "Traffic jams have become a daily occurrence on the Masab Tank flyover due to the ongoing repair and restoration works. During peak hours, the stream of vehicles could be seen stuck from the flyover up to the PVNR Expressway staring at Mehdipatnam.\nBesides, commuters, who have no inkling of the works, are horrified at the bumpy rides and loud noise while travelling on the flyover.\nThe Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has chosen to carry out the repair works during night in order not to disturb the traffic flow during the day.\nAs per information gathered from the Engineering wing officials, the repairs have been taken up to replace the strip seal joints, in order to arrest water leakage, and damage of the road at joints.\nWork for repairs and restoration of age old flyovers in the city is being taken up by GHMC for some time. Already, the flyovers at Lalapet and Jamia Osmania railway station had been restored, after prolonged repair works which took well over six months. In both cases, traffic was completely stopped on the side of the road where repairs were being taken up.\nHowever, in case of the Masab Tank flyover, it was not possible, officials said, because even with the flyover in place, the traffic crawls irrespective of the time of the day. Without the flyover, it would be mayhem.\n“Repairs are being carried out  at night, while the portion under repair is covered up using iron sheets during the day time to facilitate traffic,” an official shared.\nTenders for the strip seal joint restoration were called during January-February this year, and reportedly finalised with an estimated cost of ₹48 lakh.\nMasab Tank flyover is 24 years old, and one among the first generation flyovers in the city along with the ones built at Narayanguda, Basheerbagh, and Tarnaka.\nWhile the average running age of a flyover is around 30-40 years, this structure has started crumbling even before it could complete 25 years, forcing the authorities to expedite the repair works. In comparison, for Khairatabad flyover, which was built in 1986, no repair works have been taken up so far despite vehicles experiencing bumpy rides.\nMaintenance wing officials have issued an internal circular with instructions for review of all the old flyovers in the city to assess the structural stability, and take up repair works wherever the intended load carrying capacity was not matching.\nOfficials said twenty-four flyovers have been chosen for the assessment, which include those at Khairatabad, Basheerbagh, Narayanguda, Secunderabad, Punjagutta, Begumpet, Tarnaka, Fatehnagar, Nalgonda Crossroads, Moosapet, Seetaphalmandi, Greenlands, Secretariat, and others.\nInspections need to be conducted, and based on the reports, maintenance operations may be taken up such as replacement of expansion joints and distressed bearings, treatment of damaged girders and cracked sections, grouting, RCC repairs, and application of anti-carbonation paint to protect exposed surfaces."

The first phase will be wrapped up in Chengalpattu on August 23.\nSources in the party said that former general secretary and party founder Vijayakant, had undertaken a similar tour in 2017 to appraise the actual strength of the party at the grassroots.\n“It has been a while since the leader of the party met the party cadre. Our general secretary will meet the people and the party workers to understand their point of view. The party cadre will feel energised by this tour,” said former MLA and DMDK’s deputy general secretary B. Parthasarathy.\nFurthermore, sources added that the exercise was necessary as it would reveal the extent to which the party’s support base has got eroded and help towards restoring it.\nMs. Premallatha’s decision to meet the party workers and enthuse them was to prepare for the grand public rally planned in Cuddalore on January 9.\nWith DMDK believed to be keeping their options open, Ms. Premallatha has said that they would make their position clear on the alliance in the public rally on January 9, even after the AIADMK allotted a Rajya Sabha seat to it and announced that the alliance between both the parties would continue.\nMs. Premallatha’s son V. Vijaya Prabhakaran, who has been promoted as the young face of the party recently and appointed as Youth Wing Secretary, is also expected to accompany her in the tour after narrowly losing the Virudhunagar Parliamentary constituency in 2024 Lok Sabha election."

    "content": "Congress-led opposition parties have called for an Odisha bandh on July 17, as grief and outrage poured in from all quarters overthe death of a girlwho had set herself on fire after her complaint against a teacher accused of harassment was ignored on the campus of FM Autonomous College in Balasore.\nTaking to social media platform ‘X’ early on Tuesday, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the death of a daughter seeking justice in Odisha amounts to murder by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led system and this courageous student spoke out against sexual harassment, but instead of receiving justice, she was met with threats, harassment, and relentless humiliation.\n“Those who were supposed to protect her were the ones who broke her spirit. As always, the BJP system shielded the accused — and pushed an innocent girl to the point where she set herself on fire. This is not suicide; it is a murder orchestrated by the system,” Mr. Gandhi said.\nHe questioned ‘silence’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying whether it was Odisha or Manipur — daughters of the country were burning, breaking down, and dying.  “The country doesn’t need your silence — it needs answers. India’s daughters need protection and justice,” said Mr. Gandhi in a hard-hitting message.\nFormer Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in similar line saying, “it is even more disturbing to think how a failed system can take someone’s life. The most painful part is that this was not an accident, but rather the result of a system that remained silent instead of helping. Struggling for justice, the girl ultimately closed her eyes.”\n“With great courage, she had written to the college principal, informing them about the sexual harassment she had faced. Even after being ignored by the college authorities, she did not give up. To seek justice, she reached out to the Higher Education Minister, the Chief Minister’s office, and even a Union Minister. She also personally met the Balasore MP to share her plight,” elaborated Mr. Patnaik.\nStating that if even one person had taken responsibility and intervened personally, he pointed out perhaps the girl’s life could have been saved.\n“She did not lose her life solely due to physical trauma but also because of the negligence of the State government, which left her alone in her struggle. The entire sequence of events reveals that this is nothing less than institutional betrayal—a planned injustice,” said the veteran leader.\nOdisha Governor Hari Babu Kambhampati said he was shattered to learn of the untimely loss of a young student from Fakir Mohan Autonomous College.\n“Her passing is not just a tragedy—it is a stark reminder of the urgent need to safeguard our campuses. The law will take its toughest course. Those responsible will face uncompromising punishment,” he said.\nOdisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi said despite the government fulfilling all responsibilities and the relentless efforts of the team of specialist doctors, her life could not be saved.\n“I assure the family of the deceased student that all those guilty in this case will face the stringent punishment as per the law,” Mr. Majhi said.\nEarlier, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee President Bhakta Charan Das along with leaders of Left parties held a press conference and expressed their deep anguish over the death of the girl.\n“We have called for an Odisha bandh on July 17 demanding judicial inquiry and safety of women,” said Suresh Panigrahi, State Secretary of CPI (M).\nMeanwhile, last rites of the girl who succumbed to burn injuries hours afterPresident Droupadi Murmu visited herat AIIMS Bhubaneswar on Monday evening were performed in Bhogarai area of Balasore district. Mr. Murmu was in AIIMS, Bhubaneswar to address the 5thconvocation ceremony of the institute.\n(Those in distress or having suicidal thoughts are encouraged to seek help and counselling by calling the helpline numbers here)"

    "content": "A Division Bench of the Madras High Court has stayed the operation of an order passed by a single judge directing the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai, to reinstate a former employee with back wages. The Bench has also decided to examine in detail as to whether diplomatic missions would fall under the definition of the term ‘industry’ under the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947.\nThe Bench comprising Justices R. Subramanian and K. Surender granted the interim stay after the Deputy High Commission preferred a writ appeal, through its counsel G. Kalyan Jhabak, and contended that the single judge had overlooked the proposition that an Embassy or High Commission could not be termed as an ‘industry’ as it had been defined under Section 2(j) of the I.D. Act.\nThe orders had been passed on a writ petition filed by T. Senthilkumari, who had served as Consular Assistant at the Deputy High Commission of Sri Lanka in Chennai between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Deputy High Court Commission also argued that there was no master-servant relationship between it and the writ petitioner who had sought reinstatement in service and hence the question of reinstatement would not arise at all. Claiming that the petitioner was not terminated at all, the appellant stated that she had worked only in a temporary post and her contractual service had come to an end on December 31, 2018.\nOn the other hand, the single judge, in his February 12 order, had held that foreign diplomatic missions in India could not claim any exemption from following the labour and social security laws of the country, at least with respect to Indians employed in their High Commissions and Consulates here.\nHe stated that the Parliament had enacted the Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, to give a force of law to a convention adopted by India at the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities held in Vienna on April 14, 1961. Article 33 of the Convention clearly states that only foreign nationals serving in a diplomatic mission would be exempt from the social security laws of the receiving State.\n“Therefore, the exemption provided for in the Article is not applicable to the nationals of the receiving State... In respect of such employees to whom the exemption provided in the Article does not apply, the diplomatic agents shall observe obligations which the social security provisions of the receiving State impose upon employers. In such view of the matter, no immunity can be claimed by the management,” the judge had said.\nHe had further held that Indians serving in foreign diplomatic missions here need not obtain the Centre’s permission, under Section 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure, before approaching an industrial tribunal against their employers. Relying upon a 1963 Supreme Court verdict, he had said, industrial tribunals could not be deemed to be a court for the purpose of obtaining the Centre’s express permission before suing a diplomatic mission."

Even then, the government had decided to shelve the land acquisition process in the interest of farmers who were keen that their land should not be acquired, he said.\nThe farmers of Devanahalli taluk were protesting for the last 1,198 days in Channarayapatna demanding withdrawal of the land acquisition process. Pointing out that their land is fertile, and they are earning remunerative prices for their crops due to proximity to markets in Bengaluru, they had questioned the logic of acquiring fertile land for industrial development.\nTheir protest had become a broad-based one with various progressive organisations lending their support, and warning the government of launching a statewide protest if their demands were ignored. In response, the Chief Minister met their representatives in the first week of July and sought some time to examine the legal issues involved. The final meeting (to decide on the issue) took place on July 15."

    "content": "The detention of Bengali-speaking migrant labourers in BJP-ruled states and their profiling as suspected Bangladeshis has ignited a fresh political firestorm in West Bengal, with the ruling TMC reigniting its Bengali identity pitch that had blunted the BJP’s Hindutva juggernaut in the 2021 Assembly polls.\nWith months to go for the 2026 Assembly polls, what began as isolated complaints of harassment of migrant workers has now evolved into a full-blown political flashpoint.\nThe Mamata Banerjee-led TMC is going all guns blazing to turn what was once a socio-economic crisis into an emotive electoral issue, accusing BJP governments in Odisha, Assam, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Gujarat of “institutional and linguistic profiling” and “criminalisation of poverty” under guise of national security.\nFrom branding the crackdown as a “humiliation of Bengalis” to planning massive protest rallies in Kolkata, including a July 16 march to be led by Banerjee herself, the TMC is rekindling the sub-nationalist fervour it used to great effect in 2021 through the slogan ‘Bangla Nijer Meyeke Chaye’ (Bengal wants its own daughter).\nThe flashpoint first emerged in June, when at least seven Bengali-speaking people were pushed back to Bangladesh from Maharashtra and other states, allegedly without proper citizenship verification or intimation to the West Bengal government. They were later repatriated through legal and diplomatic intervention after their Indian citizenship was confirmed.\nLast week, Odisha Police detained 444 workers from various Bengal districts on suspicion of being illegal immigrants, though 50 were later released after submitting documents.\nIn Delhi, electricity and water supply were snapped in Bengali-dominated Jai Hind Colony, following a civil court order amid allegations of power theft, adding further fuel to the fire.\n“There are over 1.5 crore migrant workers in Bengal who live with dignity. But the same cannot be said for BJP-ruled states, where Bengalis are being treated as infiltrators in their own country. Speaking Bengali does not make one Bangladeshi,” said TMC MP Samirul Islam. “Harassment of Bengali workers is proof that this is part of a pattern of hatred towards Bengali-speaking people. Do these migrant labourers now need separate visas to visit BJP-ruled states?” Mr. Islam toldPTI.\nThe Bengal government is now exploring legal options against what it calls the “unconstitutional deportation” of Indian citizens.\nSeizing the moment, the TMC has pivoted its campaign narrative to champion the rights and dignity of Bengali-speaking migrant labourers, an estimated 22.5 lakh of whom work across in construction, brick kilns, factories, and informal sectors across the country.\n“Our people are being treated like infiltrators just because they are poor and speak Bengali,” said senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim.\nTMC minister Manas Bhunia said, “These inhumane acts against Bengali workers reflect BJP’s deep-rooted hatred for Bengalis. People of Bengal will give a befitting reply to this insult in the coming elections.”\nSociologist Supriya Basu called the developments part of an effort to “impose North Indian Hindutva culture on Bengal”. “The BJP is attempting to set up colonies of Uttar Pradesh-style Hindutva in Bengal. Targeting migrants over language is just one manifestation of that push,” she said.\n“The large migrant population could have been an administrative liability, highlighting Bengal’s job crisis. But BJP’s aggressive profiling has flipped the narrative in TMC’s favour,” she added. The BJP has countered TMC’s allegations by citing national security and illegal immigration concerns.\nBJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya claimed over 300 of the 444 detained in Odisha had “fake or unverifiable” documents.\nNewly appointed Bengal BJP chief Samik Bhattacharya went a step further, alleging a deliberate TMC-backed infiltration plan. “These people work in other states and return to Bengal to vote for Mamata Banerjee. This is a demographic and national security threat,” he said.\n“Instead of protecting Indian citizens, the TMC is shielding infiltrators and playing the victimhood card,” said BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.\nWhile the Congress and CPI(M) have condemned the harassment and arbitrary arrests, they have carefully distanced themselves from TMC’s more emotive “Bengali vs outsider” pitch.\n“Migrants labour rights are non-negotiable. But TMC’s rhetoric is aimed at deflecting from its own governance failures,” CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said.\nPolitical analyst Suman Bhattacharya summed it up, “In Bengal, pride often trumps policy. Banerjee knows how to tap into that. TMC, which was being cornered on multiple fronts, has now found a potent counter-narrative through this migrant issue.” \tPolitical scientist Maidul Islam predicted this would become a major political flashpoint in 2026 polls.\nAfter its 2021 triumph, the TMC had tried to rebrand itself as a national party with pan-Indian ambitions, toning down the sub-nationalist plank and inducting non-Bengali MPs like Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad, and Yusuf Pathan.\nBut with Assembly polls looming and the Hindutva narrative gaining steam, the party appears to be returning to its strongest emotional card — Bengali pride.\nWhether the next election will replicate the “Bengali versus outsider” wave of 2021 or produce a more fractured verdict depends on how each party can sustain its competing narratives."

    "content": "The internal strife in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra appeared to reverberate in its Kerala unit, a ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) ally, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nThe NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Maharashtra, has demanded the resignation of two NCP-Sharad Chandra Pawar group legislators aligned with the LDF in Kerala for alleged anti-party activities.\nPraful Patel, NCP-Ajit Pawar faction’s national working president and chairman of the party’s central disciplinary committee, has also put Kerala Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran and Kuttanad MLA Thomas K. Thomas on notice for allegedly pursuing an anti-party line in Kerala. He has disqualified them from the NCP’s primary membership for six years.\nMr. Patel noted that both Mr. Thomas and Mr. Saseendran had won under the unified NCP’s clock symbol in the 2021 Assembly elections in Kerala. Subsequently, in 2023, the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognised the NDA-aligned Ajit Pawar faction as the “original” NCP. He accused the legislators of skipping party meetings and working as a parallel political entity far outside the “authentic” NCP’s ambit.\nMr. Patel warned both the Kerala leaders that the NCP-Ajit Pawar would draw them to court for allegedly violating the provisions of the Anti-Defection Law and the People’s Representation Act.\nMr. Thomas toldThe Hinduthat the NCP’s constitution did not envisage a national working president post as claimed by Mr. Patel. Moreover, the two NCP legislators in Kerala were aligned with Mr. Sharad Pawar. “So where is the question of an NCP split in Kerala?” he added.\nMr. Saseendran stated that the Supreme Court order awarding the NCP name to Mr. Ajit Pawar was an interim order. He said he awaited the apex court’s final decision in the dispute over the NCP symbol and original name.\nThe NCP legislators in Kerala had aligned with the Sharad Pawar faction after the party’s split over Mr. Ajit Pawar’s decision to align with the NDA in Maharashtra in 2023.\nSubsequently, Mr. Saseendran and Mr. Thomas filed affidavits in the Supreme Court declaring their allegiance to Mr. Sharad Pawar. They accused Mr. Ajit Pawar of “abandoning NCP’s founding Gandhian and Ambedkarite values” and swore their commitment to the LDF.\nMeanwhile, Kerala’s Leader of the Opposition V.D. Sastheesan said the LDF had “no ethical compunction in embracing two BJP allies” in Kerala, despite the Communist Party of India (Marxist)‘s [CPI(M)] “grandstanding against the Sangh Parivar.”\nHe said the national leadership of the Janata Dal (Secular), which has two legislators, including Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty, was aligned with the BJP and an NDA ally. “The LDF has lost its moral compass”, he added."

    "content": "The prescribed fees for MBBS in self-financing medical colleges under management and NRI quotas has been increased, with the Selection Committee putting out the revised fee structure for the academic year 2025-2026 as per the order of the Committee on Fixation of Fee in respect of self-financing professional colleges, on Monday.\nAs per the order, the fees for government quota in the 21 self-financing medical colleges were ₹4,35,000 to ₹4,50,000. The management quota fee was fixed at ₹15,00,000, while it was ₹27,00,000 for NRI quota.\nIn its order, the committee - Justice R. Pongiappan is the chairman and P. Senthil Kumar (Health Secretary) is member secretary - said that the fee included tuition fee, admission fee, special fee, laboratory/computer/internet fee, library fee, sports fee, maintenance and amenities fee, extracurricular activities fee and other recurring expenditure.\nManickavel Arumugam, education counsellor, gave a comparison of the increase in fee structure. “The good thing is that the government quota fee in self-financing medical colleges remains untouched. The fee for management quota and NRI quota has been increased. From ₹13,50,000, the management quota fee has been increased to  ₹15,00,000, while for NRI quota, the fee has been increased from ₹24,50,000 to ₹27,00,000,” he said.\n“Another positive aspect is that they have completely done away with the NRI lapsed quota category. So, through this, the NRI quota seats that fall vacant will be added to the management quota,” he added.\nFor State private university medical colleges, the committee noted that four institutions in the category were established recently - during 2022 to 2024 - and the fee was fixed during the same period. So, the committee unanimously decided that except the NRI quota, the fee hike for these institutions pertaining to undergraduate and post graduate medical courses is not necessary at present.\nWhile the fee for government quota in these institutions was ₹5,40,000, it was ₹16,20,000 for management quota and ₹30,00,000 for NRI quota. Mr. Arumugam pointed out that NRI fee has increased from ₹29.4 lakh\nThe committee stated that these fees do not include hostel, transport and mess charges that are optional for students. The institutions were directed to submit the details of these fees to the Selection Committee well in advance before the commencement of counselling. It also directed the institutions not to collect or levy any other recurring or non-recurring fee including capitation fee. In case of any deviation from the order, the committee said it will send a recommendation to the respective authority for withdrawal of approval by the National Medical Commission and disaffiliation by the respective university as well as the imposition of fine.\nHowever, healthcare professionals in the know-how said there is a greater need for the Selection Committee to keep an eye on collection of excess fees from students. “Tamil Nadu has one of the highest fee structures for MBBS in private universities in the country. Some institutions also charge students for the fifth year (house surgeoncy). Some fee heads such as hostel fee remain murky and should be closely monitored for excess fee collection,” a source said."

However, a recent report has found that this distribution is not uniform. The distribution is irregular in over 560 schools.\nWith the help of Azim Premji Foundation for Development (APF), steps were taken to provide eggs for six days a week from September 2024.  The APF inspection team inspected about 762 schools across Karnataka, out of which, the School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) in 568 schools were found to have taken improper decisions regarding the distribution of eggs and bananas.\nThey had  decided to distribute eggs to students three days a week and bananas on the remaining three days. In some other schools, it has been decided to distribute bananas instead of eggs on Mondays and Saturdays. Despite obtaining parental consent, it was found that a unilateral decision had been made to distribute bananas instead of eggs to students  six days a week.\nAccording to the report, the highest number of schools where eggs and bananas are being distributed irregularly is in Tumakuru district — 132 .\nThis is followed by Chikkamagaluru district (74 schools), 56 in Bengaluru Rural district, 50 in Kolar district, 37 in Dakshina Kannada, 36 in Raichur, and 21 schools in Shivamogga, the native district of School Education Minister Madhu Bangarappa.\nThe report has been submitted to the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL).\n“It is not right for SDMCs take a decision to distribute eggs in schools on two or three days instead of six days a week, even with the consent of the parents. SDMCs are not allowed to take such decisions on their own ,” said Director of PM Poshan, Shakti Nirman.\nThe Headmaster of the school, the officials concerned are not paying attention to such cases, and such wrong practices have not been corrected so far, which leads to dereliction of duty and neglect of the interests of the programme.\n“As a result, the nutritional support programme will suffer a serious setback. If this continues, the officers concerned will be held responsible and disciplinary action will be taken,” he added."

    "content": "The Yemeni government has frozen the execution of Nimisha Priya, the Malayali nurse awaiting capital punishment for allegedly killing a Yemeni national named Talal Abdo Mahdi. Her execution was earlier scheduled for Wednesday (July 16).\nThe government stayed the execution following the intervention of prominent Yemeni Islamic scholar Habib Omar bin Hafizon the request of influential Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar.\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar, in a Facebook post at 2.20 p.m. on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), said the Yemeni government stayed the execution. He posted the government order in Arabic on his Facebook page.\nKanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar thanked everyone who prayed for Nimisha’s life. He said “God’s grace be on them all.”\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar’s last-minute intervention on Sunday sparked a ray of hope as all other efforts to obtain a reprieve for Nimisha had failed.\nHe made the intervention following an appeal by a few politicians led by Congress leader Chandy Oommen.\nSheikh Habib Omar bin Hafiz, a much-respected scholar who is a member of the Yemen Shura Council and a follower of the Sufi order, entrusted his brother’s son Habib Abdurahman Ali Mashoor to initiate talks with Mahdi’s family.\nMr. Mashoor held several rounds of talks with Mahdi’s brother. Hudaida State court chief justice and Yemen Shura Council member too took part in the discussions on the request of Mr. Hafiz.\nSources close to Mr. Aboobacker Musliar said the murder of Mahdi, which took place in 2017, had made a deep emotional impact not only on the family of the deceased but also among the community at Dhamar in Yemen. “That was the reason why none could influence the family so far,” said one of the aides of Mr. Aboobacker Musliar.\nHe said Mahdi’s family could not reject the request of Mr. Hafiz. “Sheikh Habib Omar wields such respect among the people in Yemen. We are all hopeful that Mahdi’s family will forgive Nimisha Priya,” he said."

However, when a health team visited her residence to escort her to the hospital for institutional delivery, she and her family members could not be traced.\nAlthough the family initially maintained contact with staff at the Government Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Bynapuram, they later switched off their mobile phones, and their whereabouts remain unknown. Relatives and neighbours reportedly gave conflicting statements regarding her location.\nDespite multiple visits and sustained efforts by the health team to assure the family that Shevanthi would only be taken to the Thalavadi Government Upgraded PHC—with full transportation and medical support to ensure the safety of both mother and child — the family refused to cooperate or reveal her whereabouts.\nDuring a follow-up visit on Monday (July 14), Village Health Nurse P. Jothi was told by a family member, “Shevanthi is fine, but we do not know where she is.”\nWith all efforts to trace her proving unsuccessful, the health team lodged a complaint at Thalavadi police station. Officers visited the house and conducted inquiries. Police sources said efforts are underway to trace mobile numbers and gather leads through investigation.\nS. Kannaiyan, president of the Thalavadi Farmers’ Federation, commended the health team’s persistent efforts and said misconceptions surrounding institutional deliveries among tribal communities should be addressed through awareness campaigns in hilly areas."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), while hearing a plea alleging harassment over the feeding of community dogs in Noida, asked the petitioner, \"Why don't you feed them in your own house?\"\nA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta told the petitioner's counsel, \"We should leave every lane, every road open for these large-hearted people? There is all the space for these animals, no space for humans. Why don't you feed them in your own house? Nobody is stopping you.\"\nThe plea related to a March 2025 order of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe petitioner, the counsel said, was subjected to harassment and was unable to feed community dogs in line with the Animal Birth Control Rules.\nRule 20 of the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023 deals with feeding of community animals and puts onus on resident welfare association or apartment owner association or local body's representative of the local area to make necessary arrangements for feeding of community animals residing in the premises or that area.\nThe top court, however, said, \"We give you a suggestion to open a shelter in your own house. Feed every dog in the community in your own house.\"\nThe petitioner's counsel claimed compliance with the rules and said the municipality was creating such places in Greater Noida but not in Noida.\nHe said feeding points could be made at a place not frequented by people.\n\"You go on cycling in the morning?\" the bench asked, \"try doing it and see what happens\".\nWhen the counsel said he goes on morning walks and sees several dogs, the bench said, \"Morning walkers are also at risk. Cycle riders and two-wheelers are at greater risk.\"\nThe bench then tagged the plea with a separate pending plea on a similar issue.\nIn the High Court, the petitioner sought directions to the authorities to implement provisions of the rules with due care and caution keeping in view the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.\n\"While protection of street dogs would be warranted in accordance with the provisions of the applicable statute, at the same time, the authorities will have to bear in mind the concern of common man, such that their movement on streets are not hampered by attacks by these street dogs,\" the High Court said.\nThe High Court, therefore, expected the state authorities to exhibit \"due sensitivity\" to the concerns of the petitioner and the common man on the streets.\nThe High Court said the observation was necessary because there were many instances of attacks by street dogs on people of late, which has resulted in loss of lives and grave inconvenience to pedestrians.\nIt disposed of the plea with a direction to the authorities to ensure that concerns highlighted by the court were duly taken care of and appropriate measures were taken to ensure protection of strays besides ensuring interest of people on the streets was not jeopardised."

Sivankutty on Tuesday said the government will proceed with the revised school timing schedule but that discussions will be held with those opposed to it to explain the rationale and convince them.\nSpeaking to the media at Government guest house here, the Minister made it clear that the discussions are not aimed at reversing the decision.\n“The aim is to engage with the stakeholders and clarify the government’s position, and not to alter the decision,” the Minister said, responding to ongoing protests against the changed school hours.\nThe Minister said “education should not be confused with religion”, asserting that the government’s decisions are guided by the Education Act, not religious considerations.\nHe clarified that the revised school timing was a policy decision made in accordance with the Education Act.\n“Samastha is free to express its opinion and the government is open to discussions,” he said.\nThe Minister added that Samastha leader Sayyid Muhammad Al Jifri had contacted him by phone to discuss concerns regarding the change in the timings and conversation would be held.\nMr. Sivankutty also suggested that Samastha may have been “misinformed” about the government’s intentions. “Someone has misled Samastha on this matter,” he said indicating that misconceptions may have fuelled the opposition.\nThe Minister’s remarks come amid ongoing debates and objections raised by certain religious and community groups over the shift in school hours across the State.\nThe Minister also strongly criticised the recent instances of ‘pada puja’ (foot worship) reportedly conducted in some schools and took a swipe at Governor Rajendra Arlekar over the latter’s perceived endorsement of such practices.\n“The Governor’s inclination towards foot worship is now evident. If such acts are carried out under RSS patronage, the schools cannot function legally,” he said.\nMr. Sivankutty questioned how the Governor could “support” making children wash feet, calling it “unacceptable and inappropriate” in an educational setting.\nHe further accused the Governor of contributing to administrative paralysis in universities, stating that “the current administrative gridlock is the Governor’s doing.”"

Shanmugam has approached the Madras High Court against the action being taken by the State government officials across Tamil Nadu to remove party flagpoles from public places in compliance with adirection issued by a single judge in Januarythis year.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), accepted a request made by advocate R. Thirumoorthy for an early hearing of the writ petition filed by Mr. Shanmugam, who had challenged the Revenue department’s July 10 letter, and directed the High Court Registry to list the plea for hearing on Wednesday.\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner stated a single judge at the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, had on January 27, ordered removal of all flagpoles erected by political parties, religious bodies, caste-based associations and others in all public places including lands belonging to the civic bodies, highways and other public institutions.\nEven with respect to erection of flagpoles on private lands, the judge ordered that it could be done so only with permission and directed the State government to frame rules in that regard. Taking exception to such directions, Mr. Shanmugam said, it was an intolerant idea of democracy to remove flag poles.\nContending the CPI(M) had been the revolutionary vanguard of the working class in the country, the petitioner said, it was important both for the party as well as its affiliated body Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) to remain connected with the masses through the pictorial representations on their flags.\nThe petitioner said a Division Bench comprising Justices G.R. Swaminathan and K. Rajasekar had, on June 26, concurred with his contention that the single judge ought not to have passed such orders without affording an opportunity of hearing to the political parties since it violates the principles of natural justice.\nThe Division Bench had alsoreferred the issue to the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Benchwhich could pronounce an authoritative verdict. In the meantime, the single judge continued to monitor the implementation of his direction and about 19 Collectors reported to have removed 100% of flag poles from public places.\nSince he insisted that the poles must be removed from the rest of the districts too, the Revenue department had written a letter to the Collectors of the remaining 19 districts which included Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi and Coimbatore instructing them to remove all flag poles from public places before July 18.\nStating he came to know about the letter only on July 15, Mr. Shanmugam urged the court to quash it and issue a direction to the government officials to not take any coercive action until the issue gets decided by the larger Bench in view of the reference made by the Division Bench."

He urged the Commission to ensure this democratic momentum continues through timely, inclusive, and tech-driven voter roll revisions.\nKey suggestions include annual third-party audits under the CAG, AI-driven de-duplication, Aadhaar-based EPIC number verification, and enhanced public dashboards for voter grievance tracking. The TDP also called for stricter accountability of election officials, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and special enrolment drives for marginalized and migrant populations.\nReferring to the upcoming Special Intensive Revision (SIR), the party emphasized the need for procedural clarity, safeguards against wrongful deletions, and respect for prior voter inclusion. Stressing that the exercise should not be conflated with citizenship verification, the party asked for early initiation of the SIR in Andhra Pradesh."

The External Affairs Minister is now running a full-blown circus aimed at destroying India’s foreign policy,” Mr. Gandhi said in a X post, tagging a media report that said Mr.Jaishankar met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and apprised him of latest developmentsin bilateral ties.\nEarlier, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh, issued a statement, questioning Mr Jaishankar’s assertion during his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng on July 14.\nNoting that the External Affairs Minister stated that the India-China bilateral relationship “has been steadily improving since the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan last October” and that “continued normalisation of our ties can produce mutually beneficial outcomes,” Mr. Ramesh sought to remind him of China’s recent positioning with regard to India.\nThe Congress leader stressed that it is essential to build a national consensus on the critical security and economic challenges arising from China’s rise as the world’s leading manufacturing power and its position as the second-largest economy.\n“Perhaps we should remind the EAM of recent developments in bilateral ties since the PM’s last tete-a-tete with President Xi: China gave total support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, turning it into a testing ground for network-centric warfare and weapon systems such as the J-10C fighter and PL-15E air-to-air missile and assorted drones,” he said in a statement.\nHe added that Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Rahul R Singh has stated that India fought three adversaries in Sindoor, including China that gave Pakistan “live inputs” i.e. real time intelligence on Indian military operations and soon they are likely to acquire Chinese J-35 stealth fighters in the near future.\nFurther, Mr. Ramesh argued that China has restricted exports to India of critical materials like rare-earth magnets, speciality fertilisers, and tunnel-boring machines for infrastructure projects.\nImportant sectors like telecoms, pharmaceuticals, and electronics remain critically dependent on Chinese imports, while hundreds of Chinese workers have departed from India’s Foxconn facilities, potentially impeding India’s attempt to become an alternative global supplier of Apple smart phones, he added.\n“When are the External Affairs Minister and his boss the PM going to take the people of India into confidence and hold a detailed debate on China in Parliament — as the Indian National Congress has been calling for since 2020. The INC hope that the Prime Minister will finally agree to such a discussion and break the five-year drought in the forthcoming Monsoon session of Parliament,”Mr Ramesh asked.\nAnd in a separate press conference, Congress social media head Supriya Shrinate said while the EAM reaches out to China, who openly backed Pakistan during Ops Sindoor, not a single terrorist involved in the Pahalgam terror attack has been arrested so far."

    "content": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Atal Incubation Centre (AIC) is planning to go ahead with the next stage larger-scale trials of the indigenously developed mRNA vaccine technology for tacklingChikungunya.\n“Chikungunya is a serious, major debilitating disease in India and it does not yet have a vaccine. We have already demonstrated the ability to make use of mRNA technology to develop vaccines with a ‘Proof of Concept’ (PoC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our lab data trials show our Chikungunya vaccine works,” disclosed AIC-CCMB chief executive officer N. Madhusudhana Rao.\nThe lab experiments conducted on animals showed that the vaccine candidate can produce antibodies against Chikungunya proteins. The next phase will be to infect the animals and check if the virus load has decreased upon injecting the developed vaccine, he explained.\nThe CEO said the institute had also completed initial trials into a potential mRNA vaccine to prevent tuberculosis (TB). But, to go into the next stage of animal trials and more elaborate testing, adequate funding is required, for which different options are being explored.\nVaccines work by preparing and training the immune system to identify disease-causing microorganisms and eliminate them quickly when the system encounters them. In mRNA technology, the host cell’s immune system is trained to evade the real infection by introducing mRNA of an important protein of the microorganism of concern into the host, said Mr. Rao.\nInterestingly, though AIC had developed the PoC for mRNA technology in less than a year and had announced the same two years ago, it did not elicit much response from either the Indian industry or foreign collaborators.\n“There were a few firms which evinced interest in making use of ourmRNA technologyfor vaccine research. But they never came back with concrete proposals. It is an accepted fact that firms spend millions to take licenses from abroad rather than spend a few lakhs on local technology,” said Mr. Rao, a former senior scientist of the CSIR-CCMB.\nComirnaty (by Pfizer) or Spikevax (by Moderna) are based on mRNA technology for COVID and found to be extremely effective. The mRNA technology is considered chemically safe with no long-term challenges. The one developed in AIC-CCMB too is based on the existing mRNA vaccine model. It is as safe as the one approved by the US Food & Drug Administration Agency and had undergone a third party quality check, affirmed the CEO.\nmRNA works much better on viruses and vaccines can be developed for other diseases faster. “It is unfortunate that there are few takers for our technology, though many are trying the same through different platforms. But we want to go ahead with our trials for the potential Chikungunya and TB vaccine candidates now with different partners,” added Mr. Rao."

However, it has been stopped by the DMK government, Mr. Palaniswami charged.\nSimilarly, the DMK government had discontinued several schemes aimed at supporting and helping the farmers to improve productivity. The AIADMK government provided 50% subsidy for women farmers and 40% subsidy for the farmers to modernise agricultural equipment, instruments or machines. To prevent malpractices and ensure transparency, applications were received online to select the beneficiaries. The practice had been stopped now, and the benefits were being passed on to hand-picked farmers.\nMr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government had started a Veterinary College and Research Institute at an estimated budget of ₹1,000 crore in Salem. Some infrastructure of the research institute could not be completed due to the change of government in 2021. Despite his repeated questions in the State Assembly, many facilities have not yet been established, the former Chief Minister charged."

    "content": "Russian woman Nina Kutina and her two children,who were rescued by Gokarna Policeand processed by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Bengaluru, were sent to a rescue centre in Tumakuru on July 14, 2025.\nKutina, who had been living with her daughters in a cave near Gokarna, defended her lifestyle and rejected the claims made about her situation.\n“You give already a lot of lying information. We have big experience to stay in natural, in jungle, and we were not dying, and I did not bring my children, my daughters to die in jungle. They did not feel bad, they were very happy, they swam in waterfall, they lived, had very good place for sleeping, a lot of lessons with art making, we made from clay, we painted, we ate good, I was cooking with gas, very good and tasty food,” she said.\nDismissing suggestions of neglect or danger, she added, “They have everything best, they were happy, and dressed, and sleeping good, and art lessons, and lessons about how to write and read, and they were not dying from hunger, never, everything not true. I have a lot of websites like social net, my profile has a lot of video about our life experience, and a lot of years, different country, like near 20 countries I live, different forest, because we love natural.”\nKutina stated that they had been taken to the hospital, but her children were in perfect health. “Today they brought us to hospital for doctors, it was the first time my daughters were in hospital, they are full of health, not one pain they have, and not one time in their life they were sick.”\nShe also defended the cave they were living in, calling it safe and near a village. “Because we love living natural, it’s just one reason, and this cave was not in like in big big forest, far far from all, and we could probably buy food or anything, it’s very close to village, and it’s very big and beautiful cave, and not small, and it’s like it has window to look to ocean.”\n“It’s not a dangerous place, every tourist three minutes can come at place, and snakes for all time we live, yes we saw a few snakes, but same time in grove, Gokarna grove, people put a photo about snakes come to home, to kitchen, to toilet, to everywhere, it’s same same.”\nRegarding visa issues, Kutina admitted their documents had expired but disputed reports that they had overstayed since 2017. “It is lying, because they found my old passport, and they decide what it’s like, they did not check if it’s real true. We don’t have our visa, valid visa, our visa finished, but it was short time ago. After 2017, we already were in four countries, leave and then come back to India.”\nShe also explained her continued stay in India after her son passed away. “After I had my son, big son, he died, died, and because it happened, and it brought what my new visa, I stayed little more, but not so much, how they tell.”\nKutina said she was born in Russia but hadn’t lived there for 15 years. “After that I was travelling a lot of countries, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Bali, Thailand, Nepal, Ukraine.” Rejecting the narrative that spirituality alone motivated her, she clarified, “It is not about spiritually how they write, it’s not about it, we just like natural because it gives us health... it’s very big health, it’s not like you live in home.”\nShe maintained that her daughters were comfortable and happy. “Very comfortable. I have telegram canal where for all time what we stay in cave, we have photo, video, what we do inside, how we cook tasty food, what we eat, how we make lessons, art, painting and clay... all what we do, you can look at.”"

    "content": "The Madras High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) directed the Centre to come up with a simple mechanism through which women could get their private images and videos removed from the internet and digital platforms, if they had been uploaded surreptitiously by unscrupulous elements, without compromising their identity.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh directed central government senior panel counsel A. Kumaraguru to develop a prototype after taking instructions from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) as well as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on appointing a nodal officer for grievance redressal.\nThe directions were issued on a writ petition filed by a woman advocate whose former partner had recorded their private moments without her knowledge and shared them on social media. The petitioner complained the images and videos had landed on several porn sites too thereby causing great amount of agony to her.\nSenior counsel Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam told the judge though MeitY had complied with an interim order passed by him last week to block the websites in which her client’s images and videos had been displayed, those websites had resurfaced again and continued to display the same images and videos.\nStating the problem with the Internet was the presence of technically sound criminals, the judge said, it was not as if there was no technology available to prevent re-surfacing. “The technology is always there but what is required is the inclination to put it to use for the benefit of the common man,” he added.\nThe judge said, the system was so that it would work with its might and remove all traces from the Internet if the victim happened to be a daughter of a Minister of a judge but it does not show the same eagerness and energy if the victims happen to be common citizens with no connections whatsoever with the mighty and powerful.\nJustice Venkatesh said, technology such as tracing photo DNA must be put to best use so that women do not have to suffer silently because of increasing instances of their private images and videos getting shared on public platforms or being subjected to harassment under the threat of releasing those images in public.\nThe judge also rapped the police for having mentioned the name of the woman advocate in the First Information Report (FIR) registered against her former partner on the basis of a complaint lodged by her. He wondered how the police could be so insensitive to disclose her identity in a public document.\nHe directed the police to redact her name from the FIR forthwith and came down heavily on the police department for having made the victim watch the private images and videos along with seven male police personnel, after she lodged the complaint, in order to identify the perpetrator.\n“Don’t you have women police personnel well versed in cyber crime? Can’t you ask those women personnel to deal with such cases? How can you make the victim sit along with seven male police personnel to watch those videos? Does it not amount to violating her right to dignity?” the judge asked.\nStating investigation in offences against women must be done with a lot of sensitivity, the judge insisted on the appearance of State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah on the next hearing so that necessary instructions could be issued to the police department."

Anand Venkatesh, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), directed a central government counsel to take notice on behalf of the RPO and accepted a request made by a Tamil Nadu government advocate to grant time till July 22 for filing a status report on behalf of the Inspector of Neelankarai police station in Chennai.\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner stated that he had been facing motivated criminal cases since 2008 and yet he had been visiting many foreign countries to meet the Tamil diaspora. When the RPO refused to reissue Seeman passport with additional pages in 2013, he had approached the High Court and obtained a favourable order.\nHowever, when he planned to visit some neighbouring countries in September 2024, he learnt to have lost his passport somewhere. Immediately, a police complaint was lodged and a Lost Document Report (LDR) was obtained on October 10, 2024. Thereafter, he applied for reissuance of the passport in November 2024.\nThe RPO on January 31, 2025 refused to reissue the passport, the petitioner complained and contended he was not facing any serious charges and there was no likelihood of him absconding or evading the course of justice. Mere pendency of a few “motivated criminal cases” could not be a reason to deny passport, he said."

The collector instructed officials to integrate sports training into the academic routine, identifying students’ interests early and preparing them to compete at national and international levels. She congratulated students who recently won silver and bronze medals in boating competitions held in the Philippines.\nThe Collector highlighted that the state government views education and sports as complementary, and she urged schools to nurture both equally. She called for immediate steps to improve Class 10 results by organising special coaching in subjects like Mathematics and Physics for underperforming students. “Form peer learning groups to help one another. Students must study with passion and lift each other,” she said.\nThe collector instructed schools to prioritise digital classrooms and computer lab use, particularly from Classes 6 to 10.

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), said it was the “Dravidian model of government” that had brought in and implemented several schemes to ameliorate the Adi-Dravidars and Scheduled Tribes in the State’s history. But, these schemes alone were not enough and “we have to go several miles to reach the goals of self-respect and society without discrimination.“\nAfter launching the State-wideUngaludan Stalin(Stalin with you) initiativeand inaugurating thememorial halland statue of former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) presidentL. Elayaperumal, a prominent leader who belonged to the Scheduled Caste, in Chidambaram, Mr. Stalin said the government has nowremoved the word ‘colony’(indicating a habitation of SCs) from official records as it had come to symbolise oppression and carried the connotation of untouchability.\nAs part of these efforts, the government has also removed caste markers and renamed all hostels being run by various departments of the Tamil Nadu government as‘Social justice hostels.’The journey to social liberation is a long one and will take time. But everything will change and Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin will make the change to reach the goals with the path shown by Elayaperumal., he said.\nMr. Stalin said political parties and leaders championing the policies and principles of Dr. Ambedkar, Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi were in one platform and any plan of the “saffron power in Delhi” would not hold good against them.\nPaying rich tributes toElayaperumal, Mr. Stalin said he was in the league of veteran leaders like Iyothee Thass Pandithar, Rettaimalai Srinivasan, M.C. Rajah, N. Sivaraj, L.C. Gurusamy, Swami Sagajanandar, among others who worked for social reforms in the society.\nThe late leader, who worked for the rights of Scheduled Caste community, was agitated on noticing ‘two pot system’ even during his school days and acted against it. Even after joining the army, he flagged the discrimination with superior officers and it was resolved, the Chief Minister said. Mr. Stalin recalled a report tabled by Elayaperumal in Parliament despite an attack on his office was the basis for the enactment of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\nReferring to theUngaludan Stalininitiative, the Chief Minister said a total of 10,000 special camps will be organised across rural and urban areas from today. As many as 46 services from various departments will be made available at the camps. Besides, medical services will be provided at each camp\nMr. Stalin said trained volunteers will visit each household and inform people about the date and location of these camps. They will also explain the various government services being provided, the eligibility criteria and the documents required to avail the services. Women who are eligible but have been left out of theKalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogaican submit their applications at the camp, he said.\nThe Chief Minister also announced that a non-leather footwear manufacturing unit would be set up at Kodukkanpalayam in Cuddalore district at an investment of ₹75 crore. The unit will provide employment for about 12,000 women from the district, he added.\nMinisters M.R.K. Panneerselvam, K.N. Nehru, C.V. Ganesan, E.V. Velu, M.P. Saminathan, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan, MPs M.K. Vishnu Prasad and D. Ravikumar participated."

Services exports rose to $98.1 billion in the first quarter of this financial year, up nearly 11% from the $88.5 billion seen in the same quarter of 2024-25.\nMerchandise exports, however, grew 2% in the April-June 2025 quarter to $112.2 billion. However, Mr. Barthwal emphasised that a large part of this slowdown was due to falling petroleum prices, since India’s non-petroleum exports grew 6% during this period.\nIndia’s total imports grew 4.4% in Q1 of this financial year to $230.6 billion, with merchandise imports growing 4.2% and services imports growing 4.9% during this period."

However, the corporation has now reportedly reduced its land requirement to just 9 acres.\nThe land in question was initially acquired nearly 20 years ago for a private project. Due to the developer’s failure to make timely payments, it remained under the control of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). BMRCL had originally sought the land from KIADB to facilitate its infrastructure plans.\nSources said that during the high-level meeting chaired by Ms. Rajneesh, BMRCL confirmed a scaled-down land demand. This unexpected shift has raised eyebrows, especially since Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar and Industries Minister M.B. Patil had earlier assured that the land would be dedicated to support Bengaluru’s growing public transport infrastructure.\nFormer minister and Rajajinagar BJP MLA Suresh Kumar has strongly opposed any move to divert the land for private interests. He alleged that the city’s long-term mobility needs were being sidelined in favour of short-term gains."

Its leaders told the media on Tuesday that if there was no positive response to their suggestions during the proposed talks with Education department officials, protests would be intensified against the government.\nThe Samastha functionaries pointed out that there had been no response to a memorandum submitted by the organisation ahead of the implementation of the new timings. No talks were held either. The Samastha Kerala Madrasa Management Association subsequently declared that it would hold protests against the government across the State. However, General Education Minister V. Sivankutty spoke to Samastha president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal over phone on July 14 and expressed the government’s willingness to hold talks on the issue.\nM.T. Abdulla Musliyar, general secretary, Samastha Islam Religious Education Board, said that practical suggestions would be put forward during the talks. “If there is no positive response, all Samastha-affiliated organisations will jointly organise intensified protests. There is no going back on this. The government should take the people into confidence while taking decisions. Religion is a form of education and vice-versa. Religious education is a crucial component of Islam, it cannot be set aside,” he said.\nThe new timings were implemented to realise the target of 220 working days and 1,100 instructional hours for Class VIII as per the Right to Education Act and for Classes IX and X as per the Kerala Education Rules. Samastha secretary Umar Faizy Mukkom, central ‘mushawara’ member Bahauddin Nadwi, among others, were present at the press meet."

    "content": "HYDERABAD\nThere is no concept of floodwaters in the country, particularly while giving clearance to irrigation projects by various agencies implementing the river water related laws, and in case any water is referred to with that term it is only imaginary and illusionary as no project is given clearance based on floodwaters.\nThis was stated by former Advisor to the Ministry of Jal Shakti and former Chairman of the Task Force on Interlinking of Rivers Sriram Vedire here on Tuesday. In a presentation made on river water issues, particularly on ‘Godavari Waters: Facts and Figures – A Way Forward for Telugu States’, he stated that surplus water is saving of water by a basin-State in its allocated share at 75% dependability.\nHe explained that the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal had categorised the water in the basin as ‘all waters, remaining waters and specific numbers (waters)‘ — all translated as assured water by the Central Water Commission and the agency (CWC) had assessed the availability of 3,396.9 tmc ft water at 75% dependability, average flows at 4,535.1 tmc ft and the average water above 75% dependability at 1,138.2 tmc ft.\nThe average flows of about 3,000 tmc ft into sea for the last 57 years being cited by Andhra Pradesh, which includes the availability of 1,138.2 tmc ft flows above 75% dependability was mainly due to non-utilisation of assured water by the basin States Chhattisgarh, Telangana (both about 400 tmc ft each), Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha (to some extent) and also due to spillovers due to their limitations in the storage capacity and other operational constraints, Mr. Sriram noted.\nAs a result, the CWC’s assessment of average flows of about 1,138 tmc ft above 75% dependability would not sanctify their utilisation by any basin State as the water flowing downstream, including into sea, could not be differentiated as assured water or average water since several projects operate with varying storage capacities and with different operational protocols, the former MoJS Advisor pointed out.\nComing to the specific and contentious issue of A.P.’s proposal to take up Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project to utilise floodwaters, he observed that if A.P. was allowed to go ahead with the project based on floodwaters for being the terminal State in the basin it would stir up a hornet’s nest as every co-basin would go for new projects based on floodwaters. “It will be an endless game if every State starts building projects using floodwaters,” he said.\nIn case Chhattisgarh plans to utilise its share, it would have to be compensated in a different form or the Godavari-Cauvery Interlinking had to be reworked. He felt that more storage was required in the Godavari Basin for Telangana to utilise its share of water."

Positive thoughts must flourish in society. Students should avoid getting entangled in controversies and focus on academics to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s progress,” he said.\nElaborating on Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Mr. Lad said that through the Hindu Code Bill, Ambedkar ensured property rights for women and prioritised their educational and economic empowerment.\nMr. Lad emphasised that Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals must be embraced by all not just by members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the backward classes\nUnderscoring the need for students to be careful about social media, he asked them to seek the truth behind what is seen on social media.\n“Through study and understanding, real facts must be identified. When great leaders are spoken against, we must strongly condemn such acts,” he said.\nAmaresh Yatagal stressed the need for re-examining the contribution and history of Valmiki and Beda communities.

    "content": "Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of throwing the State’s higher education sector into total disarray and allowing petty power politics  between the Governor and the government to undermine the future of thousands of students.\nTalking to mediapersons at Kollam on Tuesday, Mr. Satheesan said that under the Left government, almost all of the universities in the State did not have Vice-Chancellors and several colleges did not have Principals. Several postgraduate courses have been discontinued, while several degree courses did not have any takers.\nThousands of certificates are awaiting the signature of the Vice-Chancellors and several new courses, the approval of the government. Most of the students are leaving the State to find better options for higher studies.\nThe students here are the victims of the political games being played by the Raj Bhavan and the government and yet, the State seems least bothered. The aggressive and violent protests being carried out on a daily basis is all because the Senate hall was given on rent for a private function, Mr. Satheesan pointed out.\nHe said that by openly threatening violence against voices of dissent, the State’s ruling front was promoting a dangerous political culture. The Ministers are now threatening their political opponents with dire consequences. The State’s health sector is wallowing in a deep crisis and now the government can have the satisfaction of bringing the higher education sector too to the brink of ruin, Mr. Satheesan said.\nHe alleged that the Chief Minister himself was the biggest Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) agent. He said that the person who secretly  held discussions with the RSS leadership was not V.D. Satheesan but Pinarayi Vijayan. It was Mr. Vijayan himself who won elections in 1977 with the RSS support, he alleged. He also accused Mr. Vijayan of cosying up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership on the sly, all the while watching out for Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on his back\nMr. Satheesan said  that the crisis within the Left front never makes headlines because the media chooses to play it down. A political party which is a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre is a constituent of the Left front  in Kerala, he pointed out.\nHe also accused the media of blowing up issues within the Congress out of proportion while at the same time turning a blind eye to the political violence being promoted openly by the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI)."

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nMr. Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15. However, he has made it clear that the government would acquire property of those farmers who have volunteered to give up their land for the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of a developed land.\nIn all government and aided schools in Karnataka, eggs are distributed as an additional nutrient along with mid-day meal to students from classes 1 to 10 six days a week, and bananas to those who do not receive eggs. However, of the 762 schools inspected across Karnataka by the Azim Premji Foundation for Development (APF), thedistribution was irregular in 568 schools.\nIt was found that the School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) had decided to distribute eggs to students three days a week and bananas on the remaining days. In some other schools, bananas were being given instead of eggs on Mondays and Saturdays. According to the report, the highest number of schools with irregular distribution was in Tumakuru district — 132.\nClose on the heels of Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Choudhary seeking a probe by Special Investigation Team (SIT) into alleged secret burial of bodies at Dharmasthala over a decade ago, the advocates representing the complainant in the case havealso favoured an SIT probe.\nOn July 15, advocates Ojaswi Gowda and Sachin Deshpande stated: “...We believe an SIT is indeed the most appropriate and necessary mechanism to unearth the truth and deliver justice in this profoundly disturbing case...” The duo stated that the broader advocate community has collectively urged them to press for formation of an SIT ‘under stringent and principled conditions’.\nThe Karnataka governmenttransferred 35 IPS officers, replacing heads of the Bengaluru crime branch and the traffic police department, on July 14. Karthik Reddy replaces M.N. Anucheth as Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Bengaluru. Mr. Anucheth has been posted as Deputy Inspector General of Police, Recruitment.\nThe State government also appointed Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP) for the three newly-created divisions within the Bengaluru police: Narayana M. as DCP Electronics City, Anita Bhimappa Haddannavar as DCP South West, and Nagesh D.L. as DCP North West.\nUnidentified persons locked up the gate of the Panchamasali Peetha, the headquarters of Sri Basava Jayamrutyunjaya Swamy, in Kudala Sangama in Bagalkot district on July 13 night. Iron gates have been put in the front, back and on the way to the staircase. But, the seer, who is touring Vijayapura district, saidhe had no idea who did it, or why.\nThere was a dispute between the seer and Vijayananda Kashappanavar, chairman of the All India Lingayat Panchamasali Trust, over setting up of an alternative religious centre for the community in Kudala Sangama. Amid speculation that the trust had erected the gates to lock out the seer, Mr. Kashappanavar said he had instructed the trust to lock up the premises as a security measure."

Ramchander Rao on Tuesday.\nDuring his presidential address at the State-level workshop for the local body elections held here for the party leaders and attended by Union Minister for Coal & Mines G. Kishan Reddy, MP D.K. Aruna and other top leaders, he pointed out that the party has always been against religious quotas and inserting them along with the BC is definitely an ‘anti-BC’ step.\nMr. Rao claimed that the party was in a good position and well poised to do well in the local body polls as was exemplified in the enthusiastic reception he had receiving during his maiden foray into his ‘home’ district of Nalgonda by different sections of people after he took over as the party chief. For this to translate into votes, the cadre and leaders should combine forces for growth of the party across the State, he said.\nEarlier, continuing his second day of the tour in Suryapet district after spending the night at his native village of Nallabandla Gudem, the BJP chief said he was inclined to create a ‘new political atmosphere’ to make politics ‘abusive-free’ and fight to spread the party ideology for the betterment of people and the State.\nAddressing an Intellectuals meeting at Kodad, he expressed concern that rival political leaders have been indulging in mudslinging against each other and using ‘abusive and unparliamentary language’. “Aggressiveness does not mean that the leader should shred his clothes or squat on the road using abusive language against his rivals. In politics , leaders might have differences on party ideology irrespective of their party affiliations. But it was not wise to indulge in using derogatory words against individuals”, he suggested.\nCalling upon youth to join politics for ‘purifying’ the political atmosphere , the BJP chief has urged social media platforms not to vitiate the political atmosphere by disseminating false and wrong news without ascertaining the facts of the story. Social media platforms should not create ‘social animosity’ and ‘create confusion in the minds of people,” he said."

Red gram grown in Kalaburagi is renowned for its superior quality the world over.\nIt has also received GI (Geographical Indication) tag.\nThe Minister emphasized that “the Narendra Modi-led government’s import policy has put our farmers in hardship”.\nIn 2024-25, though farmers across India produced 35 lakh tonnes of red gram, the Centre procured less than 10% of the total cultivation.\nKarnataka produced one lakh tonnes but farmers were forced to sell their produce at ₹6,000 per quintal much less than the minimum support price of ₹7,550. Even this year, red gram price has plummeted to ₹6,250 in the market against the minimum support price of ₹8,000 per quintal, he said.\nThe Minister accused the Centre of choosing to flood the market with cheap, poor quality red gram from other countries abandoning local farmers. Since May 2021, red gram imports have been duty-free. This exemption has been extended until March 2026. In 2024-25, India imported more than 13 lakh tonnes of red gram and MoUs with countries like Mozambique have been signed to import additional two lakh tonnes, he said.\nMr. Kharge noted that even though a Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices report acknowledges that Karnataka demanded minimum support price of ₹16,548 per quintal, with cost of production amounting to ₹11,032 per quintal, the Central government has fixed minimum support price at ₹8,000 per quintal of red gram.\nIt seems that the Union Ministers from Karnataka are more focused on spreading hatred than standing up to protect the interests of the State they represent, Mr. Kharge said."

Their phones, once thought gone for good, were returned by the Kottayam Police at a brief event held at the office of the District Police Chief the other day.\nThe successful recoveries were the result of a joint operation by the Kottayam Cyber Police and the Cyber Cell, who launched a campaign to track mobile phones reported missing from various parts of the district over the past six months. During the event, District Police Chief Shahul Hameed A. personally handed the devices back to their rightful owners.\nWhat made the operation even more remarkable was the reach of the recovery effort as several of these stolen phones were traced to distant States such as Bengal, Assam, and Bihar. From the Government Medical College here alone, 14 phones were retrieved based on individual complaints. Another 10 were recovered from the Nagampadam St. Antony’s Church area.\nSpeaking at the event, the District Police Chief highlighted the importance of timely complaint registration.\n“Losing a mobile phone today is like losing a vital part of your daily life. Our aim is not only to recover the devices but also to build public confidence in the system. We want people to understand that filing a complaint can make a real difference,” he said.\nAccording to the official, the even was organised in a bid to raise awareness, encourage public participation, and  to show that the police take every complaint seriously."

They have not been fair in the inquiry and blamed my daughter, instead of the accused teacher who indulged in sexual and mental harassment of my daughter,” the father said.\nHe claimed that based on the ICC report, the principal told my daughter that she was at fault and may be punished for making a false allegation against the teacher who is the head of the Education department.\nThe second-year Integrated B.Ed student of Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College in Balasore immolated her shortly after coming out of the Principal's chamber.\n“Let the ICC members come under the purview of the investigation,” her father said.\nHe complained against the ICC to Balasore district collector Suryawanshi Mayur Vikas and Superintendent of Police Raj Prasad, who visited the deceased student's residence to handover the state government’s ex-gratia.\nBalasore MP also expressed his concern over the ICC report on her allegation of sexual and mental harassment.\nThe Principal and the accused teacher were both suspended and subsequently arrested.\nMeanwhile, the Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College remained closed for the day, and there was heavy deployment of police force on the campus.\nSeveral student organisations held demonstrations in different parts of Balasore town and demanded justice for the deceased.\nThe student's father, however, urged all not to politicise the matter.\n“My daughter is gone. I appeal to all—please don’t use her for political gain. However, I will keep fighting so that she gets justice,” he said.\nThe father said he received a message from Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi.\n“Sir (the CM) sent me an SMS and assured me of a proper investigation. I have faith in the government, administration, and the rule of law.” He also expressed gratitude for the government’s support for the treatment of his daughter.\n“She was provided with the best medical care at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. The doctors and staff were extremely supportive. I am deeply thankful,” he said.\nThe student's mother said that she now hopes that her daughter’s death will ensure the safety of other female students in colleges and schools.\n“I hope the system will improve following the death of my daughter,” she said.\n(Those in distress or having suicidal thoughts are encouraged to seek help and counselling by calling the helpline numbers here)"

However, he was asked to return at the last minute. The senior IAS officers of Shivamogga district administration stated that they had been instructed not to attend the event.\n“Later, the executive engineer and assistant executive engineers of the PWD also left the venue along with mementos and shawls arranged to felicitate the guests. Somehow, we arranged the mementos with the help of our leaders and managed the event,” said Mr. Raghavendra.\nHe that he met Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari in Delhi on June 25 and informed him that the bridge should be inaugurated at the earliest. The plan was to allow the public to utilise the bridge in the current rainy season itself. “They have suffered without road connectivity all these years. If the water level in the Linganmakki Dam increases by another 10 ft, we could not operate ferries. Considering this situation, the programme was scheduled, and the Chief Minister’s office was also informed well in advance. In fact, I know Mr. Siddaramaiah happily accepted the invitation when the officers met him in this regard. But later he was misled about the event,” he said.\nMr. Raghavendra was of the view if the Chief Minister himself had informed Mr. Jarkiholi to take part in the programme to represent the State government. “Otherwise, Mr. Jarkiholi would not have travelled to Sagar. But he returned without attending the programme. Union Minister Gadkari also felt bad about this development,” he said.\nMr. Raghavendra said that he would accept the Chief Minister’s busy schedule. However, the he was informed in advance, and he could have arranged to take part in it.\nFormer Minister Hartal Halappa alleged that Mr. Madhu Bangarappa had an inferiority complex to attend the programme, as his role in making the bridge happen was nothing. “Out of inferiority complex, he misled the Chief Minister and ensured that the State government boycott the programme. Similarly, Mr. Belur Gopala Krishna often said that the bridge would not become a reality. He also skipped the programme, even after openly announcing that he would definitely take part in it. I don’t know what made him change his decision suddenly,” he said.\nThe Sigandur Chowdeshwari bridge built across Sharavati backwaters in Sagar was inaugurated on Monday. The representatives of the State government skipped the event. Mr. Siddaramaiah has written to the Prime Minister, complaining to him about the violation of protocol in organising the event."

Having served over 14 years of her life sentence, she was deemed eligible for premature release. Subsequently, the Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services referred the matter to the government, paving the way for her release. The decision was made under Article 161 of the Constitution, which grants the Governor the power to remit sentences.\nAn official order, issued by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Bishwanath Sinha, has been forwarded to the State Police Chief, Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services, and the Superintendent of the Women’s Prison in Kannur. Her release is part of a broader recommendation involving 11 inmates proposed for sentence remission.\nSherin’s prison record has not been without controversy. Her tenure in jail included multiple paroles and disciplinary issues. In February, she was accused of assaulting a fellow inmate, and she had previously been transferred from Poojappura and Viyyur prisons."

We need to understand that, unless we study the matter, we will not know whether it’s good or bad. The trials are for research purposes only, and we are not going to recommend that it (GM maize) should be grown commercially or not. It’s for the Central government to take a call. We would be conducting the trials adhering to the guidelines of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and established standards of procedures. It’s a research institute, and it’s our mandate to conduct research,” Mr. Gosal  said.\nThe Coalition for a GM-Free India, a platform advocating safe and sustainable agriculture, has urged the Punjab government to withdraw its No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the trials.\nIn a letter to Punjab Agriculture Minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian, Kavitha Kuruganti, co-convenor of the coalition, said that the State government had an issued order prohibiting the usage of glyphosate, a deadly herbicide with a large body of scientific literature pointing to its negative impacts on human health and the environment.\n“...How can the university experiment with herbicide-tolerant maize that has been modified to withstand the application of glyphosate, which is in itself against the legally-approved label claim for glyphosate in India’s pesticides regulatory regime?” Ms. Kuruganti said.\nIn 2018, the Punjab government banned the sale of glyphosate, a herbicide used extensively in the State to control a wide variety of weeds in almost all crops.\nPointing out that the State government’s NOC would result in national repercussions, Ms. Kuruganti urged the State to prioritise an inquiry into the scientific basis on which such NOCs were being issued, and to immediately withdraw the NOC that has been issued for confined field trials on GM maize."

Patil in New Delhi on Wednesday following strong objection raised by Telangana over the agenda fixed for the meeting — to discuss the Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project proposed by A.P.\nIn a letter addressed to MoJS Secretary Debashree Mukherjee in response to the meeting notice, Chief Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao mentioned that Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and Minister for Irrigation N. Uttam Kumar Reddy had repeatedly communicated Telangana’s objections to the project proposed by A.P.\nThey had been clearly stating that the A.P.’s proposal violates the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT) Award as also the A.P. Reorganisation Act. It also lacks statutory clearances from the Central Water Commission, Godavari and Krishna River Management Boards and the Apex Council. The pre-feasibility report submitted by A.P. contains critical data gaps and methodological deficiencies, particularly on water availability assumptions and technical feasibility, the Chief Secretary said in his letter.\nFurther, the expert appraisal committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forest had returned the project proposal citing violations of legal and procedural aspects and the GRMB had observed that diversion of 200 tmc ft water from Polavaram for the proposed project would change scope as well as operation schedule of the Polavaram project, which already has unresolved submergence issues in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Telangana.\nStating that the AP’s proposal would undermine the rights of Telangana in Godavari water, he urged the MoJS Secretary to direct CWC to reject the pre-feasibility report of Banalacherla project, prevent A.P. from submitting detailed project report, stop finalising tenders and not to discuss/approve at any forum/by any agency.\nHe also cited the objections raised by the Polavaram Project Authority, GRMB, CWC and EAC of MoEF on A.P.’s proposal. The Chief Secretary, however, welcomed the initiative of the MoJS to convene a meeting to sort out the other outstanding issues, provided the meeting agenda is revised by including the issues raised by Telangana in another letter such as clearance to Godavari Basin projects based on assured water and issues in the Krishna Basin — clearances to the projects proposed in Telangana by the erstwhile A.P."

On Tuesday, the Kerala Students Union (KSU), the party’s student wing, staged a massive protest outside the college. The dharna that followed was inaugurated by MP, Anto Antony, who expressed his willingness to allot a bus to the college through his MP fund.\n“There is no way a government institution like this can function without approval from the Indian Nursing Council. If the Left Democratic Front government is willing to address the shortcomings and complete the required documentation within a set time frame, I am ready to take up the responsibility of securing INC approval within just a month,” said Mr. Antony, also a former parliamentary representative on the council.\nThe college has been in the eye of a storm over its lack of basic amenities and the absence of recognition from the INC. The institution began functioning in 2023 with an initial batch of 60 students under temporary approval from the Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS) and the Kerala Nursing Council. However, even after two years, the college has failed to obtain the mandatory INC recognition, leaving students concerned about the validity of their degrees.\nKerala Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Anish Varikkannamala and KSU district president Allen Geo Michael led the protesters, who began a march from Stadium Junction. On reaching the college entrance, they attempted to break through a police barricade, prompting a police intervention The police used force to disperse the crowd and forcibly relocating the activists to a police bus.\nCurrently operating out of a rented building, the college lacks even fundamental infrastructure, including properly equipped laboratories crucial for clinical training, the students alleged. Despite repeated appeals to the Health Minister and other authorities, no action has been taken. With graduation looming, the students say their futures hang in uncertainty."

    "content": "The kerosene ration allocated to the tribal panchayat in Edamalakudy has been lying unclaimed for the past two years, even as residents depend on firewood, solar lamps, and battery torches to meet lighting purposes.\nOnly 110 of the 800 houses in the village have power connections. According to officials, the Devikulam Girijan Cooperative Society, which is in charge of  ration distribution at Edamalakudy, stopped ration kerosene supply in April 2023.\nKanthiraj, a resident of the Edalipparakkudy tribal settlement, says they have not received kerosene from the ration shop in the past two years. “Kerosene was used for lighting lamps in homes, and after the distribution stopped, families are using solar light, battery torches, and firewood  during night, which has added to our financial burden,“ he says. Sreekrishnan, a resident of the Shedukudy tribal settlement, says the same is the case in his settlement\nResidents say the electrification process has been completed in only three of the 26 settlements in Edamalakkudy.\n“As there is no electricity connection for over 500 families in the settlement, they are eligible for six litre of kerosene every three months. However, the Girijan society stopped  kerosene collection from April 2023 onwards. As per the rule, the licensee must collect the kerosene allotment and ensure distribution to the cardholders,”  says Sanjaynath R., civil supply officer of Devikulam taluk.\n“For the past two years, the society has not collected 14,500 litres of kerosene meant for Edamalakkudy.  Citing that kerosene has not been collected for over two years, the Civil Supplies department has slapped a penalty of ₹9,79,090 on the tribal cooperative society functioning in the area. Though rice and other essential items are provided free of charge, the price of kerosene must be paid for in advance. The price of one litre of kerosene is ₹65,” he says.\nMeanwhile, the State Food Commission intervened to ensure proper ration distribution at Edamalakkudy.\nChairperson Ginu Zacharia Oommen said the commission, on receiving a report from the Idukki district supply officer,  directed the Tribal Welfare department and the Integrated Tribal Development Project office to ensure a proper system for smooth ration distribution in the tribal panchayat."

    "content": "The State government has informed the Kerala High Court that a legislation banning black magic, sorcery and other superstitious practices is under consideration and that the Cabinet had earlier postponed a decision on this due to the ‘legal complexities’ involved.\nBased on this, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Basant Balaji sought details of the ‘legal complexities’ with regard to the legislation. When the government stated that action was hitherto being taken as per the BNS, Police Act, POCSO Act and other legislations, the court sought details like the number of cases registered in this connection during the past five years and the action taken. The case has been posted for hearing on August 5.\nThe government had submitted before the High Court in June that it would not proceed to enact a law to ban such practices, citing a policy decision made by the State Cabinet. This was in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham that sought a law similar to those enacted in Maharashtra and Karnataka to prohibit harmful rituals. The PIL was filed in 2022 in the wake of a ritual human sacrifice of two women in the Pathanamthitta district by three people.\nIn an affidavit filed before a Division Bench of the High Court,  the government had said in June that a draft Bill titled ‘The Kerala Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices, Sorcery and Black Magic Bill, 2022’ had been prepared based on recommendations from the Law Reforms Commission. However, after deliberations, the Council of Ministers decided on July 5, 2023, not to go ahead with the legislation. While the court may have noted the social concerns raised in the PIL, it cannot compel the legislature to pass a law. A writ of mandamus will not lie against the legislature directing it to legislate on a particular subject, the government had submitted in its June affidavit.\nSubsequently, the High Court had asked the State government to clarify on the steps it intended to take to control sorcery and black magic, especially in light of the government’s stand that no legislation was currently under consideration. Stating that the K.T. Thomas Commission report had recommended legislation to curb black magic and related inhuman practices and that the government had not taken any follow up action on the report, the court had in June directed the State to clearly explain how it planned to prevent the practice of black magic and sorcery, even in the absence of a law."

    "content": "In separate incidents of cyber fraud, two senior citizens in Hyderabad have been duped of over ₹58.8 lakh after falling prey to a deceptive online schemes, one through an Instagram-based trading platform, and the other via a misleading YouTube advertisement promising a high-value coin sale.\nIn the first case, a 60-year-old resident of Jubilee Hills lost over ₹57.4 lakh after being misled by a fraudulent investment platform called “FX Road”. The victim came across the platform through an Instagram advertisement, which led him to engage with individuals posing as ‘trading experts’. After convincing him to register and sign documents digitally, they guided him to invest via credit card payments and bank transfers, claiming the funds were being used to trade in crude oil, precious metals, company stocks like Tesla, and cryptocurrencies.\nTo build trust, the platform initially displayed fake profits. Later, the scammers pressured the victim to deposit more funds to maintain “margin levels” as the market became volatile. This led him to borrow ₹7–8 lakh from Navi, a financial services platform, and pledge his ICICI Prudential Savings Suraksha policy to raise an additional ₹17.5 lakh.\nHe was further asked to deposit a further ₹25–32 lakh. Realising he had been deceived, the victim reported the matter to the national cybercrime helpline (1930). Investigations later revealed that the fraudsters had impersonated representatives of a reputed brokerage firm, Trade Bulls, and used forged documents to run a well-orchestrated scam.\nIn a second incident, a 68-year-old resident of Dar-ul-shifa lost over ₹1.46 lakh after responding to a YouTube advertisement falsely claiming that a ₹20 coin could be sold for ₹50 lakh. Tempted by the offer, the victim called the number provided and was contacted by a man who identified himself as “Raj Gyani.” Claiming to be a collector, the fraudster initially requested ₹1,500 to “create a file” for the transaction, then continued to extract money under various pretexts including documentation and clearance charges.\nTrusting the process, the victim transferred multiple payments totalling ₹1,46,100. When the fraudster demanded an additional ₹1 lakh, the victim realised he had been conned and subsequently reported the fraud to the cybercrime helpline.\nInvestigation is underway."

    "content": "As the Government of Andhra Pradesh prepares to launch another Super Six scheme of free bus travel for women in the State on August 15, deliberations are in progress over the exact mode of implementation.\nWhile Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has indicated that the district will be considered as a unit for implementing the scheme, key stakeholders, including officials of the A.P. State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), have expressed concern over the feasibility of the model.\nAccording to sources in the Transport Department, implementation of the scheme at the district level may lead to operational difficulties, besides complications in route monitoring and enforcement of eligibility across inter-district services.\nA more unified State-wide implementation, the officials feel, will ensure smoother coordination and reduce the risk of misuse, or logistical bottlenecks.\n“Restriction on travel within districts will lead to confusion for women who need to travel across district borders. A uniform policy at the State level will be more inclusive and manageable,” says a senior APSRTC official.\n“A final call on the issue will be taken after the Chief Minister returns from Delhi,” says Transport Minister M. Ramprasad Reddy.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, Mr. Ramprasad Reddy said the government was in the process of procuring 2,000 new buses to augment the existing fleet and support the anticipated surge in passengers once the scheme was launched. “While the buses may not arrive in time for the rollout, they will be inducted into the fleet in a phased manner,” the Minister said.\nCurrently, women commuters comprise 35% of the Occupancy Ratio (OR) in the APSRTC buses as against 65% men. “After rolling out the scheme, the number of women passengers may rise to 65% of the OR,” said the Minister.\nFrom a financial standpoint, the Minister said it would be an annual expenditure of ₹2,000 crore, which was significantly lower than other schemes under the government’s Super Six promises.\nMr. Ramprasad Reddy said the new buses would be operated under the Gross Cost Contract (GCC) model, a framework where private operators supply and maintain buses, while the APSRTC would manage operations and collect revenue.\nHowever, the GCC model is being opposed by the A.P. Public Transport Department Employees’ Unions, whihc fear losing jobs in the future. They have been insisting that the APSRTC operate and maintain the new buses proposed to be included in the fleet.\n“Already, 25% of the buses in the fleet are being operated by private firms. This is a growing concern among the workers in the public transport organisation,” said union State president P. Damodar Rao.\nHe said the existing 11,500 buses in the fleet and 46,000 staff were needed to be augmented before the launch of the scheme. “The corporation already relies on over 5,000 on-call drivers for its day-to-day operations,” he said, indicating the extent of staff crunch."

    "content": "About 30 acres of railway land in Tiruchi has been earmarked for setting up a dedicated facility for the maintenance of Vande Bharat Express trains.\nThe land is near the upcoming Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) shed near Manjathidal railway station. It was identified by the authorities of the Golden Rock Railway Workshop here.  Ashish Sharma, Additional Member (Mechanical Engineering), Railway Board, New Delhi, visited the site on Thursday.\nThe Railway Board nominated the Golden Rock Railway Workshop two months ago to undertake SS-I (Shop Schedule) and other major schedules of the Vande Bharat train sets in the place of Perambur Workshop in Chennai. This is a ₹300-crore project. “If required, more railway land will be utilised,” said the workshop authorities.\nThe workshop has prepared the abstract estimate for the establishment of the new facility and it will be reviewed by the Southern Railway. The estimate includes machinery and plant requirements, civil works, and overhead electrical arrangements required for the maintenance of Vande Bharat coaches, the authorities said.\nBuilt during the British era, the Golden Rock Railway Workshop takes up a variety of tasks such as periodic overhaul of diesel locomotives and passenger coaches, manufacture of wagons and automobile carriers besides undertaking periodic overhauling of steam locomotives operated in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway section.\nSome technical personnel of the workshop were sent to various railway workshops across  the country handling the maintenance of Vande Bharat coaches to gain first hand experience and ascertain the requirements for setting up the facility in Tiruchi.  The Vande Bharat trains have strong safety features, including the Kavach safety system, and can run up to a speed of 160 kmph."

    "content": "Temperatures have continued to soar across Telangana over the past week, with no rainfall recorded during this period, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has confirmed.\nSpeaking to The Hindu, Dharma Raju, scientist from IMD Hyderabad centre attributed the heatwave-like conditions to the absence of atmospheric moisture and the shifting of monsoon systems towards the northeast and northwest regions of the country. “There has been no rain over the last week, which has led to a rise in temperatures. Even coastal cities like Visakhapatnam and Kakinada are seeing temperatures in the range of 36°C to 39°C, with some places even touching 40°C,” the official said.\nIn Telangana, daytime temperatures have hovered around 35°C across many districts. The scientist said that although conditions are otherwise favourable for monsoon activity, there has been a lack of sufficient moisture build-up in the atmosphere over the southern peninsula, including Telangana and the coastal belt.\n“Most weather systems are currently active over north-eastern and north-western India. As a result, despite favourable monsoon conditions, the required atmospheric support to generate rains in our region has been lacking,” the scientist explained.\nHowever, there may be some relief in sight. The IMD has forecast light to moderate rainfall beginning July 17 across isolated parts of Telangana, with the possibility of heavy showers on July 18 and 19. “From July 17 onwards, rainfall activity is expected to pick up and continue until around July 22,” the official added."

    "content": "The number of criminal cases registered under the Protection of Civil Rights Act (PCR Act), 1955, for offences related to “untouchability” has seen a decline, with pendency in courts remaining above 97% and nearly all disposed cases resulting in acquittals, according to the Union government’s 2022 annual report on the implementation of the law. The report was recently made public by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.\nThe Act is intended to define various manifestations of untouchability, including in social and religious spheres, and prescribe penalties. It mandates an annual review report with inputs from States and Union Territories, covering aspects such as case registration, pendency in police and courts, establishment of special courts and police stations, and inter-caste marriage incentives, among others.\nAccording to data provided to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 13 cases were registered under the PCR Act across the country in 2022 — a decline from 24 in 2021 and 25 in 2020. These cases were reported from Jammu and Kashmir (5), Karnataka (5), Maharashtra (2), and Himachal Pradesh (1). Of the 51 cases pending with police during 2022, including those from previous years, chargesheets were filed in 12.\nAlso Read |Untouchability is being practised in the country in myriad ways, says Madras High Court\nThe report also noted that none of the States or Union Territories that submitted data had declared any area within their jurisdiction as “untouchability prone”.\nAt the court level, a total of 1,242 cases were pending trial under the Act. Of the 31 cases disposed of by courts in 2022, one resulted in a conviction, while the remaining 30 ended in acquittals. A review of previous annual reports showed that all 37 PCR Act cases disposed of by courts between 2019 and 2021 also ended in acquittals.\nIn contrast, the number of cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, has risen steadily, with 62,501 cases reported in 2022. Pendency figures under this Act stood at over 17,000 cases with police and over 2.33 lakh with courts across the country.\nA review of past reports in the PCR Act further revealed that the number of cases registered under this law started reducing after 1989, when the Prevention of Atrocities Act was enacted.\nThe 2022 report also documented that 18,936 inter-caste marriage couples were given financial incentives of ₹2.5 lakh each under the PCR Act across 21 States and Union Territories. Maharashtra reported the highest number of beneficiaries at 4,100, followed by Karnataka (3,519) and Tamil Nadu (2,217).\nHowever, several States — including Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand — did not provide data regarding inter-caste marriage incentives. In addition, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Lakshadweep submitted “NIL” information with respect to the implementation of the PCR Act, while Manipur did not submit any input despite repeated reminders."

This facility is already being used by devotees from the State.\nMr. Reddy said that the Peethadhipathi of Sri Raghavendra Swamy Math has told him that he will get a suitable place allotted for the construction of boarding facility at Mantralayam for devotees from Karnataka.\n“The Transport Department operates 200 buses from various parts of the State to Mantralayam and many devotees also travel by trains to the pilgrim place. As more than 60% of devotees among daily visitors to Mantralayam are from Karnataka, the State government is keen on constructing boarding houses there,” Mr. Reddy said.\nMr. Reddy said that in the newly constructed boarding house, a total of 50 rooms are available for devotees from Karnataka. Online booking will be be made available for only 30 rooms and the remaining 20 will be available for direct booking.\n“The rates for occupying a single room by four persons is ₹500 for 12 hours from the booking time. However, ₹1,000 will be charged beyond 12 hours for the same accommodation,” he said.\nThe Tourism Department has been entrusted with the management of the boarding house to ensure high standards. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh recently wrote to the departments concerned asking them to settle land disputes at Mantralayam, Srisailam and Tirupati. This will now enable Karnataka in building more boarding houses for its devotees, he said.\nTourism Commissioner Venkatesh, Deputy Commissioner Nitish K., Deputy Director of Tourism Sri Krishna Shavantageri, Divisional Controller of Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation Chandrasekhar, Kishore Kumar Patil and Anjeneya were present."

However, he was informed only a couple of days before the event. By then, his visit to Indi in Vijayapura was already scheduled.\n“The BJP leaders thought that the Chief Minister would speak about the tax collection and the dues from the Centre. To avoid embarrassment, they did not invite him in advance. MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi planned and executed the programme,” he remarked.\nHe maintained that the State government had been taking up many development works for the State, including the Sharavati Pumped Storage project. “It intends to generate 2,000 MW of power. The Central government has also given its consent for the project, which is being executed at a cost of ₹8,644 crore,” he said.\nRegarding the opposition to the project, Mr. Krishna said that the opposition from environmentalists was expected. However, the project would not disturb the local habitats to a large extent. A few families, which would be affected, had been convinced. The government would consider their demands, including jobs, with the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, he added."

The municipal council had earmarked ₹4 crore towards the reclamation of the land.\nThe municipal secretary had written to the taluk surveyor, Kanayannur, on April 9, 2025, requesting the authority to prepare a proper revenue survey sketch of the land. It was mentioned that immediate steps were required owing to the priority accorded to the project. The civic authorities said they had yet to receive the revenue sketch.\nMunicipal chairperson Radhamani Pillai said the Central and State governments should make their positions clear on whether they were keen on realising the project on the land at Thengode. Though the council had earmarked ₹4 crore for reclamation, there has not been much progress as expected, she said.\nThe district administration had informed the Land Revenue Commissioner on June 27, 2023, that the six-acre land at Thengode was suitable for the project. However, the municipality required nod from the Revenue department as the land was mentioned as ‘puramboke kulam’ in the basic tax register.

    "content": "The 1,198-day protest by farmers from 13 villages in Devanahalli taluk, demanding the withdrawal of the notification for the acquisition of 1,777 acres of farmland for the Aerospace Park, is a landmark struggle considering its seriousness, impact, and the attention it caught beyond Karnataka. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah described it as “historic” whileannouncing the decision to shelve the land acquisition process.\nThough farmers have resisted land acquisition in several places in the State in the past, the resistance by Devananhalli farmers caught the attention mainly for their grit and endurance as they managed to carry on with their protest for a long duration.\nIn fact, it was a protest launched by a group of local farmers who had witnessed how the earlier land acquisition processes had reduced some of the landowners to landless labourers. Commitment to the cause and determination helped them to pull along for such a long time. This became a broad-based struggle later, with several progressive organisations expressing their support for the fight.\nObservers feel that the Devanahalli struggle has gone a long way in creating awareness about the plight of land-losers, particularly as prominent personalities from various walks of life lent their moral support to it. The pressure had started mounting on the Karnataka government ascivil society groups had petitioned the Congress high command, while national-level farmer leaders too had threatened to launch a protest similar to that of the 13-month-long stir held at the borders of New Delhi.\nWhile Mr. Siddaramaiah eventually stood with farmers by announcing complete shelving of the land acquisition process, the struggle is expected to have an impact beyond Devanahalli. Some of the key issues raised, such as the need for a pragmatic approach to land acquisition and a land-use policy for industries to determine the extent of land required for different kinds of industries, among others, are expected to gain currency in the coming days. Those who were part of the struggle feel that a clear policy is the need of the hour, as there has to be a healthy balance between industrial development and agriculture, as industrialisation too is crucial for the State’s development.\nAlso, there is a view that the very concept of “development” should be redefined. This was echoed by farmer leader Chukki Nanjundaswamy, who argued that development cannot be achieved by excluding agriculture and farmers. “Development should be inclusive of farmers and agriculture,” she said, while addressing farmers after the government announced its decision to shelve the land acquisition process in Devanahalli.\nLand acquisition elsewhere in the State, in future, will need special attention on the livelihood of land-losers as the Devanahalli protest and its impact has set a precedent."

The accused, identified as Kunjumon of Kaviyoor, near Thiruvalla, was found to have allowed the minor to drive the vehicles and film the act.\nThe incident came to light during a police inquiry into a harassment complaint against the boy, a Plus Two student from Kuttapuzha. While recording his statement, the student revealed that he had also operated heavy vehicles and posted the footage as  reels on his social media page.\nActing on this information, the Thiruvalla police examined the videos and submitted a report to the Joint RTO, recommending strict action against the vehicle owner. The report, filed by police inspector S. Santosh, noted that such behaviour sends a harmful message to society.\nFollowing a detailed investigation, the Joint RTO found the vehicle owner guilty of permitting a minor to operate heavy machinery. The boy reportedly drove the vehicles at an excavation site in the Kuttoor area with the owner’s consent. The videos have since been deleted from the boy’s social media account."

    "content": "The UK committee of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) on Monday (July 14) opened a full-fledged office, the outfit’s maiden such office abroad, at Southall, West London, with a sizeable concentration of the Indian community.\nIncidentally, when the UK committee was launched at the foundation conference on June 4, 2022, it was also the first international unit of the SFI. The organisation now has a presence in 30 universities across the UK, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with a total of 341 members at last count, with a majority of them being students from Kerala, according to the organisers.\n“We have been able to create a structure under the UK committee in the last three years and have now organisation committees in six cities — London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and Portsmouth — while there are members from even more cities. Incidentally, a majority of our members are first-timers who did not have any previous association with the organisation when they were back home,” said Nikhil Mathew, secretary, UK committee.\nP.S. Sanjeev, SFI Kerala State secretary, said the UK committee opening an office was a significant development, indicating the increasing relevance of the outfit beyond. It was indeed the outfit’s first major office on foreign soil, he said.\nHe added that the organisation’s UK committee primarily intervenes in the issue of racism faced by foreign students from academic and non-teaching staff alike. One of the most important interventions by the UK committee was against the mass failing of 70 students, predominantly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, at a university in Scotland, allegedly on racist grounds.\nHousing is another challenge that students from India are often caught unawares of, thanks to exploitation by agents. The SFI UK committee has identified this as another area for intervention to raise collective awareness about the issue among the student community.\nThe committee is set to host Sambhaji Bhagat, a Dalit activist and revolutionary balladeer, at the University of Edinburgh later this week. “We organise arts and sports fests and academic talks. The idea is to help Indian students remain connected to their cultural roots. We also want to help them deal with emerging problems like the change in immigration laws and increasing difficulty in finding jobs,” said Mr. Mathew, a final-year PhD student in International Development at the University of Edinburgh."

But I never faced such problems. But now I am forced to suffer like this for my statement,” he said.\n“Sunday’s development hurt me deeply. It is nice to see that it has had a happy ending.

But it pains me to see my followers suffering. I am not after any property or land.

Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

    "content": "The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) recorded a 36% increase in water tanker bookings by consumers in July, compared to data from previous years.\nThe trend may continue if the delay in rainfall persists in the coming weeks, the Board chief K. Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered. This, he said, would not only enable participation in democracy but also facilitate defending their rights and shape the nation’s future.\n“In our beloved country, there are big challenges for minorities and especially Muslims. We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

    "content": "The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has levied penalties of more than a crore rupees for various violations pertaining to sanitation since March 1 this year.\nThe penalties were charged through an exclusive app developed for this purpose, named Comprehensive Challan Management System (CCMS). Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

    "content": "Three migrants aboard a trailer were taken into custody by the Panangad police in the early hours of Tuesday (July 15) in connection with the suspected theft of a car from Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu. The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

    "content": "After a brief hiatus, the southwest monsoon conditions have strengthened across the State with the intensification of monsoon flow of wind from the Arabian Sea. North and central Kerala will have some intense spells of rain compared to the rest of State for the next week, with spillover rain even benefitting parts of south Kerala.\nThe peak monsoon feature offshore trough, which was in a feeble condition, has now turned into active mode with the trough extending from the Gujarat coast to the south Kerala coast on Tuesday. The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe current spell is likely to bridge the shortfall of July rain over the State, with the north half of Kerala having the lion’s share of rain, including parts of central Kerala. However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

However, Gnaneshwar allegedly continued to demand interest payment.\nThe father further stated that around three months ago, Ramakanth had another debt of ₹10,000. Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment.

    "content": "The administrative tussle at Kerala University showed no signs of abatement with Vice-Chancellor (V-C) in-charge Mohanan Kunnummal barring Registrar K.S. Anil Kumar from using his official vehicle on Tuesday.\nDr. Kunnummal has issued instructions to Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen, who has been given additional charge of Registrar, and the security wing to implement the order. However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

    "content": "Authorities of the South Central Railway (SCR) are awaiting the release of the Andhra Pradesh State government’s cost share to expedite the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project in the State.\nOriginally estimated at ₹1,445 crore, the project cost has increased to over ₹2,100 crore owing to the delays in execution. The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

The tainted toddy, sold at shops in Hydernagar, Shamshiguda, and SP Nagar, has so far claimed nine lives and left at least 50 others seriously ill.\n“We suspect that an overdose of alprazolam in the toddy may have triggered severe health complications, ultimately leading to death,” said Medchal district excise officer Shaik Fayazudeen.\nA medical expert familiar with the case noted that the effects of adulterated toddy can vary significantly from person to person, depending on factors such as age, existing medical conditions, and individual health history.\nAnother official involved in the toxicology analysis added that poor hygiene during the preparation process could also have contributed to symptoms like diarrhoea reported among several victims.\nA week after several residents of Kukatpally were hospitalised following the consumption of the adulterated toddy, many continue to remain in critical condition at the Gandhi Hospital and the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS).\nAs of July 15, nine patients are still undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital, with six of them reported to be in a critical state. The critically ill have been identified as Vadla Suggunamma, 61, Manjala Swapna, 26, K. Nirmala, 47, B. Latha, 55, K. Neela Reddy, 38, and Devalla Ananthamma, 45.\nAt NIMS, 17 patients continue to receive treatment. According to hospital authorities, four of them are clinically stable and expected to be discharged later on Tuesday. The remaining patients are being closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team.\nOn July 14, six patients were discharged after completing their course of treatment."

    "tags": [],
    "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png",
    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”"

Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

    "content": "Officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Bengaluru, uncovered an inter-State drug racket allegedly involving the African Drug Syndicate and seized 9 kg of methamphetamine in two separate operations on Tuesday.\nBased on the intelligence inputs on African drug traffickers transporting drugs via bus and air from Delhi by two networks, the NCB officials intercepted three foreign nationals and seized 7 kg and 2 kg of high-grade methamphetamine at the Majestic Bus Stand and Kempegowda International Airport in two different raids within three days.\nIn the first operation, 7 kg of methamphetamine was seized, which was sourced from Delhi and transported by an African national via bus through Mumbai to Bengaluru. To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933. The identity of the caller will be kept confidential, the release said."

Bindu said the panels will be submitted to the Governor at the earliest. “The Governor should be ready to adopt necessary action in a democratic manner,” she told media persons on Tuesday.\nShe added that any approach where the State government is denied any say in appointing Vice-Chancellors is autocratic.\nThe Raj Bhavan, on the other hand, is mulling over moving the Supreme Court to “seek clarity” in the judgement. While it has been examining legal advice on the matter, the Raj Bhavan could raise the contention of University Grants Commission Act and its regulations having precedence over State university laws. A counsel could also be sought on the criteria of appointing temporary Vice-Chancellors, sources said.\nThe Raj Bhavan had appointed K. Sivaprasad and Ciza Thomas as Vice-Chancellors in-charge of KTU and DUK respectively on November 27 last, ignoring the panels submitted by the State government.\nThe Higher Education Department had put forth a panel comprising Senior Joint Director of Technical Education Jayaprakash P., former KTU Registrar A. Praveen and former Syndicate member Vinod Kumar Jacob. In the case of DUK, the Electronics and Information Technology Department had submitted the names of Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment Executive Vice President K.P. Sudheer, former KTU Vice-Chancellor M.S. Rajasree and former Calicut University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj for the top post."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

Managing personal information of students or infringing upon the privacy of students was not the objective of the campaign, he clarified.\nAlong with the circular, senior officers of the departments have also sent a message to the teachers instructing them that there is no need to collect data or maintain a register with regard to the menstrual cycles of students.\nFollowing the news report, many people on social media platforms had expressed shock over the initiative and demanded that it be stopped.

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.

What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

Bindu calling for discussions on marks  processes and development of tools for the same.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the KHSTU said decisions taken without any discussions on such grave issues as normalisation had led to change in candidates’ ranks, putting students under immense stress and resulting in setbacks in courts. This created wrong precedent and allowed mistakes to continue, the association alleged.\nThe government should organise discussions and deliberation instead of taking unilateral decisions so that apprehensions of State higher secondary students’ who were unfairly disadvantaged could be addressed."

    "content": "The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) urged parents of children between the age of 5 and 7 to update their kids’ Aadhaar biometrics.\nIn the periodic reminder, the UIDAI said that the biometric update would be free of cost at enrolment centres, if done before children turned seven. After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema.

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."

The dam recorded an inflow of 25,478 cusecs. The dam has 76.5 tmcft of water or 72% of the full reservoir level.\nOfficials are not impounding water in the Hipparagi barrage. The dam recorded an inflow of 50,460 cusecs and an outflow of 49,810 cusecs. As inflow is high in the Krishna, the river is in a free flow state, hence storage is not done in the monsoon period, officers said in a release.\nThe Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir on the Krishna at Almatti recorded an inflow of 42,577 cusecs and an outflow of 25,000 cusecs.\nThe dam has 97.13 tmcft of water or 78.92% of the full reservoir level.\nThe Narayanpur dam recorded an inflow of 25,000 cusecs and an outflow of 3,000 cusecs.

An overhead of ₹1 lakh per annum has also been provisioned.\nThe Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), now subsumed under the ANRF, had earlier administered the SERB Distinguished Fellowship for retired scientists. That scheme offered a research grant of ₹20 lakh per annum and a monthly fellowship of ₹60,000.\nUnlike previous fellowships, the new initiative is also open to overseas scientists, including Non-Resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin, and Overseas Citizens of India. Additionally, professionals from industry and experienced Professors of Practice with a “distinguished record” of research and innovation are eligible to apply.\nA key distinction of the new programme is that recipients must be based at State universities that qualify as “spoke” institutions under Category A of the recently introduced Promoting Advanced and Inclusive Research (PAIR) programme of the ANRF.\nThe PAIR initiative links universities with nascent research ecosystems to top-tier institutions in a mentorship arrangement. Select Central Universities, National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been classified as “spoke” institutions, while institutions ranked 25 or below in the National Institutional Ranking Framework are designated as “hubs”.\nThe selected Professors are expected to relocate, if necessary, to the host university and provide “sustained academic and research support to faculty and students in institutions with emerging research capacity”.\n“Applicants with strong research credentials must be actively involved in research and innovation activities, and demonstrate a strong commitment to mentor faculty at the eligible State universities where research and innovation is still at a nascent stage,” stated a note from the ANRF announcing the fellowship."

    "content": "ThePahalgam terrorist attackof April 22 was carried out to hurt theJammu and Kashmireconomy and to “sow a religious divide”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (SCO-CFM) meeting in China, where other SCO Ministers — including Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar — were present, and called for support to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nOn Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Jaishankar and the other SCO Ministers from Russia, Iran, Belarus and Central Asian states called on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) before proceeding to the SCO meeting in Tianjin by train. The External Affairs Minister also held bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, both of whom he met earlier this month at the BRICS summit in Brazil.\nMr. Jaishankar’s comments came a month after the SCO Defence Ministers’ meeting failed to issue a joint statement following differences over the references to terrorism. While no statement was issued after the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting as well, officials said it was not the practice to do so, as the Foreign Ministers were normally tasked with finalising the agenda for the Summit of leaders on August 31-September 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Tianjin for the summit, which would be his first such visit since the Galwan clashes in 2020.\n“The three evils that SCO was founded to combat were terrorism, separatism and extremism,” Mr. Jaishankar said during his speech at the meeting, where he referred to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 men, mostly tourists, were religiously identified and killed. “It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide”, he added, calling for the SCO to take an “uncompromising position” on the challenge of terrorism, and referring to the UN Security Council resolution issued in April about the attack.\nMr. Jaishankar’s meeting with Mr. Xi came a day after he held bilateral talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he hailed the “continued normalisation” of India-China relations. The Minister said that he had apprised President Xi of recent developments in bilateral relations. “I value the guidance of our leaders in that regard”, he posted on X, referring to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi.\nChinese state media reported that Mr. Xi had told SCO Ministers that the organisation must play a “more proactive role” to ensure stability in a “turbulent and changing international landscape”. Most SCO countries, especially China and India, would be affected if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned law imposing 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil and sanctioned products.\nIn his comments during the SCO-CFM, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mr. Dar did not refer to the issue of terrorism. In a post on social media, Mr. Dar said that he “underscored the importance of upholding international law and implementing relevant UNSC resolutions to resolve longstanding disputes”, at the meeting and that Pakistan sought peace with “all its neighbours”.\nReferring to Afghanistan, which is an SCO observer state but has not been invited since 2021 when the Taliban regime took control of Kabul, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “compulsions of regional stability are buttressed by [India’s] longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people” and called for SCO members to increase development assistance.\nTaking a swipe at Pakistan for closing transit for India-Afghanistan trade, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “lack of assured transit within the SCO space…undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas”, and advocated for the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that runs through Iran."

    "content": "Deep inside Palani Hills in Kodaikanal taluk live a group of tribespeople who could have a livelihood boost due to a bunch of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) applications filed by a faculty member of Mother Teresa Women’s University.\nA. Usha Raja Nanthini, Professor and Head, Biotechnology Department, has filed 150 separate applications under industrial design for jewellery made with naturally-occurring seeds. The project, funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), aims to train the tribespeople in jewellery-making and help them market their products through a website.\nFive tribal women have come together to establish a company, Tulir, and registered it as a micro, small and medium enterprise. The website is being designed and will sell honey, nutmeg, lichens, benzoin resin (sambrani), and myrobalan (kadukkai), besides jewellery.\nMs. Usha said, “They live in 15-20 hamlets spread over Palani Hills and their population according to the 2011 Census was around 6,000. The children rarely go to school and they live a simple life collecting non-timber forest produce.”\nWhile being on a project to analyse different species of eucalyptus for anti-fungal properties, Ms. Usha and her team came across this habitation. Seeds of eucalyptus, adenanthera, coix and corymbia found in the area were colourful and tough, and they came in various sizes and shapes. “An idea sparked: if we designed jewellery and taught them how to make them, they could sell the products for a living.”\nA few prototypes of the jewellery designs were submitted to the TNSCST in August 2023 and the Council approved the project in January 2024. Then began the tough task of bringing the villagers together. “They were shy and would not entertain outsiders. So, we went through the tribal headman who helped us getting a few people,” Ms. Usha elaborated.\nThe training for the villagers began in January, and she filed the IPR applications through the IPR cell set up by the Council at the university in March. “The idea of setting up these cells is to protect our intellectual property and use them for the benefit of the people,” said S. Vincent, Member Secretary, TNSCST. The council has already set up 40 such cells.\nFifty villagers from Pethuparai Bharathi Annanagar and Pallangi-Kombai hamlets have been trained in jewellery-making, Ms. Usha said. As an aside, members of a women’s self help group from Vadakounji and Vadajaraparai were trained in apiculture (beekeeping), in collaboration with sisters from Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI).\nThe people living in these hamlets largely belonged to the Pazhiyar and Puliyar tribes and have been eking out a living, collecting lichens, soap nuts, gooseberry, honey and other non-timber forest produce and selling them to intermediaries for a pittance, Ms. Usha said. “The place is so remote that the nearest bus stop is 29 kilometres away. Very few have studied till high school,” she added."

The protest is to highlight the DMK government’s failure to implement 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Incidentally, Dr. Ramadoss’s residence is located at Thailapuram in Villupuram district.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, sources close to Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani  said fatigue had set in among the party cadre because of the feud, and this could affect the party’s performance in the 2026 Assembly election.\n“However, the protest against the DMK government would be huge. In 1995, Dr. Ramadoss declared that the then DMK president, M.  Karunanidhi, would be the next Chief Minister and presented him with a yellow shawl at Villupuram. Thirty-five years later, his son Dr. Anbumani  will demand the ouster of the DMK and Karunanidhi’s son, M.K. Stalin, from power for their failure to implement the internal reservation for the Vanniyars,” PMK spokesperson K. Balu said.\nAnother senior PMK leader close to Dr. Ramadoss said he hoped Dr. Anbumani would step back. “Who is going to be the biggest loser if the party’s vote share dwindles and voters switch to other parties? It is going to be Dr. Anbumani who is the future of this party,” he said.\nIt is believed that the women’s conference, announced by Dr. Ramadoss  for August 10 at Poompuhar, would help to end the impasse."

The government said there is a “marginal decline” in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men too.\nThe Ministry said the LFPR in current weekly status (CWS) among all persons aged 15 and above was 54.2 % during June this year as compared to 54.8% during May 2025. “The LFPR in rural areas was 56.1% and LFPR in urban areas was 50.4% during June 2025 for persons of the same age group,” the Ministry said. The LFPR for males aged 15 and above in rural and urban areas were respectively 78.1% and 75% during June 2025, and it marked a marginal decline from the corresponding LFPR estimates of 78.3% and 75.1% respectively for rural and urban areas during May 2025.\nFor females, the LFPR for age 15 years and above for rural areas was 35.2% in June 2025. This was 36.9% in May and 38.2% in April. In urban areas, the LFPR for females aged above 15 was 25% in June. It was 25.3% in May. For females of all age groups in both rural and urban areas, the LFPR was 24.5% in June and it was 25.5% in May.\nThe unemployment rate for females and males of all ages above 15 was 5.6%. While for men, the rate remained same as of May, for females there was a decrease in UR by 0.1 percentage point. While the rural unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the urban unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points between May and June.\nThe worker population ratio (WPR) for people of all ages above 15 in both urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 38.7% compared to 39% in May.\nThe Union Government said the marginal decline in LFPR and WPR in June was largely influenced by seasonal agricultural patterns, intense summer heat limiting outdoor physical work, and a shift of some unpaid helpers, particularly from higher-income rural households, towards domestic chores. It said the share of rural female workers in agriculture dropped from 70.2% in May to 69.8% in June, indicating the reduced need for agricultural engagement among women, “perhaps due to a decline in rural inflation”.\nThe Ministry had started releasing monthly figures of employment and unemployment data since April for a better perspective of the situation. “The number of households surveyed was 89,493 (49,335 in rural areas and 40,158 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 3,80,538 (2,17,251 in rural areas and 1,63,287 in urban areas),” the Ministry said."

Mr. Rana has not yet attained the age of 65.\nHowever, Mr. Rana’s counsel, advocate Piyush Sachdeva, submitted that the accused is 64 years and six months old and suffers from medical conditions that warrant special consideration.\nThe NIA informed the court that it has submitted Mr. Rana’s complete medical history to the jail authorities.\nThe matter has been posted for further hearing on July 25.\nExtradited from the United States on April 10, Mr. Rana, 64, is facing trial in connection with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which left more than 166 people dead.\nThe NIA, which is investigating the case, has charged Mr. Rana with conspiring in the attacks along with his associate David Headley. Headley, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, is accused of conducting planning and reconnaissance for the attacks at the behest of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed."

He also favoured reservation in private sector.\n“We must demand political representation and ensure that backward classes will have a proportional voice in all decision-making bodies. Economic opportunities should be expanded through reservation in private sector jobs, government promotions and contracts, financial support and schemes, and access to markets,” he told the delegates at the first meeting of the council here on Tuesday.\n“Awareness campaigns to combat discrimination and ensure social integration, build a strong sense of backward class consciousness, which brings awareness of social reality, strength in numbers and right to equality. This political awakening will fuel aspiration, solidarity and long- term change,” he said, outlining the responsibility for the council, which comprises 24 leaders, including former Chief Ministers, former Ministers and Members of Parliament.\nThe council has been set by the AICC to deliberate and strategise party’s response in the OBC politics across the country and woo back the OBC voters to the party fold.\nMr. Siddaramaiah, a member of the panel, said the Council must become a platform that transforms socio economic and educational caste census from a political debate into constitutional necessity. “It should provide space that ensures backward classes voices shape policy, not just manifestos and a force that mobilises intellectual capital, youth energy and grassroots strength to build leadership emerging from the oppressed classes.” He said the council is not a formality, but “soul of India’s social justice movement... We should remind the country that AHINDA is not a vote bank, but it is the voice of India’s conscience.”\nAttacking the BJP and Sangha Parivar, the Chief Minister said, “They may polarise India through caste division, but we will win back India through social unity and constitutional justice. They treat OBCs as mere symbols, We uplift them as equals.”  At every step, BJP opposed Congress’s social justice efforts not just politically, but ideologically too, undermining equity and resisting OBC empowerment out of discomfort for true backward class advancement, he added.\nAmong those present in the meeting, which will continue its deliberations on Wednesday, were Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanswamy. The council will deliberate on the national caste census, a demand by the Congress and OBC oriented welfare programmes in the country."

He made the appeal during a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday, as part of his two-day visit to the national capital.\nMr. Naidu was accompanied by Union Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, Minister of State for Rural Development Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, TDP Lok Sabha floor leader Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and others.\nThe Chief Minister explained that the project aims to divert 200 tmc ft of surplus floodwaters from the Polavaram reservoir to the Banakacherla regulator in Kurnool district. This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema. Later, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Managing Director Vikas Kumar also called on the Chief Minister and held discussions on possible collaboration for metro rail projects in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada."

    "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) held celebrations in Jammu and Kashmir over the Central Administrative Tribunal’s (CAT) decision to drop Urdu as a mandatory qualification for candidates applying to Naib-Tehsildar posts in the Union Territory.\nA bench of the CAT’s Jammu Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday stayed the operation of provisions in the Jammu and Kashmir Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, which stipulated graduation with knowledge of Urdu as a minimum qualification for the post.\nThe tribunal directed the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) to accept applications from candidates with knowledge of any of the five official languages listed in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the order, the JKSSB on Tuesday deferred the process of inviting applications for the posts.\nUnder the Official Languages Act, 2020, enacted during Central rule, Hindi, Kashmiri, English, Dogri, and Urdu were declared as official languages in Jammu and Kashmir. Prior to the reorganisation of the former State in 2019, Urdu was the sole official language.\nCelebrations were held at Srinagar’s Ghanta Ghar by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, where its president Arun Prabhat welcomed the tribunal’s order. He said the government’s earlier notification to continue with Urdu as a mandatory subject was discriminatory.\n“The notice was anti-Constitution. Our Constitution preamble with Article 14 and 16 are for equal opportunity for all and against any discrimination on the basis of colour, creed or caste. The J&K government notice was discriminatory to four out of five languages declared as official languages here,” Mr. Prabhat said.\nReacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed Ur Rehman Para accused the BJP of politicising the Urdu language and “injecting communal overtones into the discourse around Jammu and Kashmir’s linguistic heritage”.\n“BJP’s attempt to view Urdu through a communal lens marks a dangerous and disgraceful new low in our political discourse in J&K. Urdu is not a symbol of any religion but the throbbing pulse of Jammu & Kashmir’s identity, echoing collective memories and soulful struggles of our people over centuries,” Mr. Para said in a post on social media platform X.\nHe said that Urdu is the language of poets, courts, revenue offices, administration, and everyday life in Jammu and Kashmir. “Even more disturbing is the CAT’s order staying the requirement of basic Urdu knowledge for the Naib Tehsildar exam — a signal that judicial forums too are beginning to cave under political pressure,” he added.\nThe PDP, Mr. Para said, stood for the preservation of the region’s linguistic and cultural identity. “Urdu must be preserved, not just as a language, but as an embodiment of our shared heritage, administrative continuity & cultural essence that binds every region of J&K together.”"

    "content": "Air India will partially resume international flights from August 1, after the “safety pause” necessitated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 fleet following thedeadly crash of AI-171 on June 12. A full restoration of flights across its global network is planned from October 1, the airline said in a press statement.\nThe airline also announced that it will be moving three out of its five weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London’s Gatwick airport to the British capital’s Heathrow airport instead, for a period of two months from August 1.\nBetween July 16 and August 1, the airline will restore seven flights to destinations such as London, Zurich, Tokyo, and Seoul. During the same period, the airline will operate 13 fewer flights to European destinations as compared to its full schedule, and 20 fewer flights to the U.S. and Canada. Destinations in Australia will continue to see four fewer flights. Some services to London and Singapore will remain suspended till September 30.\nThe DGCA had ordered enhanced checks for Air India’s 33 Boeing 787 aircraft, which had led to long delays and cancellations of flights, inviting flak from passengers.\nFollowing the DGCA’s intervention, Air India announced it was curtailing 15% of its internatIonal flights due to disruptions caused due to a combination of factors, including airspace closures over Pakistan and the Middle East. The cut was announced for a period of a month, and later extended until the end of July.\nTuesday’s (July 15, 2025) announcement also follows last week’s interim probe report into the June 12 crash that killed 260 people. The report did not recommend any extra measures for either the aircraft type or its engines.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson told airline employees on an internal platform that all Boeing 787s had been checked since the crash, and were found “fit-to-fly”. Since the interim report found that the lock on the switches that supply fuel to the two engines had moved or “transitioned” before both engines shut down, the airline has also started inspecting the lock feature for the fuel control switches. This exercise has been carried out for 50% of Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet.\nOn Monday (July 14, 2025), the DGCA ordered all airlines with Boeing aircraft to carry out this inspection by July 21."
