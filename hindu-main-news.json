    "content": "Traffic jams have become a daily occurrence on the Masab Tank flyover due to the ongoing repair and restoration works. During peak hours, the stream of vehicles could be seen stuck from the flyover up to the PVNR Expressway staring at Mehdipatnam.\nBesides, commuters, who have no inkling of the works, are horrified at the bumpy rides and loud noise while travelling on the flyover.\nThe Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has chosen to carry out the repair works during night in order not to disturb the traffic flow during the day.\nAs per information gathered from the Engineering wing officials, the repairs have been taken up to replace the strip seal joints, in order to arrest water leakage, and damage of the road at joints.\nWork for repairs and restoration of age old flyovers in the city is being taken up by GHMC for some time. Already, the flyovers at Lalapet and Jamia Osmania railway station had been restored, after prolonged repair works which took well over six months. In both cases, traffic was completely stopped on the side of the road where repairs were being taken up.\nHowever, in case of the Masab Tank flyover, it was not possible, officials said, because even with the flyover in place, the traffic crawls irrespective of the time of the day. Without the flyover, it would be mayhem.\n“Repairs are being carried out  at night, while the portion under repair is covered up using iron sheets during the day time to facilitate traffic,” an official shared.\nTenders for the strip seal joint restoration were called during January-February this year, and reportedly finalised with an estimated cost of ₹48 lakh.\nMasab Tank flyover is 24 years old, and one among the first generation flyovers in the city along with the ones built at Narayanguda, Basheerbagh, and Tarnaka.\nWhile the average running age of a flyover is around 30-40 years, this structure has started crumbling even before it could complete 25 years, forcing the authorities to expedite the repair works. In comparison, for Khairatabad flyover, which was built in 1986, no repair works have been taken up so far despite vehicles experiencing bumpy rides.\nMaintenance wing officials have issued an internal circular with instructions for review of all the old flyovers in the city to assess the structural stability, and take up repair works wherever the intended load carrying capacity was not matching.\nOfficials said twenty-four flyovers have been chosen for the assessment, which include those at Khairatabad, Basheerbagh, Narayanguda, Secunderabad, Punjagutta, Begumpet, Tarnaka, Fatehnagar, Nalgonda Crossroads, Moosapet, Seetaphalmandi, Greenlands, Secretariat, and others.\nInspections need to be conducted, and based on the reports, maintenance operations may be taken up such as replacement of expansion joints and distressed bearings, treatment of damaged girders and cracked sections, grouting, RCC repairs, and application of anti-carbonation paint to protect exposed surfaces."

The first phase will be wrapped up in Chengalpattu on August 23.\nSources in the party said that former general secretary and party founder Vijayakant, had undertaken a similar tour in 2017 to appraise the actual strength of the party at the grassroots.\n“It has been a while since the leader of the party met the party cadre. Our general secretary will meet the people and the party workers to understand their point of view. The party cadre will feel energised by this tour,” said former MLA and DMDK’s deputy general secretary B. Parthasarathy.\nFurthermore, sources added that the exercise was necessary as it would reveal the extent to which the party’s support base has got eroded and help towards restoring it.\nMs. Premallatha’s decision to meet the party workers and enthuse them was to prepare for the grand public rally planned in Cuddalore on January 9.\nWith DMDK believed to be keeping their options open, Ms. Premallatha has said that they would make their position clear on the alliance in the public rally on January 9, even after the AIADMK allotted a Rajya Sabha seat to it and announced that the alliance between both the parties would continue.\nMs. Premallatha’s son V. Vijaya Prabhakaran, who has been promoted as the young face of the party recently and appointed as Youth Wing Secretary, is also expected to accompany her in the tour after narrowly losing the Virudhunagar Parliamentary constituency in 2024 Lok Sabha election."

    "content": "The recent deaths of three young girls following rabies, in separate incidents in Pathanamthitta, Malappuram and Kollam, in spite of post-exposure prophylaxis with anti-rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, have yet again brought attention to the need to protect children with pre-exposure prophylaxis vaccination.\nPre-exposure prophylaxis for children in a highly rabies-endemic State like Kerala, where the number of human rabies deaths have been increasing, was a strategy recommended as a short-term priority—to be achieved in 1.5 years—by the B. Ekbal committee that framed the State Vaccine Policy in November 2022.\nThe detailed field investigation into the recent rabies deaths of children by the Health department, in association with the National Centre for Disease Control, Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation, the State Public Health Lab and the district surveillance units, had looked into all aspects of the case, including the nature of animal bite, the timeliness of interventions, adherence to standard protocols, vaccine cold chain, techniques of vaccine administration, training for staff and public awareness of prophylaxis .\nThe report, which was submitted by the Director of Health Services to the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights last week following a petition filed by advocate Kulathoor Jaising points out that all three children had sustained severe, deep Category 3 dog bites in highly innervated areas as the head, neck and upper limb, resulting in direct inoculation of the virus into the nerves, thus rendering the administered immunoglobulin and vaccine ineffective\nIn one case, the child had been bitten by the neighbour’s  pet dog and despite taking vaccine and immunoglobulin, she had developed rabies symptoms three months later. In two other cases, there were delays in care seeking, but which was likely due to the distance to the health facility, non-availability of rabies immunoglobulin at the taluk hospital or public health centre and lack of awareness about the importance of wound washing.\n“Because of their small size, children fall down when a rabid dog attacks them, making them vulnerable to repeated bites, which are invariably  Category 3 bites (face, head, neck or hand where there is a concentration of nerve fibres). When the wounds are deep, more nerve fibres are exposed and the virus enters the nervous system directly,” public health experts point out.\nThere could be unanticipated delays in getting proper treatment. But if a child has been given pre-exposure prophylaxis, rabies antibodies are already there in the body to fight the virus, if he/she sustains an animal bite later. A child who has been given pre-exposure prophylaxis will not need rabies immunoglobulin after an animal bite and even the post-exposure vaccination can be contained to two doses.\nThe report submitted by the DHS makes it clear that people dying despite taking post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination is a regular occurrence in the State."

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has ordered the Excise Department officials to stop the sale of liquor brands that found their way into the market through dubious channels and to ensure that only national and international quality brands are available to the consumers.\nNoting that the market was flooded with fake liquor brands, which posed grave health hazards during the YSR Congress Party’s (YSRCP) tenure, the Chief Minister also wanted the officials to crack down on the sales of non-duty paid liquor or illicit brews.\nAddressing a review meeting on the Excise Department on Monday, Mr. Naidu said that the fake liquor brands caused a huge dent to the public exchequer, besides spoiling the health of lakhs of consumers.\n“The new liquor policy being implemented by the NDA government has given a boost to revenues, which used to flow into the neighbouring States during the YSRCP’s tenure. The liquor brands that used to be made in distilleries that belonged to the YSRCP leaders have vanished now,” Mr. Naidu said.\nThe Officials informed the Chief Minister that ‘anonymous liquor brands’ were no longer available and that all the leading brands are being sold now. Up to 68% of the liquor in the market consisted of unbranded products previously.\nMr. Naidu said that liquor prices had fallen for the first time in the history of the Excise Department after the NDA government assumned the office.\nThe officials said that prices had been reduced by ₹10 to ₹100, depending on the brand and that the prices of the top 30 liquor brands in the State were lowered when compared to the prices in the neighbouring States of Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\nMr. Naidu instructed the officials to take a decision on allowing permit rooms after the committee constituted by the government submitted its recommendation. The officials pointed out that the lack of permit rooms was encouraging people to consume liquor in public places, which was affecting the law and order.\nHe asked the officials to permit setting up microbreweries at tourist places to encourage tourism, and to do real-time tracking of vehicle movements from distilleries to the Andhra Pradesh Beverages Corporation and from there to retail stores, by using modern technologies.\nEvery vehicle transporting liquor stock should be equipped with GPS devices, he added.\nBesides, the Chief Minister called for the promotion of digital payments and stressed the need for tighter vigil aimed at curbing the menace of belt shops.\nExcise Department Principal Secretary Mukesh Kumar Meena and other senior officials took part in the review meeting."

It is the AIADMK-led front that will win 210 seats and form the next government in the State after the 2026 poll.”\nReferring to the Tamil Nadu government appointing four senior bureaucrats as its official spokespersons to disseminate information on government schemes and initiatives to the public, Mr. Palaniswami said this was an attempt to hoodwink the people. “If these officers indulged in dissemination of information on schemes of the DMK government, who would take care of their usual administrative duties?” he asked.\nNormally, this should be done by the Directorate of Information and Public Relations, which was headed by a Minister. He appealed to the four bureaucrats to furnish only the truth. If the officers indulged in spreading wrong information or misinformation to please the powers that be, they would be answerable after the AIADMK comes to power in 2026, he said.\nMr. Palaniswami also accused the the DMK of neglecting farmers and not fulfilling many of its assurances for the farm sector in the last four years. The government had not fulfilled its assurances of procuring sugar cane at ₹4,000 a tonne and paddy at ₹2,500 a quintal.\nHe said representatives of farmers’ associations had submitted a petition to him earlier in the day complaining the Perumal tank was not properly desilted. Alleging only a portion of the Perumal tank in the district was desilted, he said a probe would be ordered after the AIADMK comes to power."

    "content": "CPI(M) Politburo member B.V. Raghavulu on Monday alleged that the Election Commission of India (ECI) facilitated a backdoor citizenship registration process under the guise of voter enrolment in Bihar and sent letters to other States to replicate it even as the Supreme Court was looking into the matter.\nAddressing the media here on Monday (July 14), Mr. Raghavulu said that the Special Identification Register (SIR) in Bihar was not supposed to ascertain the citizenship of people. He further alleged that the SIR process was clearly biased towards the BJP as the ECI pushed for a Bihar-style SIR in other States even before the apex court hearing on July 28.\nMr. Raghavulu also alleged that the Indian government yielded to pressure mounted by the U.S. government during the tariff negotiations. The tariffs which were likely to be in the 23%–25% range, despite the claims of a tough stand by the Indian government, would cause grave injustice to the farmers.\nImport of Genetically Modified (GM) wheat, corn, soy, and dairy products would harm 80 million dairy farmers in the country. The government kept quiet when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on steel, and high tariffs on some other items/commodities, he added.\nMr. Raghavulu alleged that the government made secret deals for purchase of Boeing aircraft, helicopters, and nuclear reactors from the U.S.\nReacting to A.P. Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan’s comments on Hindi language, Mr. Raghavulu said that all languages were equal under the Constitution, and Hindi should not be imposed on someone. Mr. Kalyan is submissive to the BJP in this regard and his stand thereof is contradictory with the line taken by him earlier, the CPI(M) leader added."

Chandrababu Naidu approved the proposal to promote associate professors with one year of teaching experience, instead of the usual three years, to the rank of professor in government medical colleges.\n\nThe decision to fill the posts in both new and existing government medical colleges, a step considered vital for securing National Medical Commission (NMC) approval —mandatory for opening admissions in newly established government colleges for the academic year 2025–26.\nCurrently, professor posts vacancies are in the new medical colleges at Vizianagaram, Paderu, Rajamahendravaram, Eluru, Machilipatnam and Nandyal.\nMinister for Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare Satya Kumar Yadav has directed that the proposals to recruit professors and associate professors on a contract basis be deferred for now. He added that once promotions, in the above-mentioned manner, are completed, recruitment on a contract basis would be taken up as per requirement.\nIt may be noted that the contractual basis of recruitment has met with strong opposition from government healthcare professionals.\nIn a letter to the Health Minister on Sunday, A.P. Government Doctors’ Association have urged him to reconsider the decision to recruit professors on a contract basis. They say that the government is taking away the promotion opportunity of senior doctors, who have been waiting for a long time."

The YSRCP government created unauthorised posts in the State FiberNet Limited to accommodate its party workers, which resulted in the workforce increasing steeply to 1,350 and misuse of public funds.\nMr. Naidu ordered that a thorough investigation should be done into those appointments and steps taken to rectify the past mistakes. He told the officials to increase the present 4,53,525 connections to at least 8 to 10 lakh.\nThe Chief Minister approved the integration of AP FiberNet with BharatNet (the amended BharatNet programme), under which the Central government would provide ₹1,900 crore to AP FiberNet from 2025 to 2035. He gave the nod for transition of fiber networks in 1,692 gram panchayats (GPs) across Chittoor and Visakhapatnam districts from linear to ring architecture, and connecting an additional 480 new GPs using the ring model.\nMr. Naidu also proposed the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle jointly managed by the Central and State governments to oversee the FiberNet projects. Further, the Chief Minister emphasised the need to reintroduce services like virtual classrooms and strengthen the fiber network in rural and underserved areas and resolving pending issues with the local cable operators."

Therefore, 88.18% of electors have either already submitted their enumeration form or died or retained their names at one place or permanently shifted out of their previous place of residence.\nAs a result, only 11.82% of electors now remain to submit their filled-in enumeration forms and many of them have sought time to submit these documents in the coming days, the EC said in an official statement.\nThe last date of submission of the filled enumeration forms is on July 25.\nThe poll body said nearly one lakh Booth Level Officers (BLO) will soon begin their third round of door-to-door visits. Their efforts are being augmented by the 1.5 lakh Booth Level Agents (BLA) appointed by all political parties, each one of whom can certify and submit up to 50 enumeration forms per day.\nTo ensure that no eligible urban voter is left out of the voters’ list, special camps are also being set up in all the 5,683 wards of all 261 urban local bodies (ULBs) of Bihar.\nFor the electors who may have temporarily migrated out of the State, focused efforts through newspaper advertisements and direct contact with such electors are being made to ensure that they are able to fill their enumeration forms well in time and have their names also included in the draft forms to be published on August 1. Such electors can easily fill up the forms online using their mobile phones through the ECINet app or through the online form on the EC’s website.\nThey can also send their forms to the concerned BLOs through their family members or through any online means, including WhatsApp or similar applications, the statement said."

The entire solution would be designed as an open-source platform, allowing other Indian cities to implement similar traffic management systems, he added.\nHowever, he said, the project’s success would depend on collaboration with the BTP and the BBMP.\nMr. Pitti also requested public support by encouraging citizens to connect with traffic authorities, inviting AI professionals to contribute their expertise, and rallying commuters to advocate for the initiative, emphasising that India’s technology capital deserved world-class infrastructure for its innovators and workforce."

    "content": "The Ministry of Environment and Forests said in a note on Monday (July 14, 2025) that its recent decision to exempt a majorityof thermal power plants from installing flue gas desulphurisation (FGD)units was a “scientifically justified shift towards more targeted, cost-effective and climate-coherent regulation” and not a rollback of environmental safeguards.\nFGD units are used to cut sulphur dioxide emissions from coal plants and in 2015, the Ministry had made the systems mandatory for all thermal plants. However, only 8% of India’s roughly 180 coal plants have done so. The other plants have received multiple extensions from the Ministry for reasons such as limited availability of these units and high cost. The latest order, however, says only a minority of plants – 22% -- located in major cities with a history of poor air quality need to install these units.\nThe revised policy, its note says, reflects India’s “...declining ambient sulphur dioxide levels, the limited role of sulphur dioxide levels in driving PM2.5 health impacts and... the disproportionate resource and environmental costs of indiscriminate FGD mandates”. The Ministry’s note was in response to “media reports”.\nAccording to the Ministry, India’s annual sulphur dioxide concentration standard of 50 microgram/cubic metre is more stringent than Japan (66), European Union (52.4) and Australia (66). A 2023 measurement in 492 cities, the Ministry said, found that all but two -- Dehradun and Kolar – were compliant. Indian coal was naturally low in sulphur (0.5% of weight) but had high ash content and therefore led to low sulphur dioxide concentrations. Studies had shown that cities with thermal power plants that have FGD technology and those without FGD technology didn’t show any “significant difference” in sulphur dioxide concentrations, it said. “Eliminating all sulphur dioxide emissions would only result in a marginal improvement of particulate matter concentrations... At ₹1.2 crore per MW [megawatt], the capital expense of installing FGD would be ₹2.54 lakh crore and would only bring about a marginal benefit,” it said.\nUnder new rules, only about 11% of India’s 600 thermal power units – a single plant can have multiple units – have to mandatorily install FGD systems. These plants, called ‘Category A’ units, are located within a 10-km radius of the National Capital Region or cities with a population of at least one million (2011 Census). Originally, these plants were to have FGD systems in place by 2017 but have been given multiple extensions. The latest – as per a gazette notification this week – is December 30, 2027.\nAnother 11% of units, falling under Category B, located within 10-km radius of Critically Polluted Areas (CPAs) or Non-Attainment Cities (NACs) may or may not have to install FGD systems. This would depend upon a decision by an Expert Appraisal Committee, an existing body constituted by the Ministry to decide on according environment clearance to proposed coal plant projects. Those that must install FGD systems have a deadline of December 30, 2028.\nCPAs are regions or industrial clusters that are extremely polluted and deemed so according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) criteria. NACs are those that have the worst air quality and haven’t met National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for at least five years, and there are 131 of these.\nThe remaining ‘Category C’ thermal power plants, or 78% of the total plants, are now exempt from installing FGD systems."

Hemaraj and sentenced him to undergo rigorous life imprisonment for pushing a pregnant woman off a moving train near Katpadi when she resisted a sexual assault attempt in February.\nJudge S. Meenakumari delivered the verdict, sentencing Hemaraj to undergo rigorous life imprisonment besides imposing a fine of ₹85,000. The Judge also directed the Ministry of Railways and the State government to pay a compensation of ₹50 lakh each to the survivor.\nThe compensation should be deposited within a month. The court, in its ruling, also said that all future medical expenses of the survivor, if required, should be fully borne by the State government. “A total of 22 witnesses, including the survivor were examined for the case. All charges filed against Hemaraj have been proved,” Public Prosecutor (PP) P.T. Saravanan toldThe Hindu.\nPolice said that on February 6, a 36-year-old pregnant woman was pushed off a moving train near Katpadi in Vellore, when she resisted an attempt of Hemaraj, 27, to sexually assault her. He was arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP), Jolarpet, in connection with the incident.\nThe police said the woman, who was four months pregnant, had been living with her family in Tiruppur. Owing to her pregnancy, she was travelling to her mother’s house and boarded the Coimbatore-Tirupati Intercity Express alone on the said day.\nThe police said the accused person, Hemaraj, of Pooncholai near K.V. Kuppam in Vellore, boarded the ladies compartment of the train at Jolarpet. As she was alone in the compartment, he attempted to sexually assault her, she said. When she resisted his attempt, Hemaraj allegedly fractured her right hand and pushed her towards the entrance. Though she held onto the handle, she fell down after losing her grip and became unconscious.\nThe police said the incident occurred at around 11.30 a.m. near the K.V. Kuppam station. A few railway workers rescued the woman, who was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital in Vellore.\nThe police said the accused was freed on conditional bail a few months ago in a case of murder of a 29-year-old woman from Chennai in April 2024. He is also facing another case, registered by the GRP, Jolarpet, in 2022 for pushing a woman commuter off a moving train after snatching her mobile phone. He was also charged under the Goondas Act twice."

Once merged, residents of the settlements will be able to access welfare schemes through their respective gram panchayats as per existing norms, significantly improving their access to public services, officials said.\nWhile the SSPA will retain ownership of unallocated plots in the settlements, all relevant records will be transferred to the gram panchayats. Additionally, schools, anganwadis, and health centres in the settlements will be handed over to the relevant departments, the government said.\nVoting rights and representation of settlement residents will be ensured in accordance with the existing government provisions. “The gram panchayats will also be empowered to assess properties and collect applicable taxes and levies under the Gujarat Panchayats Act, 1993,” they said\nThe government has clarified that these rules will serve as the standard for future integration of the remaining SSPA settlements. A formal resolution to this effect has been issued by the Department of Panchayat, Rural Housing and Rural Development under the guidance of Mr. Patel."

    "content": "Nearly four years afterintroducing digital attendance systemfor Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers and three years after making it mandatory, the government has discovered a whole range of ways the National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS) platform used for the purpose is being “misused” and has now added four layers of analog monitoring to plug the holes.\nOn July 8, 2025, the Union Rural Development Ministry issued a 13-page note to the State governments on the issue.\nAs per the Ministry’s note, there were at least seven ways that the NMMS is allegedly being gamed, which, the government said, was undermining the credibility of the digital attendance system and leading to “potential misuse of public funds”. The Ministry also cautioned that “no relaxation will be given in matters concerning the misuse or manipulation of NMMS”.\nUnder NMMS, geo-tagged photographs of the workers are to be uploaded twice a day. First when they arrive for work and then at the end of their shift. Only exception for the second round of photographing is offered at sites with 20 or below workers. It was found that “irrelevant or unrelated photographs” were being uploaded. In many cases, “photo-to-photo capturing instead of live work images” was being done.\nThere was also “mismatch in actual vs recorded count”. A mismatch in gender composition of workers was found at several work sites. The same photo of workers in multiple muster rolls, mismatch in workers in morning and afternoon photos and non-uploading of photos in the afternoon session are the other discrepancies flagged by the Rural Development Ministry.\nThe Ministry has directed the States to ensure that these photographs and attendance of workers is verified at gram panchayat, block, district and State level. At gram panchayat level, they want 100% verification of the present workers. The percentage of physical verification of the uploaded photographs of workers reducing at different levels. So, while at the block level, 20% of the photos at random need to be verified, at the district level, this number is down to 10%, and at State level to 5%.\nThe other significant change is that the government now allows for editing the muster rolls before making the wage bill. So far, this could be done only at the District Collector’s level, who also took action in case of complaints. Such amendments of the muster rolls were rare.\nChakradhar Buddha, senior researcher, LibTech India, said that what was meant to be a technology-driven, corruption-resistant system is now entirely dependent on manual checks by frontline workers. “This defeats the very purpose of introducing a digital attendance system,” he added. The government’s directions, he said, will be difficult to comply. “During the summer months, especially in Adivasi areas where large-scale MGNREGA work takes place, thousands of NMMS photos are generated daily. Verifying these images demands staff capacity and technical infrastructure that simply don’t exist on the ground,” Mr. Buddha said."

The meeting decided to inform this in writing to the government.\nKGMCTA pointed out that the government was yet to give a favourable response regarding the anomalies in the pay revision of MCH doctors. Also, the pay revision arrears of the faculty from 2016 to 2020 remains unpaid. Also, the pay of doctors at the entry-level cadre, which got slashed remains an unresolved issue. It also resolved to intervene for the immediate resolution of delays related to the 2025 general transfer process.\nThe meeting demanded that the doctors, who were redeployed to Wayanad and Kasaragod, to secure the approval of the National Medical Commission for the new MCHs, be brought back.\nUnless the government creates sufficient faculty and non-faculty posts in these institutions and fill them, the functioning of other MCHs are also going to be affected, KGMCTA pointed out.\nThe CEC decided to inform the government formally that no new MCHs be started without first creating adequate human resources.\nKGMCTA State president Dr. Rosenara Beegum presided over the meeting."

The Devanahalli struggle has given an organised form to the growing dissatisfaction and anger against the Congress. There are valid reasons for this public outrage to grow,” they said.\nThey alleged that many civil society organisations that had backed the Congress during the Assembly elections in 2023 were now on a different side.\nPouring out their ire at the Congress government, they accused it of continuing to implement many the “anti-farmer” legislations that they had opposed when in the opposition, such as Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act (KPSPCA), 2020, among others. It also did not take a decision against the four labour codes introduced by the central government and it even tried to implement the anti-labour decision to increase working hours from 8 to 12 hours a day, they alleged.\nThey accused the government of failure to protect women and minorities. “Even after two years in power, it has not repealed the anti-conversion law introduced by the BJP. Even though the marginalised communities were yearning for internal reservation and caste census, it did not take a bold stance,” they said in a release.\nThe open letter to Mr. Kharge and Mr. Rahul Gandhi was written by Samyukta Horata – Karnataka that comprises a host of progressive organisations."

    "content": "Australia’s public policy makers are catching up with the rapid changes in India-Australia relationship and in that context, it is necessary to invest in building on think tank resources between the two sides, said Herve Lemahieu, Director of Research of Sydney-based Lowy Institute. The remarks from Mr Lemahieu came in the wake of Australia announcing ‘Maitri Grants’ that will, among other activities, fund the recruitment of a distinguished scholar for the India Chair at the Lowy Institute that is known for high quality research in the field of international studies from the Australian point of view.\n“Australia’s public and policy debates are playing catch-up on the rapid evolution of the bilateral partnership. But think tanks also need to do a better job of situating India within a broader regional and international context. The country will be a central player through the chop and change we are experiencing in global politics,” said Mr Lemahieu.\nThe India Chair will be a new initiative to further promote understanding about India in Australia with the aim to furthering bilateral partnership. Herve Lemahieu described India as “an anchor for strategic balance for Australia and the broader Indo-Pacific region”, adding that “Understanding India, its trajectory, power and diffuse interests, has never been more important to us.”\n“This world-class program of research at the Lowy Institute will do just that. It will elevate India in terms of our research agenda. It’s an opportunity to bring in new talent, fresh perspectives, and deepen the bench on a vital piece of the puzzle in terms of how Australia looks and engages the region,” said Mr Lemahieu. Australia and India are partners in the Quad grouping that also includes Japan and the United States and that apart, the two countries have a history of cooperation that dates back to the immediate post-independence years of India. The two sides are closely working on issues in the Indo-Pacific region as well as the ASEAN grouping where the Myanmar crisis has prompted concern from New Delhi and Canberra.\nOther projects under the Maitri Grants will include an exhibition of paintings by Raja Ravi Varma, an annual leadership dialogue, and innovative research infields like clean energy solutions and biomanufacturing, said a press note from the Centre for Australia India Relations. High Commissioner of Australia Philip Green praised the initiative at the Lowy Institute and said, “An India Chair at the Lowy Institute will contribute to Australians’ understanding of India at a deep level. We are very different societies, and research, scholarship and analysis will allow us to maximize the opportunity of our shared interests.”"

The application allows the court to expedite the trial by convicting the accused based on their plea without a full trial. However, the NIA is preparing to submit its version on the application.\nThe accused in their application told the court that it was voluntary and without any coercion, and sought to reduce the quantum of sentence .\nIn July 2023, the CCB raided a house in Kodigehalli and recovered seven country-made pistols, 45 live rounds of ammunition, walkie-talkies and some documents. Further investigations led the police to believe that radicalisation happened inside the Bengaluru prison.\nThe NIA has accused Naseer of radicalising the youths lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison in Bengaluru. Naseer is an undertrial in the 2008 Bengaluru serial blasts case and was convicted in a terrorism case in Kerala and linked the LeT.\nLast year, the NIA chargesheeted eight people, including T.

Who is the L-G protecting? Where is the accountability?” Congress’ media and publicity head Pawan Khera asked in a post on X.\nHis party colleague and Lok Sabha member from Tamil Nadu, Manickam Tagore, questioned the timing of Mr. Sinha’s statement and bluntly apportioned the blame on the Centre.\n“Before six days to Parliament session, Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha calls the Pahalgam terror attack a ‘security lapse’ and takes ‘full responsibility’. But in J&K, the real control lies with the Union Home Ministry under Amit Shah. Why is he silent after 90 terror-related deaths this year?” Mr. Tagore asked.\nThe Lok Sabha member said the Narendra Modi government promised a “new era of peace” in Kashmir after abrogating Article 370 but 90 people died due to terrorist attacks this year alone.\n“The L-G admits the Pahalgam attack was Pakistan-backed, targeted tourists, and happened in a high-security zone. Then how did terrorists breach security so easily? Who was in charge of intel and preparedness? Answer: Amit Shah’s Home Ministry. If the Union Govt. claims credit for all development in J&K…It must also own the failures of security. You can’t take the photo-ops and dodge the bloodshed. 90 dead in a year is not normal,” Mr. Tagore said on X.\n“Let’s be clear: This is not just a local failure. It’s a central failure — by the Modi govt. and the Home Ministry. The people of Jammu & Kashmir — and India — deserve answers, not slogans,” he added."

Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the Council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration, minister explained.\nNurses from within and outside the State were forced to spend thousands of rupees on food and accommodation solely for registration purposes. They also had to wait in long queues at the Bengaluru office. Many women, pregnant women and new mothers faced considerable inconvenience. Dr. Patil said that the implementation of this new technology puts an end to all these issues.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the Karnataka Nursing Council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PUC marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board, examination results will be directly accessed by the Nursing Council. Later, through DigiLocker-Issuer, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses."

There is no provision for buses, autos, or two-wheelers. It is nothing but corruption under a new name,” he alleged.\nMr. Surya criticised the Congress government for failing to complete key infrastructure projects, pointing out that over 20 flyovers have remained unfinished for years, even as the Deputy Chief Minister announces 100 km of new ones.\nHe also raised concerns about the suburban railway network, saying the original plan to complete 148 km by 2031 is now in limbo, with the four-corridor project stalled. “Every rupee of public money must be protected.

    "content": "The Congress on Monday seemed to struggle to put behind party veteran P.J. Kurien’s seemingly discomfiting criticism that the Youth Congress (YC) lacked boots on the ground when compared to its main political rivals, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-affiliated Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the Students Federation of India (SFI).\nA section of Congress leaders reportedly felt that Mr. Kurien had inadvertently played into the SFI-DYFI narrative that the Youth Congress leadership led an ivory tower existence far removed from the travails of ordinary people and seemed mono-maniacally fixated on creating “self-promotional” social media content instead of championing public causes.\nMr. Kurien’s alleged attempt to “single out Chandy Oommen, MLA, as a laudable exception of youth leadership,” given the latter’s “ubiquitous grassroots level presence in the community”, also reportedly came under criticism from within the Congress, given its supposed “potential to spur personality clashes and ego conflicts” among young leaders.\nDisconcertingly for the party leadership, Mr. Kurien unapologetically reiterated his position on Monday. “I do not see any young Congress leaders in my constituency,” he told reporters in Kottayam.\nThe supposed disgruntlement with Mr. Kurien among a section of the party’s leadership seemed reflected in Congress veteran K.C. Joseph’s words on social media.\nHe said Mr. Kurien’s “praise” for SFI-DYFI belied the YC-KSU’s relentless struggles against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s wrongdoings. “Nobody needs to praise them. But at least, they can refrain from setting the hounds on them,” Mr. Joseph wrote.\nLeader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan defended the Youth Congress and the KSU by stating that Congress had an enviable young leadership. “Youth Congress and KSU workers suffered police excesses and endured long spells of incarceration for standing up for people’s causes. Some quarters are irked by their covetable public acceptance,” he said.\nHowever, Mr. Kurien appeared to find some support among a section of senior Congress leaders. For one, Ramesh Chennithala stated that Mr. Kurien’s words were wise counsel and the party should take them in the correct spirit."

Habitat mapping, public awareness campaigns, gear modification, demarcation of conserved areas, AI-supported shark recognition devices, and an identification manual were proposed at the workshop.\nShark fins in frozen form may often be difficult to identify by enforcement agencies, requiring the need for a strengthened collective capacity among all agencies involved in fisheries management, trade regulation, biodiversity conservation, and enforcement, the release said.\nInaugurating the workshop, Shaik Khader Rahman, Chief Commissioner, CGST & Customs, said that joint training exercises and a real-time communication channel among Customs, Fisheries officers, Coastal police, researchers, and Forest and Wildlife departments were essential for effective enforcement. There is a need to forge lasting understanding and actionable strategies between conservation and enforcement, he added."

Outsiders were also staying in campus hostels, the letter said.\nThe varsity authorities sought protection for officials, besides requesting the help of the police for implementing the decision to bar entry into the campus and hostels after 11 p.m.\nThe letter pointed out that the recommendations made by a sub-committee of the Syndicate to ensure discipline and make the campus drug-free came into effect from July 1. However, three amendments were made to the regulations in view of the strike by a section of students and following discussions involving teaching and non-teaching staff.\nA Syndicate meeting on July 7 had decided to set up hostel monitoring and discipline committees as part of implementing disciplinary rules to make the campus drug-free and ensure the safety of students."

These operations were conducted under the leadership of Michael Jerald, Additional Director of Income Tax (Investigation), Madurai, with the support of officers from Tiruchi, Madurai and Tirunelveli.\nThe department initiated inquiries under various provisions of the Income Tax Act into the fraudulent claims of tax deductions that were falsely declared in order to obtain undue tax refunds.  Preliminary findings revealed that several tax professionals and intermediaries across Tamil Nadu had been facilitating thousands of taxpayers to file fake refund claims by submitting fabricated details in their tax returns.  As a result,  widespread searches and inquiries were being conducted across south Tamil Nadu.\nThe fraudulent claims predominantly involved claiming fake deductions under various sections such as Section 80GGC (donations to political parties), Section 80D (Medical insurance premiums), Section 80 C (Tuition fees) and Section 10 (13 A) House Rent Allowance along with other deduction clauses, a press release from the Income Department said here on Monday.\nThrough these deceitful methods, tax payers were assisted in falsely enhancing their tax deductions enabling them to claim illegitimate refunds.  The fraudulent refund amount is estimated to be approximately ₹500 crore.\nInvestigations have unearthed that dedicated email IDs were created specifically by these agents to file fraudulent tax returns on behalf of taxpayers. Thousands of returns were filed through these email IDs resulting in crores of rupees being refunded wrongfully. During the course of the search operations, incriminating evidence had been recovered and seized.\nThe Income Tax department continues to conduct investigations across all its offices. Taxpayers had been cautioned to remain vigilant and refrain from engaging in such unethical and illegal practices that not only cause revenue loss to the government but expose them to penal consequences.\nAll taxpayers who may have filed incorrect or fraudulent tax returns during the current or previous financial years had been advised to voluntarily come forward and file revised or updated returns. This would not only help in building trust between the taxpayers and the department but also help them avoid penalties, legal proceedings, and prosecution, the release added."

Instead of repeatedly pointing out “fight for CM’s chair”, which is the party’s internal matter, let them point out if any there is any mistake in governance, he said.\nHe said that after Operation Sindoor was called off, American President Donald Trump repeatedly stated that he had stopped the war and disgraced India. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trips to various nations to befriend them, 183 nations out of 193 sided with Pakistan. And Mr. Modi was forced to send Congress leader Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation to other nations to present India’s stand, Mr. Lad said, seeking to know why the Opposition is not raising questions over such issues.\nThe Minister said that around two crore children had dropped out of schools across the country, and in Maharashtra, over 800 women had gotten their wombs removed to get work during their menstruation period. “Should we not raise such issues? If we bring all these issues to debate, they will be in an embarrassing position. So to divert the attention, they (BJP) keep talking about our internal matter,” he said.\nMr. Lad said that as per the RBI statement, ₹1.14 thousand crore of fake currency and ₹2,000 currency notes that were withdrawn were still in circulation. “What steps has that Union government taken in this regard? They can criticise anyone on Earth, but we should not raise questions over real issues and seek answers from the Prime Minister. After all he is the Prime Minister of the country.

Revanth Reddy along with his Cabinet colleagues launching it in Tungaturthy in Suryapet district.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Reddy said his government is determined to restore the self-respect of the poor through schemes like ration cards, farmers’ insurance and loan waivers. He said 5.6 lakh new ration cards are sanctioned, 26 lakh people were added to the ration system and 3.10 crore people were receiving fine rice. He also promised to bring Godavari waters to the Tungaturthy through Devdula project.\nFood and Civil Supplies Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy called the move a ‘revolution in public service delivery’ and every eligible person would now be guaranteed a ration card. He said the BRS regime had denied lakhs of poor families their right to food, not only by refusing to issue new ration cards but also by blocking updates like the addition or deletion of family members, causing severe hardships for growing households.\nThe launch marked the first large-scale ration card distribution in over 11 years, taking the total number of ration card holders to 95.56 lakh households, covering more than 3.09 crore beneficiaries, he said.\nMr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the ration card drive was part of a broader transformation that had made Telangana the first State in the world to provide 6 kg of fine rice per person to 80% of its population, entirely free of cost.\nThe Minister said the scheme represented true welfare, inspired by the vision of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, under whose leadership the UPA government had passed the National Food Security Act.\nMr. Uttam Kumar Reddy revealed that the Telangana government was now spending ₹13,000 crore annually to procure and distribute fine rice. No other State offers this level of quality grain free of cost.\nHe also blamed the BRS government stating the Civil Supplies Corporation was crippled with ₹59,000 crore in liabilities and ₹11,000 crore in accumulated losses. The Congress government had not only revived the department but turned it into the engine of India’s most ambitious welfare programme."

Ismail claimed that corruption was rampant there. Along with patients and their caregivers, the hospital staff also were affected by the crisis plaguing the hospital, they said. Back-to-back fire outbreaks, shortage of doctors and nurses, and scarcity of drugs were some of the major issues. They demanded that the government take immediate steps to address the problems.\nMr. Razak and Mr. Ismail alleged that there had been two fire outbreaks at the block housing the casualty section that had been constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) using ₹195 crore of Central funds. There had been lapses in the construction of the building. The investigation into these incidents, however, was an attempt to deceive the people, they alleged.\nThey pointed out that thousands of patients were awaiting their turn for the schedule of surgeries because of a shortage of doctors in the Department of Anaesthesia. This was a result of the transfer of a number of doctors to other medical college hospitals for the National Medical Commission’s inspection. There was a shortage of doctors in the Department of Dermatology and Forensic Medicine as well, and post-mortem examinations were being delayed. P.M.A. Salam, State general secretary, IUML, would open the protest meet at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, they added.\nMeanwhile, District Collector Snehil Kumar Singh is reported to have held a meeting with the hospital authorities on Monday.

To minimise risk, hospitals are limiting attendants to one person per patient and mandating masks for all staff, patients, and caregivers.\nAs health officials compiled the contact list of the 58-year-old man from Kumaramputhur, near Mannarkkad, who succumbed to Nipah at a private hospital in Perinthalmanna on Saturday evening, it was revealed that he had mainly used KSRTC buses for travel.\nThe man’s family members, including his wife, children and grandchildren, are among the primary contacts. As a precaution, the school attended by the grandchildren has been shut down.\nBefore his death at the Perinthalmanna hospital, the man had visited three other private hospitals for treatment, which may result in a lengthy contact list. As many as 112 persons who came in contact with him in the last three weeks were traced, and a route map was made by examining, among other things, surveillance camera footage.\nThe number of people under observation for Nipah rose to 609 on Monday. When 207 of them are in Malappuram district, 286 are in Palakkad, 114 in Kozhikode and two in Ernakulam.\nEight persons are under treatment in intensive care units in Malappuram, when five are under treatment in Palakkad. Health Minister Veena George said that 72 quarantined persons tested negative for Nipah in Malappuram. She said 38 persons in the State continued to be in the highest risk category and 133 in high risk category.\nHealth officials strengthened their field work in areas where restrictions were imposed by the district administration. A fever survey is also being done. As many as 17 wards in the vicinity of Kumaramputhur were declared as containment zones, covering areas within a three-kilometre radius of the Nipah-infected person’s residence.\nThe containment zones included seven wards in Kumaramputhur panchayat, three wards in Karakurissi panchayat, four wards in Mannarkkad municipality and three wards in Karimpuzha panchayat.\nCrowding is banned in those zones, and shops there can function from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. All educational institutions, including madrasas and anganwadis, have been closed there.

    "content": "India can achieve 70% round-the-clock (RTC) clean electricity for commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers by the year 2030 — at a lower cost than traditional annual clean energy procurement — according to a new report released by TransitionZero, a global climate analytics non-profit.\nThe report finds that India can deploy 52 GW (gigawatt) of RTC clean electricity capacity to serve 5% of its projected national demand by 2030, generating cost savings of up to ₹9,000 crore ($1 billion) annually for the grid. Unlike conventional renewable energy certificates that allow annual offsetting of electricity use, RTC clean energy matches every hour of consumption with power from zero-carbon sources such as solar, wind, and battery storage.\nEditorial |Energy and efficiency: On India and greater energy efficiency mandates\nIrfan Mohamed, South Asia Analyst at TransitionZero, said, “Our model shows that in India, commercial and industrial customers can meet 70% of their hourly electricity demand with carbon-free electricity at a cost below that of annual renewable energy matching, while driving greater levels of decarbonisation and providing significant benefits to the Indian electricity system.”\nAt the system level, the report shows RTC clean energy could cut emissions by 2.4% under the 70% matching scenario — more than double the 1% emissions reduction achieved under annual matching. When scaled to 100% RTC matching, the potential emissions reduction rises to 7%.\nNotably, the cost of carbon abatement under the RTC model is significantly lower. The analysis reveals that achieving carbon reductions through 70% RTC clean electricity costs nearly three times less than doing so via annual matching.\n“RTC clean electricity — also referred to as 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) — means matching every hour of electricity use with electricity from carbon-free sources. It ensures clean power is actually available when it is needed, all day, every day, instead of buying annual clean energy certificates. This approach helps drive real decarbonisation of the electricity system by encouraging clean energy at all times, not just on paper. This approach is especially important for heavy industries and data centres, whose electricity demand is typically flat around the clock, making hourly clean energy matching essential for their decarbonisation,” the report stated.\nMaharashtra, which houses the largest cluster of data centres in India, is poised to benefit significantly from the 24/7 clean energy shift. The State’s energy demand is growing rapidly, particularly from digital infrastructure, which consumes power continuously and requires high reliability.\nEarlier, climate risk assessments have already flagged four existing or planned data centres in Maharashtra as high risk. Transitioning to RTC clean energy, therefore, offers a dual benefit: reduced emissions and enhanced climate resilience.\nAlso read:Maximum MoUs in Maharashtra in sustainability and energy, says CM Fadnavis\n“TransitionZero’s analysis shows that incentivising RTC clean electricity procurement is essential for least-cost grid planning and can deliver significant savings for India’s grid operators, who play a pivotal role in the country’s electricity sector transformation. It also helps build a more resilient and sustainable market for renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs),” the report stated.\nIt also warns that failure to plan for flexibility could lead to issues seen in Europe, such as declining PPA capture rates, especially in countries like Spain, where renewable energy oversupply has reduced market revenues.\nThe modelling shows that RTC clean energy at 70% matching can be deployed using a combination of solar, onshore wind, and battery storage. Solar and batteries, in particular, show high synergy, with each MW of solar requiring approximately 2 MWh of battery storage to ensure a stable and reliable power supply throughout the day and night.\nAt 70% matching, the system not only avoids extra costs — it saves them. The report estimates that capital and operational savings could lead to net system cost reductions of up to 35% compared to the annual matching model.\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) plays a minimal role in the scenario, primarily due to high upfront costs and relatively low competitiveness with 4-hour lithium-ion batteries, which are already widely available and rapidly decreasing in price.\nThe report arrives at a critical time, as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) — the global standard for corporate emissions reporting — is reviewing its Scope 2 guidance. The revised framework is expected to move toward hourly emissions accounting, making RTC clean energy procurement increasingly relevant for ESG-compliant companies.\n“The GHGP is in the process of a multi-year revision of its standards. A central focus of this review is the update to the Scope 2 guidance — the rules governing how companies account for emissions from purchased electricity. While hourly emissions accounting is emerging as the preferred method, the GHGP does not set targets or grade performance,” the report explained.\nTo accelerate the shift, TransitionZero recommends that Indian policymakers provide clear regulatory incentives and support flexible market mechanisms that reward real-time clean energy use, not just aggregate annual numbers.\nMatt Gray, Co-founder and CEO of TransitionZero, says: “Our analysis shows round-the-clock clean electricity planning and procurement is a ‘no regrets’ option for India’s energy planners, grid operators, and large corporations. It shows companies can procure hourly-matched clean electricity at minimal extra cost, and grid operators can save money through least-cost grid planning. In doing so, governments can help deliver the energy transition at the lowest cost.”\nAs India moves towards its goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, the TransitionZero study makes a strong case for why RTC clean electricity is not just desirable — it is cost-effective, climate-smart, and future-ready."

    "content": "A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday upheld a Single Bench order of May 19 that had termed as ‘not sustainable in law’ the appointment of K. Sivaprasad and Ciza Thomas as temporary Vice-Chancellors of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and the Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology, respectively.\nMonday’s order was passed by a Division Bench comprising Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.V. Balakrishnan, while dismissing an appeal filed by Governor  Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, who is also the  Chancellor of the two universities, challenging the single judge’s order.\nWhile Mr. Sivaprasad had earlier been working as Professor, Department of Ship Technology, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Ms. Thomas had retired as Senior Joint Director from the Directorate of Technical Education.\nThe Division Bench said in its judgment that an order of temporary appointment of Vice-Chancellors, issued by the Chancellor in exercise of the powers under Section 13(7) of the Technological University Act or Section 11(10) of the Digital University Act, shall be for a period of not exceeding six months, in the aggregate.\nTherefore, the Chancellor has no power to issue notifications appointing a person to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Vice-Chancellor of the two universities, until further orders, pending regular appointment of the Vice-Chancellor. In such circumstances, the single judge cannot be found at fault for declaring the notifications as not sustainable in law, the Bench added.\nThe Bench reminded  that the Chancellor and the State Government ought to act proactively to ensure that regular appointment is made to the post of Vice-Chancellor in the universities without any delay. This was after considering the stalemate in the administration of the two universities, which has been continuing for a considerable period, and which harmed their functioning and also the interest of the student community, it said.\nAdvocate General K. Gopalakrishna Kurup submitted that the Chancellor cannot appoint any person to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Vice-Chancellor of the universities, unless the name was recommended by the government.\nReferring to Section 13(7) of the Technological University Act, where the vacancy of Vice-Chancellor arises in any of the circumstances enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), the Chancellor may appoint the Vice-Chancellor of any other university or the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the technological university or the Secretary to Government, Higher Education Department, as recommended by the government, to be the Vice-Chancellor for a period not exceeding six months in the aggregate.\nLikewise, as per Section 11(10) of the Digital University Act, if there was a temporary vacancy in the post of Vice-Chancellor due to any unforeseen reason, the Chancellor may appoint the Vice-Chancellor of any other University or the Secretary of the Electronics and Information Technology Department, as recommended by the government, to be the Vice-Chancellor for a period not exceeding six months, in the aggregate, the court observed.\nCiting observations of the Supreme Court and how universities ought to function in an autonomous manner, the court further said being a leader and head of the institution, the V-C has to play an important role. The V-C functions as a bridge between the executive and academic wings of the university. As per norms, the V-C must be an eminent academician, and excellent administrator and also someone having high moral stature, it said."

    "content": "Doctors at the JSS Medical College in Mysuru have suggested a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the complaints of ‘stomach pain’ by children even though physical illnesses of any kind have been ruled out by laboratory investigations.\nThe doctors, who carried out a study that was presented at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry conference at NIMHANS in Bengaluru, found certain psychological causes for some complaints of stomach pain by children.\nThough the study was confined to four children complaining of stomach pain despite showing no physical illness after undergoing laboratory investigations like diagnostic laparoscopy, endoscopy, and CT abdominal scan, paediatric surgeon Sudhamshu K.C. said some of the major reasons for children complaining of stomach pain without any underlying cause included depression followed by learning disability, bullying at school, issues with parents, and visual disturbances.\nOut of every 100 children referred to the paediatric surgery department of the hospital, about 15 to 20% qualify for multidisciplinary approach involving doctors from psychiatry, paediatrics, and paediatric surgery departments, said Dr. Sudhamshu, who was part of the study.\nDoctors said the children who complain about stomach pain without any physical illness will actually feel the psychosomatic pain arising out of psychological issues. Such children even refuse to go to school, missing out on their studies for extended period of months together.\nEven though paediatric surgery was a referral department, Professor of Psychiatry, JSS Medical College, Mysuru, M. Kishor said a large number of parents were presenting themselves before the paediatric surgery department directly seeking surgical intervention for the stomach pain of their children.\nOver the last year, about 12 to 14 children with stomach pain, who qualified for such a multidisciplinary approach, had been actively engaged with the departments of psychiatry and paediatrics, he said.\nAfter working closely with the affected children and their parents, the team of doctors from the different departments had found that the causes among these children ranged from specific learning disabilities (dyslexia), depression, anxiety, mobile addiction, intellectual disabilities, issues in parents, including over-parenting, besides poor eating and sleeping habits, Dr. Kishor said.\n“Through such an approach, we have been able to avoid a large number of unnecessary surgical interventions. Most of the children, who were under the collaborative care of psychiatry and paediatric department, are back in school,” he said."

The State government has now proposed the Directorate of Urban Affairs as the nodal agency for coordinating activities related to the city logistics plans.\n\nThe National Logistics Policy (NLP) aims to drive economic growth and business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network using advanced technology, processes, and skilled manpower. The city logistics plans are expected to be a comprehensive framework designed to optimise urban goods movement, reduce costs, and minimise environmental impact.\n\nIt will be a strategic plan designed to adequately address the urban freight and logistics needs of the city’s population and businesses to achieve economic growth with better quality of life and environment. The CLP helps identify the main needs, plan and evaluate the possible solutions for urban freight and logistics in and around the city. It is expected to foster collaboration among government bodies, transport providers, businesses, and citizens. The logistics plan will be prepared in a structure and format that can be easily integrated with the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) of the city.\n\nOne of the focus areas will be in reducing urban emissions by optimising vehicle movement within cities through strategic routing and consolidation of freight. The plan will also prioritise efficiency by optimising goods movement. This involves development of freight infrastructure and its integration into commercial streets, optimisation of freight routes, smart traffic management systems utilising real-time data, ensuring prompt deliveries and minimising operational costs."

Bindu has said that the Kerala High Court decision to annul the appointment of temporary Vice-Chancellors for Digital University Kerala and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University has validated the State government’s position in the issue.\n“For quite some time, the government’s stance has been proven correct by court rulings. While the Chancellor does have powers related to universities, overstepping these boundaries can lead to complications,” the Minister told mediapersons here.\nShe added that the universities in the State function within the framework of laws enacted by the Legislative Assembly, while the overall oversight lies with the State government. “Court rulings have proved that the unilateral appointments of Vice-Chancellors, both by the previous Governor and the current one, are unconstitutional,” she said.\nDr. Bindu also said that Vice-Chancellors must focus on providing an environment conducive to learning, rather than being involved in political moves. The responsibility of upholding academic interests must come first. “It is imperative that we adhere to established procedures, and any deviation from this leads to legal intervention, as the courts have demonstrated,” she said.\nGeneral Education Minister V. Sivankutty also hailed the High Court ruling as a victory for the government’s commitment to ensuring transparency in the education sector. The verdict is a decisive step in the government’s pursuit of achieving excellence in the higher education sector, he said.\nThe Confederation of University Employees Organisations, Kerala, stated that the decision is a strong rebuke to the unlawful actions of the Governor. The organisation added that the Governor’s decision to override the State’s panel of nominees was a direct attack on academic autonomy and the rights of the academic community.\nThe Federation of University Teachers Associations also welcomed the ruling, stating that it underscores the importance of following the legal framework and respecting the democratic processes in university governance. They strongly advocated the resignation of the temporary Vice-Chancellors who were appointed “unlawfully”."

He said that the former administration failed to utilise the Central government schemes and mismanaged the energy sector, resulting in a heavy burden on the people.\nHe along with Minister for Social Welfare Dr. Dola Sree Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy laid the foundation stone of the 33\\11 KV substation at Kalluru village in Kurichedu mandal of Prakasam district. The substation, sanctioned at a cost of ₹3.80 crore, is part of the Coalition government’s efforts to strengthen the power supply network in high-demand areas, the Energy Minister said.\nMr. Gottipati also laid the foundation stone for another 33/11 KV substation in Darsi and participated in ‘Suparipalana Lo Tholi Adugu’ campaign. He highlighted that the construction of substations is being undertaken to meet the growing electricity consumption needs and announced that 12 substations have been approved across the combined Prakasam district.\nReiterating the government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers, he said that 75,000 agricultural power connections have already been sanctioned, with ₹2.60 lakh being spent on each connection. He asserted that the Coalition government under the leadership of Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu is taking corrective steps to rebuild the power infrastructure that was neglected in the YSRCP regime.\nThe Minister also urged citizens to make use of Central government schemes like PM Suryagarh and PM Kusum. He encouraged households to install rooftop solar panels to reduce electricity bills and ease the load on the conventional power grid. He directed the officials to coordinate with bankers to ensure at least 10,000 Suryagarh connections are facilitated in each constituency.\nCriticising the YSRCP government, he said that it not only ignored these beneficial schemes but also increased power tariffs nine times, putting a significant burden on the public. “The Coalition government has not hiked power charges even once since assuming office. The substations are being constructed in rural areas to resolve low voltage issues arising due to high load,” he added.\nHe reaffirmed that the Coalition government is committed to providing 24-hour quality electricity to every household and farming community. He concluded by stating that as long as Chandrababu Naidu is in the office, there is no intention to increase electricity tariffs, and all efforts will be made to restore and strengthen the systems weakened under the previous administration."

    "content": "With the caravan tourism project failing to take-off as expected, the State government has decided to extend the  subsidy for the project for one more year to give a renewed thrust to the project. The project has been progressing slowly due to  lack of interest from private players.\nAs per a government order, the subsidy scheme announced  in 2021 to promote caravan tourism has only a three-year validity, up to October 2024. The Tourism department has earmarked ₹3.10 crore for promoting caravan tourism for the 2025-26 fiscal. Considering this, the State has changed a clause that restricts the disbursal of investment subsidy and extended it  until December 31, 2025.\nAlthough a couple of caravan parks started functioning in Kerala, since the project was flagged off in 2021, only the one at Malampuzha in Palakkad is operational at present.\nAccording to Sajeev Kurup, general secretary of the Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industries, who owns the Malampuzha facility, the absence of a chain of caravan parks is thwarting the progress of the project. Though his park was opened in February this year, he had received only a few guests due to the absence of a dedicated network of caravan parks.\nHe says the project was conceived after the pandemic outbreak, giving tourists an opportunity to immerse themselves in the natural beauty of unexplored destinations in Kerala.  As per the project proposal, it still has relevance, but a parallel ecosystem suited for promoting caravan tourism needs to be developed, he says.\nIn the past four years, around 20 caravan vehicle owners benefitted from the investment subsidy. However, only six caravans are actively providing services, while the rest have been deployed for services at  marriage functions, cinema locations, pilgrimages etc.\nPrashanth Vasudev, former Deputy Director of Kerala Tourism and chief tourism consultant, North Malabar Tourism Organisation, says Kerala with the  highest penetration of resorts, was hardly a favourite destination for campers or caravan tourists.\n“When there is enough entertainment in resorts, especially indoor and outdoor activities, at all major tourist hotspots, it’s a challenging question how many guests will choose to stay inside a camper van or caravan in a normal picnic spot,” he said."

Srishananda made this observation while noticing that the government had not framed the rules for this purpose even though the BNSS came into force on July 1, 2024.\nThe court pointed out that the provisions of the BNSS are clear that whenever an information is received by an officer in charge of the police station under whose jurisdiction a non-cognisable offence has been committed, the officer is bound to enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book at the police station ‘as the State government may prescribe in the rules.’\nThe BNSS bars the police from initiating investigation into non-cognisable offences in the absence of a cognisable offence in the complaint without prior permission from the magistrate, the court said, while pointing out that the police will have to maintain a register/book to record complaints of non-cognisable offences and forward the report to the magistrate, who in turn would pass order allowing police to probe non-cognisable offences by registering a case, if necessary.\nThe court made these observations while noticing that Hutti police in Raichur district had not only registered a First Information Report (FIR) on a complaint of a non-cognisable offence but had also filed the charge sheet sans permission from the magistrate as Section 174 of BNSS."

    "content": "A stone inscription belonging to Kotha Ravi Perumal, the third Chera king, was unearthed from a temple compound near Manjeri.\nExperts in epigraphy have confirmed that this discovery marks Kotha Ravi Perumal’s 10th known inscription found in Kerala.\nThe Chera dynasty had ruled over the region, now known as Kerala, from the 9thto the 12thcentury with Mahodayapuram (modern-day Kodungalloor) as their capital. The inscription discovered from the Meledath Mahasiva Vettakkorumakan temple at Thrikkalangode, Manjeri, can throw more light on the Chera rule in the Malabar region.\nThe inscription is carved on a stone paved on the circumambulatory path in front of the circular sanctum sanctorum of the temple. “The letters have worn off significantly due to years of foot traffic on the path,” said K. Krishnaraj, epigraphist and officer in charge of the Pazhassi Raja Archaeological Museum, Kozhikode.\nMr. Krishnaraj, who created an estampage of the epigraph, said that the name of the Chera king was legible, but the date was unclear. Given that Kotha Ravi Perumal assumed power in 883, the inscription likely dates back to the last two decades of the 9th century.\nThe circular sanctum sanctorum of the Meledath Mahasiva Vettakkorumakan temple at Thrikkalangode, Manjeri.\nThe inscription in Vattezhuthu, an ancient script used in Kerala, begins with the auspicious phrase Swasti Sree (meaning Hail Prosperity). It refers to a specific arrangement made at the temple during Kotha Ravi Perumal’s reign.\nThe inscription has a postscript that clearly mentions that anyone violating this arrangement would be considered as transgressing the Moozhikkala system, a land management or administrative system that existed during the Chera rule.\nVeteran epigraphist M.R. Raghava Varier, who studied the inscription, said that the worn-off letters made it difficult to create a precise and full transcript. However, from the decipherable lines, he pointed out that the inscription included typical details commonly found in the Chera Perumal inscriptions. “This inscription is the 10th known record of Kotha Ravi Perumal. We have already found nine of his inscriptions from other parts of Kerala,” said Dr. Varier.\nEpistemologist K. Krishnaraj preparing an estampage of the inscription found at the Meledath Mahasiva Vettakkorumakan temple at Thrikkalangode, Manjeri.\nAccording to historian Keshavan Veluthat, the Moozhikkala system was first mentioned in the Chokoor inscription from the 15thyear of Kotha Ravi Perumal’s reign. “If the Thrikkalangode inscription predates it, then this could be the earliest record referring to the Moozhikkala system,” he said.\nHowever, Dr. Veluthat cautioned that without a clear regnal year, it would be near impossible to make a definite judgement.\nE. Dinesan, director of the State Department of Archaeology, said that the department would continue searching for inscriptions and records to shed light on Kerala’s ancient rulers.\nExcavation assistant V.A. Vimal Kumar, temple secretary Dipesh Meledath, patrons Mohanlal and Jayaprakash Babu, president Sajeev Kumar, and tantri Kakkat Subramanian Namboothiri helped Mr. Krishnaraj in unearthing and reading the inscription."

As a result, green gram and cotton are presently two to four weeks old, as some farmers sow early considering the moisture in the soil.\nAccording to information provided by the Agriculture Department, farmers completed sowing in 2,63,931 hectares of area, which is 63% against the 416,474 hectares that were the target set by the department for this khariff season.\nFarmers carried out the weeding process after a week from sowing, enabling crops to grow elegantly.\n“The crop, so far, has grown as expected. But it required immediate rains to get a good yield. If the similar dry spell continues, there is a possibility of crops withering or a lack of getting yield,” Balu Rathod, a farmer said.\nIn a few parts, where it didn’t sufficiently rain even after the arrival of the monsoon as usual, farmers started sowing late. Such crops won’t face difficulties, as the present moisture in the soil helps them.\n“It is necessary to have rain for the growing crops. But, it is expected that the cloudy atmosphere will also help crops from withering,” Ratendranath Sugur, another farmer, toldThe Hindu.\nAlthough the district received a deficit of rain, it has been experiencing scattered rains in some parts even today.\nThe hobli-wise rain that was recorded in 24 hours is as follows, the figures in brackets indicate normal rains: Shahapur received 3.9 mm against the normal 1.5 mm, Doranahalli - 3.3 mm (1.8mm), Gogi- 3.3 mm ( 1.6mm), Hayyal (B)- 0.3 mm (2.4 mm), Shorapur - 7.2 mm ( 2.6 mm), Kakkera- 5.5 mm ( 2.4mm), Kembhavi-9.4 mm ( 0.9 mm), Yadgir- 0.9 mm ( 3.9mm), Balichakra - 1.6 mm (2.7 mm), Hattikuni- 01 mm ( 2.9mm), Saidapur -0.1mm ( 2.4 mm), Gurmitkal- 2.3 mm (4.2mm), Konkal 0.2mm ( 3.4 mm), Wadagera- 1.2mm( 2.0mm), Hunsagi- 6.3 mm ( 2.00 mm) and Kodekal - nil ( 3.0 mm) respectively."

This raises urgent questions about how the contents of the report were accessed by foreign entities prior to their dissemination to the Indian public and concerned stakeholders,”she added.\nMs. Chaturvedi claimed that the non-stop insinuations being made against the deceased pilots through implication and selective leaks of the interim report through the international media were “absolutely reprehensible”.\n“Such motivated speculation via broadcast, print and digital platforms shows a more sinister attempt to malign our pilots who aren’t alive to put their case, even pilot associations have raised their objections,” she said."

Fine rice scheme and ration cards are game changers and the women folk are with the party, he said, exuding confidence that the party would sweep the forthcoming local body elections.\nHe also highlighted Telangana’s historic achievements under Congress rule, such as conducting the first caste census in 100 years, pushing for 42% BC reservations in local bodies, SC reservations classification and striving to make Telangana a $1 trillion economy.\nThe Chief Minister also pointed out the contrast between the BRS era, marked by liquor belt shops in villages, and the Congress government, under which people now queue up to receive ration cards. “Ration cards are a matter of self-respect for the poor,” he asserted."

    "content": "In a step towards climate-resilient horticulture, the ICAR–Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bengaluru, and TNAU’s Agricultural College and Research Institute at Kilvelur have launched a joint initiative to identify saline-tolerant mango varieties suited for Nagapattinam region.\nWith sea-level rising and saline water intrusion threatening agriculture in the Cauvery delta, this research aims at securing mango production in districts such as Nagapattinam, known for its unique microclimate that supports off-season flowering and fruiting — particularly in the Vedaranyam block.\n“We are screening over 15 mango varieties for their tolerance to coastal salinity and sodicity,” said Dr. M. Sankaran, Principal Scientist and Head, Division of Fruit Crops, ICAR–IIHR, Bengaluru. The trial is being conducted across three locations, including the Agricultural College campus, where saline groundwater conditions prevail. “This is a long-term study aimed at identifying varieties that can withstand and thrive under saline stress. The most resilient will be promoted among farmers as rootstocks,” he said. Once suitable rootstocks are identified, they will be grafted with high-yielding commercial scions to sustain productivity in coastal conditions.\nMango is grown on 2,385 hectares in the district with a production of 16,600 tonnes annually. Vedaranyam alone accounts for 1,500 hectares, most of which naturally bear fruit during October–November — a window that commands better market prices.\nMr. Sankaran said the institute had developed over 14 mango technologies, including ‘Mango Special’ for boosting yield and health. High-density planting is a key focus — raising tree count from 100 to over 1,000 per hectare with proper management. These technologies will be shared with farmers in the region.\n“With improved agronomic practices and the adoption of advanced technologies, farmers can significantly enhance productivity. However, labour constraints and limited awareness continue to hinder progress.” said G. Ravi, Nodal Officer at the Kilvelur Agricultural College.\nHe said the institute places special emphasis on mango cultivation, with a flagship programme focused on livelihood security and income enhancement for farmers in Nagapattinam. As part of this effort, both institutions are offering hands-on training to progressive farmers, covering integrated pest management, nutrient and flowering induction techniques, and the use of mechanised mango harvesters.\nMr. Ravi said the broader vision was to transform Nagapattinam into a science-driven hub for mango production while strengthening climate resilience and rural incomes."

Chandrababu Naidu will discuss water-related issues in New Delhi on July 16 at a meeting to be facilitated by Union Minister for Jal Shakti C.R. Patil.\nThe Telangana government has decided to mount pressure on the Centre for achieving the rightful share of Krishna and Godavari river waters. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has asked the Centre to give clearance to the Krishna Basin projects in the State, allocate water to them and provide funding for their construction. He told Minister for Irrigation N. Uttam Kumar Reddy to address a letter to Union Minister of Jal Shakti C.R. Patil in this regard.\nThe Chief Minister alleged that the K. Chandrasekhar Rao government in the past had failed to achieve the rightful share of river water, particularly in the Krishna Basin, for 10 years. By agreeing to 299 tmc ft share against 512 tmc ft to Andhra Pradesh, the previous government had allowed the neighbour to divert Krishna water indiscriminately.\nSimilarly, in the Godavari Basin too, the BRS government had abandoned the Pranahita-Chevella project with a barrage at Tummidihatti after the Congress government had spent ₹11,000 crore on it till 2014, and instead the KCR government had wasted ₹1 lakh crore on Kaleshwaram project.\nMeanwhile, Mr Uttam Reddy in his letter requested the Centre to take initiative on resolving the issues in Krishna and Godavari Basins and also clear pending clearances and allocate water to those projects. On Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi Lift Irrigation Schemes, he said they were yet to be given clearances and allocation of water, including 45 tmc ft State’s additional share in Krishna waters in lieu of A.P.’s diversion of Godavari water to Krishna Delta.\nHe reminded Mr. Patil that the Prime Minister’s Office had proposed on December 10, 2010 the national project status to Dindi LIS taken up in 2007 to address the fluoride problem. The inter-State clearance for Sammakka Sarakka Project (Thupakulagudem Barrage) was also pending despite Telangana’s readiness to pay compensation to submergence lands as Chhattisgarh was not giving a no-objection letter.\nFurther, he brought to the Union Minister’s notice that A.P. was diverting huge quantity (8-10 tmc ft a day) of Krishna water to the non-basin areas from Pothireddypadu Head Regulator, Rayalaseema LIS, Muchumarri, Malyala and Guru Raghavendra projects. He sought clearance for all projects taken up till 2014 under KWDT-I Award. Mr. Uttam Reddy also explained various other contentious issues in his letter."

The incident has been reported from Tammiganipalli village of Karalaghatta panchayat under Santhipuram mandal of Kuppam Assembly Constituency.\nThe video which went viral on social media shows an elderly woman, identified as Gangamma, tied to a power pole with a plastic rope. After a thorough probe, senior police officials of Kuppam sub-division said that Muneppa, the family head, passed away on July 5. He had two wives – Munemma and Gangamma – and disputes cropped up over property among their children.\nIn an attempt to gain sympathy and an upper hand, Suresh tied his mother Gangamma to the pole, recorded the act, and blamed his step-brother Manjunath (son of Munemma) for the “heinous act”, by posting the video on social media platforms on Sunday.\n“Though the act appears to be a case of abuse, our inquiry found that it was a staged act to gain sympathy by one side of a family and throw the blame on the other side,” a police official said. The police arrested Suresh on Monday and registered a case.\nIt may be noted here that a similar incident was reported in Kuppam a couple of weeks ago, when a money-lender tied a woman to a tree and beat her after she failed to repay a debt with exorbitant interest. The report caught the attention of the entire State, which led to the intervention of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, who represents Kuppam constituency. She was granted with ₹5 lakh financial assistance and other government benefits. The police had registered a criminal case against the money-lender and made the arrest."

However, with the blessings of Matha Chowdeshwari the project has been completed. Now, I announce that from now on, the bridge will be called Sigandur Chowdeshwari Bridge,” he said.\nReferring to the achievements of his department, Mr. Gadkari said when Narendra Modi-led government came to power in 2014, the total length of the national highway in Karnataka was 6,770 km.

The programme to dedicate the bridge to the nation was organised in a hurry, as there was a chance of the people facing trouble with the heavy rains. “In the absence of the bridge, the residents were dependent on the ferries. However, operating them would be impossible if the water level increased in the dam. Hence, the bridge was inaugurated so that the people enjoy its benefits in the present rainy season itself,” he said.\nHe urged the Union Minister to sanction the Agumbe Ghat tunnel project and upgrade the road connecting Hosapete and Balehonnur via Shivamogga as a national highway.\nFormer Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, former Minister Kagodu Thimmappa, Lok Sabha members Kota Srinivasa Poojari, Captain Brijesh, BJP State unit president B.Y. Vijayendra, legislators Araga Jnanendra, Gururaj Ghantiholi, S.N. Channabasappa, Cement manju, and others were present.\nThe Union Minister dedicated to the nation the widening and improvement of Bidar–Humnabad stretch of the NH-50 completed at a cost of ₹345 crore; four-lane railway overbridge, two-lane bridge in Kalaburagi–Yadgiri stretch of NH-150 built at a cost of ₹65 crore; seven minor bridges from Mani to Sampaji on NH-275 at a cost of ₹52 crore; the restoration of Shiradi Ghat of NH-75 at a cost of ₹41 crore; and two-lane stretch from Bhanapur–Gaddanakeri stretch on NH-367 at a cost of ₹173 crore.\nHe laid the foundation stones for the construction of the four-lane ROB at Wadi on NH-150 at a cost of ₹88 crore, the construction of a retaining wall from Sampaje to Kushanalanagara on NH-275 at a cost of ₹94 crore, and additional works to ensure road safety for the six-lane Bengaluru-Mysuru access-controlled section of NH-275 at ₹712 crore."

    "content": "Dramatic scenes played out in a council meeting of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation on Monday as the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led opposition levelled corruption allegations against each other, leading to scuffles and prolonged protests. While theLDF reiterated its allegations against BJP councillorsP.V. Manju and G.S. Asha Nath, the BJP accused favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers.\nWomen councillors of the BJP occupied the Mayor’s dais much before the beginning of the council meeting in the afternoon. The BJP councillors held placards demanding the resignation of the Mayor. Meanwhile, the LDF councillors also began sloganeering, holding placards demanding the resignation of the two councillors accused of corruption. The tense standoff continued for about half an hour, after which police personnel removed the women councillors of the BJP from the Mayor’s dais, despite stiff resistance from the BJP.\nAfter the dais was cleared, Mayor Arya Rajendran took her seat and attempted to start the council meeting, but the remaining BJP councillors held a banner blocking the Mayor’s view. Two Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] councillors tore away the banner leading to a scuffle between both sides. The agendas related to the various standing committees were read out and the meeting concluded amid the sloganeering.\nThe BJP had alleged that the ruling LDF had slyly incorporated the name of Kazhakuttam councillor L.S. Kavitha and a few of the party’s favourites in the appointment list for the sanitation workers. It further alleged that the appointment process was delayed for an year to ensure that the councillor’s resignation to take up her job will not trigger a byelection.\nHealth Standing Committee chairperson Gayathri Babu said that the Employment Exchange had provided the list of 671 prospective candidates to fill the 56 vacancies for sanitation workers. The councillor’s name was also part of the list as she had registered with the Employment Exchange years ago. A total of 403 people from the list participated in the interview. Out of them, 363 people participated in the physical tests. The Corporation has now approved a finalised list of 348 candidates, from which appointments will be made later. The list was prepared by following all reservation norms.\nLater, addressing a press conference, LDF parliamentary party leader D.R. Anil said that the BJP has levelled baseless allegations and unleashed violence in the council meeting to divert attention from the corruption allegations against two of its councillors. In the 2015-2020 period too, one of the councillors had secured a job as a contingent worker through a transparent process after registering through the Employment Exchange, he said.\nThe United Democratic Front (UDF) alleged in a press release that the differences over dividing the posts of sanitation workers between the LDF and the BJP led to the scuffles witnessed in the council.\nBJP councillor P.V. Manju of the Punnakkamugal ward is accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The other allegation was against Pappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath, whom the LDF accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application forms for various schemes."

    "content": "Strongly condemning the police manhandling of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Chief MinisterOmar Abdullah in Srinagar, the Left parties accused Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha of undermining the smooth functioning of the duly elected State government.\nThe CPI(M) Polit Bureau, in a statement in New Delhi, said that the Central government headed by the BJP is trying to enforce its own diktats and regressive points of view. The abolition of holiday on Martyrs’ Day is an example of this, it said. “On the other hand, the birthday of the Maharaja, responsible for killing freedom fighters, is declared a holiday. The Lt. Governor appointed by the Central government is undermining the smooth functioning of the duly elected State government,” the Polit Bureau said.\nThe CPI(M) also criticised the house arrest of various J&K political leaders, including CPI(M)’s Yusuf Tarigami, who were prevented from paying homage to the martyrs. The party demanded that the holiday on Martyrs’ Day be restored “to respect and protect the democratic rights of the people of J&K”. It also demanded an apology from the Lt. Governor for the “assault” on the CM.\nJammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah jumped over the boundary wall of Mazar-e-Shuhada to recite prayers after he was allegedly stopped by the security forces, in Srinagar on Monday. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                ANI\nCPI general secretary D. Raja said that the incident was “utterly unacceptable”.\n“This is not just a breach of democratic norms. It’s a blatant assault on our conscience and a reminder of how far governance in J&K has fallen under authoritarian unaccountable rule. CPI demands immediate restoration of statehood — no ifs, no buts — so that the people’s representatives can truly serve, instead of being silenced and subjugated,” he posted on X.\nMr. Abdullah, in a post on X, said that he was blocked from offering prayers at the graves of the martyrs on Sunday, at Naqsbandh Sahib shrine at Khawaja Bazar, where 22 civilians killed during an uprising against the Dogra ruler were buried. The Chief Minister scaled the fenced wall of the premises because the security forces had blocked the entrance of the graveyard. A police officer made a bid to stop him from offering ‘fateha’ at the graveyard."

    "content": "The prescribed fees for MBBS in self-financing medical colleges under management and NRI quotas has been increased, with the Selection Committee putting out the revised fee structure for the academic year 2025-2026 as per the order of the Committee on Fixation of Fee in respect of self-financing professional colleges, on Monday.\nAs per the order, the fees for government quota in the 21 self-financing medical colleges were ₹4,35,000 to ₹4,50,000. The management quota fee was fixed at ₹15,00,000, while it was ₹27,00,000 for NRI quota.\nIn its order, the committee - Justice R. Pongiappan is the chairman and P. Senthil Kumar (Health Secretary) is member secretary - said that the fee included tuition fee, admission fee, special fee, laboratory/computer/internet fee, library fee, sports fee, maintenance and amenities fee, extracurricular activities fee and other recurring expenditure.\nManickavel Arumugam, education counsellor, gave a comparison of the increase in fee structure. “The good thing is that the government quota fee in self-financing medical colleges remains untouched. The fee for management quota and NRI quota has been increased. From ₹13,50,000, the management quota fee has been increased to  ₹15,00,000, while for NRI quota, the fee has been increased from ₹24,50,000 to ₹27,00,000,” he said.\n“Another positive aspect is that they have completely done away with the NRI lapsed quota category. So, through this, the NRI quota seats that fall vacant will be added to the management quota,” he added.\nFor State private university medical colleges, the committee noted that four institutions in the category were established recently - during 2022 to 2024 - and the fee was fixed during the same period. So, the committee unanimously decided that except the NRI quota, the fee hike for these institutions pertaining to undergraduate and post graduate medical courses is not necessary at present.\nWhile the fee for government quota in these institutions was ₹5,40,000, it was ₹16,20,000 for management quota and ₹30,00,000 for NRI quota. Mr. Arumugam pointed out that NRI fee has increased from ₹29.4 lakh\nThe committee stated that these fees do not include hostel, transport and mess charges that are optional for students. The institutions were directed to submit the details of these fees to the Selection Committee well in advance before the commencement of counselling. It also directed the institutions not to collect or levy any other recurring or non-recurring fee including capitation fee. In case of any deviation from the order, the committee said it will send a recommendation to the respective authority for withdrawal of approval by the National Medical Commission and disaffiliation by the respective university as well as the imposition of fine.\nHowever, healthcare professionals in the know-how said there is a greater need for the Selection Committee to keep an eye on collection of excess fees from students. “Tamil Nadu has one of the highest fee structures for MBBS in private universities in the country. Some institutions also charge students for the fifth year (house surgeoncy). Some fee heads such as hostel fee remain murky and should be closely monitored for excess fee collection,” a source said."

Psychology claims that learning more languages increases the development of the human brain. In the interest of national unity and with the aim of promoting the learning of multiple languages, the three-language formula has been implemented in the country since 1961. Language experts are of the opinion that learning languages is beneficial. The three-language formula enables students to communicate effectively in different languages. It facilitates students to pursue careers and studies in other states,” he stated."

Party sources said that many legislators had raised the issue of lack of funding for development works and inaccessibility of many Ministers, based on which the Central leader was interacting with the Ministers.\nOn Monday, he met Housing Minister B.Z.

The Minister said that some legislators had spoken about the need for allotment of more houses in their constituencies, and that it had come up for discussion.\n“Mr. Surjewala has told me that my department was number one in performance and I am elated with the compliment. Unlike others, he does not compliment unnecessarily.”\nEducation Minister Madhu Bangarappa is also expected to meet the Central leader as part of the exercise to review the OBC cell since functioning of all the wings of the parties are also being reviewed.\nSources said that though Mr. Surjewala is expected to meet all Ministers and the remaining legislators during this visit, he is likely to return if his interactions remained incomplete. “He is expected to submit a report to AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi after the completion of the exercise.”\nEarlier, Cooperation Minister K.N. Rajanna, identified with the Chief Minister’s camp, had expressed unhappiness with Mr. Surjewala talking to the legislators and said that he was not happy with the exercise.\nSources in the party said the Chief Minister’s camp in general was miffed with the exercise."

    "content": "Kolkata\nThousands of teaching and non-teaching staffers of West Bengal government schools, whose jobs were terminated after the Supreme Court order on April 3, marched to the State Secretariat on Monday. Though they were stopped midway, a group of 20 protesters was allowed to meet Chief Secretary Manoj Pant at Howrah Police Line in Shibpur.\nMonday’s march came in response to the West Bengal School Service Commission starting a fresh recruitment process as per the apex court order. The last date to submit the application was to end on Monday but the WBSSC extended it to July 21.\nTight security arrangements were made outside the secretariat and the surrounding areas. A contingent of police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel, armed with water cannons, were deployed to stop the protesters. They clashed with the police at several locations while trying to cross the barricades.\nAccording to the representatives of ‘Joggya Sikkhak Sikkhika Adhikar Mancha’ (Deserving Teachers’ Rights Forum), they did not fill out the form for fresh recruitment. “The government is standing beside the people who acquired jobs dishonestly through money, and the ones who deserved it through merit are being deprived and ignored. This is a shame on the administration,” Chinmoy Mondal, a representative of JSSAM, said during the march.\nThe protesters have been demanding that the government publish the OMR (optical mark recognition) sheets of the 2016 examination, along with a complete list of “untainted” candidates, and an unconditional reinstatement of their jobs.\n“The Chief Secretary and Education Secretary were present at the meeting. But the meeting remained inconclusive,” Mehboob Mondal, a representative of the JSSAM, said.\nThe protesters said the Chief Secretary only gave them 10 minutes to discuss the issue, and the government is conducting their own internal meeting with the representatives. The teachers claimed that accessing the list of tainted and untainted teachers is their right and is not a “handout” by the government. They also vowed to boycott all indoor meetings if no concrete solution on publishing the list of “untainted” appointees is reached by Monday midnight.\nMeanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari wrote a letter addressing the teachers on social media and stated that the BJP stands by them. “Today, once again, your call for the Nabanna campaign remained unfulfilled... Mamata Banerjee knows very well how to scatter your movement with deceit and false promises,” Mr. Adhikari wrote on X.\nResponding to it, Trinamool Congress spokesperson, Kunal Ghosh said that political parties are trying to use the teachers’ cause to do politics. “State government is trying in its own way. We are with the deserving teachers,” Mr. Ghosh said."

    "content": "The show of strength and unity between Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray on July 5 has rekindled hopes of their reunification among the cadre of their respective parties — the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.\nThe estranged cousins, who had not shared a dais for nearly two decades, came together to address a joint ‘victory rally’ in Mumbai. They celebrated the government’s rollback of two orders making Hindi the third language in primary schools in Maharashtra. The government’s revocation is being perceived as a victory for the ‘Marathi manoos’.\nHowever, the big question remains: will the two cousins reunite on the political front as brand Thackeray at a time when regional parties feel threatened by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)? And if they do, what will that mean for the politics of Maharashtra, especially for Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who leads the Shiv Sena?\nMr. Uddhav Thackeray’s party continues to face an exodus after the split of the Shiv Sena in 2022. The former Chief Minister has publicly expressed his desire for a political reunification with his cousin. However, Mr. Raj Thackeray has maintained a stoic silence and has asked his party leadership to resist from expressing their opinions on the matter. The suspense, ahead of the crucial Mumbai municipal corporation elections, continues.\nIn April, the Maharashtra government introduced a three-language policy in primary education; it issued another order in June. These were largely perceived as an attempt to impose Hindi on the State. What began as an agitation against this policy has turned into a window of opportunity for the reunification of the Thackeray cousins.\nMr. Uddhav Thackeray and Mr. Raj Thackeray’s parties had publicly split 19 years ago. The two leaders have since led separate regional parties. When they came together at the joint victory rally at Mumbai’s NSCI Dome on July 5, cadre from both parties watched with excitement. For them, it seemed like a step towards a long-cherished dream of seeing the cousins together again. Their hopes went up further when Mr. Uddhav Thackeray, amid loud cheers, said, “We have come together to stay together.” This led to speculation that the two parties will come together for the local body elections.\nThe Shiv Sena (UBT), which is struggling to keep its flock together, is anxious that fence-sitters may ditch it before the municipal elections. The Sena has traditionally controlled Mumbai’s civic body, which is the richest corporation in the country. The diminished strength of the Shiv Sena (UBT) after Mr. Shinde’s exit, the changed demography of the island city, and continuing exodus from the party are some of Mr. Uddhav Thackeray’s key concerns.\nMr. Raj Thackeray has his own set of woes. He has been leading a regional party with limited electoral gains so far. As he frequently changes his political stance, the public perceives him as unpredictable, which has not helped his cause.\nMr. Shinde’s party is hoping that the cousins will not patch up. Mr. Shinde has kept the communication window with Mr. Raj Thackeray open to the extent that his party cadre do not attack the MNS even as they relentlessly target Mr. Uddhav Thackeray.\nThe BJP is aware that Mr. Shinde will suffer a body blow if the Thackeray cousins come together. Leaders of both the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS claim that the move could be a game-changer and could impact the BJP negatively as well.\nSo far, Mr. Raj Thackeray and Mr. Uddhav Thackeray have been fighting separately on Hindutva-related issues and Marathi pride. Amid the BJP’s Hindutva appeal, the Thackeray cousins have stood for regional chauvinism. “We are Hindus, not Hindis,” Raj Thackeray said, as a pitch against the ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan’ plank of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He has warned against national integration through homogenisation and has batted for a separate cultural and linguistic identity for Maharashtra.\nAt the same time, Mr. Raj Thackeray has categorically stated that he came together with his cousin only for the cause of Marathi. MNS leaders say the show of strength is limited only to that issue, and that Mr. Raj Thackeray has not yet made up his mind on whether it should translate into something more. Political pundits say that if the cousins reunite and assert their political capital, they will both stand to gain.\nvinaya.deshpande@thehindu.co.in"

    "content": "The Kerala High Court has directed the State government to appoint a person as a driver in the police department on compassionate grounds, despite his criminal antecedents.\nHis mother, who had been employed as a part-time sweeper in the department, had died while in service. Stating that there existed no relevant connection between the offences he allegedly committed and the nature of the post in question, a Division Bench of Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Johnson John said that the petitioner, Jijin R., had been offered the post of police constable (driver) under the compassionate scheme, following his mother’s death in 2017. He belongs to an economically-backward community.\nThe government rejected his appointment, citing his involvement in a few criminal cases, which reportedly included assault, trespass, consuming alcohol in public, and a matrimonial dispute that was subsequently settled. His alleged failure to disclose these in the verification form was cited as yet another reason to deny him employment.\nRelying on what it termed as the ‘nexus test’, the court said that it had to be seen whether there was any link between the past offences and the post to which he would have joined. It also has to be seen whether he can be denied access to public employment, given his social and economic backgrounds and the hurdles he faced in life. Minor lapses must not permanently shut the door to reform, the court said and ordered that he be appointed in four weeks’ time."

Venugopal apart from State leaders, including Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Rajesh Kumar.\nIndependent Lok Sabha member from Purnia, Pappu Yadav, was also part of the meeting.\nMr. Pappu Yadav’ presence at the AICC meeting seeks to make a political point as he was not allowed to share stage along with Mr. Gandhi and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav’s joint protests against the SIR in Patna on July 9.\nThe differences between the Purnia Lok Sabha member and the RJD leadership are well known. After the meeting, Mr. Pappu Yadav refused to acknowledge Mr. Tejashwi Yadav as the sole chief ministerial face of the RJD-Congress alliance in the State.\nThe PCC chief, however, played down the differences.\n“There is no confusion within our alliance on any issue,” Mr. Kumar said, adding, “All the leaders of the INDIA alliance said in one voice that we should constitute the campaigning, manifesto committee as soon as possible”."

Mr. Prasad urged the police officers to take strict and effective action to prevent crimes.\nHis meeting with the top police officials is in the backdrop of back-to-back murders in and around Patna. Industrialist Gopal Khemka murder in Patna has created a bad impression of law and order.\nIt was evident from the fact that not only opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress, even NDA partner and Union Minister Chirag Paswan have also raised questions on the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar.\nOn Sunday (July 13, 2025), a lawyer was shot dead in Patna City area and on Saturday (July 12, 2025), a former BJP leader and a businessman was shot dead by criminals in Patna and Sitamarhi district respectively.\nThe former Union Minister spoke and discussed in detail about crime control and law and order in Patna.\nMr. Prasad urged the officials to take effective action so that there was no atmosphere of fear in Patna. He said that by taking prompt action in serious cases, the incidents could be solved, and the culprits would be punished.\nApart from this, Mr. Prasad emphasised on increasing police patrolling in Patna, so that the general public could feel safe.\n“The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has done effective work in crime control and it is necessary to maintain this image,” Mr. Prasad said in his media statement.\nMr. Prasad also urged the police officials that if some elements were promoting crime under conspiracy, then strict action should be taken against them. Also, if any mistake had been committed by any police officer at the lower level, then it should be reviewed and action taken.\nReacting to criminal incidents, before the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 18, Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said criminal disorder of law and order had taken place in Bihar.\n“Time has come that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not use teleprompter and should speak his own mind. There is a horrific situation in Bihar as teachers, engineers, lawyers, businessmen, doctors and contractors are being murdered. Nobody is safe here, even BJP leaders are being killed. Has the Prime Minister expressed his concern over the law and order or again he will give a speech,” Mr. Yadav told the media in Patna.\nHe added that if Modijiwas taking the vote of people of Bihar, then it was also his responsibility to provide safety and security.\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at the Nitish government by posting a message on social media ‘X’ saying, “Bihar has become the ‘Crime Capital of India’ — fear in every lane, unease in every home! Unemployed youth are being turned into killers by the reign of goons. The CM is busy saving his seat, while BJP ministers are raking in commissions. I’m repeating again - this time, the vote is not just to change the government, but to save Bihar.”"

Last week, the Chief Minister wrote to its vice-chairperson, expressing deep concern that a map intended to show West Bengal in a report had instead printed the map of Bihar."

He assured the States that procedural formalities under the scheme had been kept simple to ensure ease of access and encourage wide participation.\nCiting the data published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), he said in the meeting that over 17 crore employment opportunities were generated during the last decade. “This is a reflection of the significant economic progress made by the country, particularly driven by robust growth in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and services,” he said, adding that schemes like ELI are designed to create quality jobs, deepen formalisation, and support inclusive development.\nHe urged the State Ministers to promote the scheme through media briefings, television and radio interviews, and other outreach platforms.

Over 1.38 lakh students are enrolled in these schools with at least 85% of them from Scheduled Tribe communities.\nOne official explained that this initiative provided a one-time financial assistance of ₹7,500 each to two top-performing students from each stream — Science, Humanities, and Commerce — in every school that has had students appear for the Class XII board examinations for the academic year ending in 2025.\nThe discretionary fund was sanctioned to NESTS earlier this year, which was transferred through direct bank transfer to the students’ account set up by their respective schools within 2-3 weeks of the results being announced, officials said.\nThey added that the selection of meritorious students for receiving this grant had a tie-breaker mechanism as well which had worked in a preference for girl students and was used in one instance where 20 students from 10 EMRSs had secured the same marks. If the tie persisted, Class XI performance would be considered.\nA statement from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs on Monday said that the initiative “underscores the shared vision of the Hon’ble President of India and NESTS to foster equitable access to quality education, incentivise scholastic achievement, and empower tribal youth to confidently pursue higher education and professional aspirations”.\nThe EMRS programme to run residential schools for tribal children is among the main schemes implemented by the Tribal Affairs Ministry at the Centre and has been a key plank for the current administration to highlight its commitment to reaching Scheduled Tribe communities.\nThe scheme, in existence since 1997-98, has seen major reforms beginning in the first term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which included sanctioning over 600 new Eklavya schools across the country, and setting up the NESTS as a central administrator of the schools."

    "content": "The Central Railway on Monday submitted before the Bombay High Court that a multi-disciplinary probe into theJune 9 Mumbra railway tragedy, in which five commuters died after falling from an overcrowded local train, was under way and the final report was currently under review.\nThe disclosure was made through an affidavit filed by Pravindra Wanjari, Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Mumbai Division of Central Railway, in connection with a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed in 2024, which sought urgent measures to address fatalities from track crossing and falls on Mumbai’s suburban rail network.\nAccording to the Railways, preliminary observations from the Mumbra incident pointed to a dangerous combination of “track curvature” and “passenger imbalance” caused by the simultaneous passing of two fast local trains.\nA multi-disciplinary team all based in Mumbai, CSMT, who were constituted to investigate the incident included key officials from divisional heads of respective branches having knowledge in rail safety and operations: Senior Divisional Safety Officer, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Senior Divisional Operations Manager (General), Senior Divisional Engineer (South), and the Senior Divisional Electrical Engineer (Traction Rolling Stock Operations).\nThe officials are conducting a detailed investigation into the accident to find out the actual cause and find a resolution to passenger safety concerns. The report of the committee is under investigation.\nThe affidavit noted that while the Railways was implementing a series of long-term structural upgrades, real-time mitigation continued to be constrained by land acquisition delays, monsoon conditions, and high traffic volume that restricted daytime work. “Central Railway Suburban system in itself is a complex network. During monsoon, the work gets slowed down, as no digging is done due to safety reasons. Further, the work is to be carried out ensuring the safety of a large volume of traffic. Major work is carried out only during night blocks. Supervisors are simultaneously engaged for regular maintenance works. Land acquisition issues, encroachment issues, public resentment in encroachment removal and boundary wall construction etc., also delay the work. Railway Administration is committed to provide safe and comfortable journey to the commuters, and all sincere efforts are always taken in that regard. The difficulties in execution of works may kindly be appreciated, and it may not kindly be construed as inaction or slow action,” the Railways informed the court.\nThe High Court was also informed of several safety initiatives already implemented under the “Mission Zero Death” campaign. These included fencing at 47 platforms, plugging of 204 trespass-prone openings, removal of over 1,260 encroachments, and installation of warning systems and illusionary posters at high-risk spots.\nAt Diva station, where accidents were frequent, a targeted combination of escalators, barbed wire barriers, platform fencing, and continuous RPF deployment has led to a marked reduction in fatalities, with no reported deaths since August 2023.\nTo address the issue of falls from moving trains, the Railways has undertaken knurling on grab poles, added extra handles in Siemens rakes, and slewed tracks to reduce crowding between major stations like Sion-Kurla and Mulund-Thane. Over 800 establishments have been requested to stagger office timings to ease peak-hour pressure.\nIn the long term, the Railways plans to construct 43 new foot overbridges (FOBs), install 139 escalators and 62 lifts by December 2027, and implement major corridor upgrades, including the Panvel-Karjat and Kalva-Airoli suburban links, and a new Thane station to decongest the central line.\nData submitted by the Railways showed that in 2024 alone, 674 people died from track crossing and 387 from falling off trains. In the first five months of 2025, 293 and 150 such deaths had already been recorded, respectively.\nWhile affirming its commitment to commuter safety, the Railways urged the court to acknowledge the operational complexities of Mumbai’s high-density rail system. “Delays in work execution should not be construed as inaction. We remain committed to improving passenger safety,” the affidavit stated.\nThe High Court has given two weeks’ time to the petitioner to submit suggestions, if any, to the affidavit of the Railways."

    "content": "GUWAHATI\nResearchers have found a great diversity of grassland bird species in the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.\nIn the first such survey of avians conducted between March 18 and May 25, a team of forest officials, bird experts, scientists, and conservationists recorded 43 grassland species across Kaziranga’s three wildlife divisions. The survey report was released on Monday (July 14, 2025), marking a milestone in the documentation and protection of grassland-dependent bird species in the Brahmaputra floodplains.\nThey included the critically endangered Bengal florican, the endangered Finn’s weaver, and the swamp grass babbler. Among the remaining 40 species, six were in the vulnerable category — the black-breasted parrotbill, marsh babbler, swamp francolin, Jerdon’s babbler, slender-billed babbler, and bristled grassbird.\n“A highlight of this survey is that the Finn’s weaver, locally known astukura chorai, is breeding successfully. This remarkable bird, a master nest-builder atop trees, is a vital indicator of grassland health,” Assam’s Environment Minister, Chandra Mohan Patowary, said while releasing the report.\nThe 1,174 sq. km Kaziranga is a mix of grasslands, forestlands, and wetlands.\n“The study is significant because wet grasslands are not very well surveyed in India. Kaziranga’s grassland bird diversity can, thus, be compared in terms of species richness with the dry grasslands of Gujarat and Rajasthan,” the national park’s director, Sonali Ghosh, said.\nA key highlight of the study was the deployment of passive acoustic recorders, enabling non-invasive and continuous monitoring even in inaccessible or high-risk areas. This approach significantly improved species detection, especially of shy and cryptic birds, enhancing the overall accuracy and depth of the findings.\nThe report identifies several critical grassland habitats within Kaziranga that support significant populations of threatened and endemic species. One such habitat is the park’s Kohora Range, where a breeding colony of the Finn’s weaver was spotted."

The lawyers asked authorities to take legal action against Mr. Raj so that “public peace” is not disturbed.\n“On July 5, 2025, Raj Thackeray made hateful and provocative statements in a public meeting. During his speech, the instructions “Do not make any video as evidence of any such incident” is clearly aiding and abetting a serious and premeditated crime and also the intention to destroy or conceal evidence is clear, which is a crime under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” mentioned the letter.\nMarathi-Hindi debate has taken centre stage in Maharashtra, with multiple instances of violence, including the recent incident of Mira-Bhayandar, in which a non-Maharashtrian was slapped for not speaking Marathi, and the MNS was not allowed to protest. Several other incidents were reported in Virar and Palghar.\nThe lawyers also highlighted that the MNS has subjected citizens from other states to language-related atrocities, beatings and public humiliation, which is “unconstitutional” and disrupts “social harmony”. The complaint also asked authorities to probe the incidents of attacks by MNS workers and demanded that the suspects be booked."

The changes in the service rules will relax the desired experience by two years for the promotions.\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Jogaram Patel said here after the Cabinet meeting that the creation of three more posts in the RPSC would enhance its efficiency and ensure a “smooth and effective” functioning. The RPSC (Conditions of Service) Regulations, 1974, will be amended for the purpose.\nThe demand for reconstituting the RPSC has been raised several times and questions have been raised on its credibility following the continuous incidents of paper leaks in the recruitment exams. The Bharatiya Janata Party government has recently appointed former Director General of Police Utkal Ranjan Sahoo as the Commission’s chairperson.\nMr. Patel said the State Cabinet had decided to give relaxation of two years in the desired experience or service period for giving promotions to the government employees in 2025-26. “The relaxation will be given to the personnel who have not claimed it during the last two years, but no employee will be eligible [for it] during the probation period,” he said.\nMr. Patel was accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister Prem Chand Bairwa and Food & Civil Supplies Minister Sumit Godara at the press conference. The three Ministers announced several decisions of the Cabinet pertaining to new policies in different sectors, evolving Rajasthan as a global medical tourism hub, career advancement scheme for university teachers, and attracting investments to the energy sector.\nThe State Cabinet approved the draft medical value travel policy, which would help establish the State as an “accessible, cost-effective and reliable” destination. Mr. Patel said the policy would promote economic growth, employment generation, and global branding by integrating the health and tourism sectors.\nThe new township policy, the city gas distribution policy and a proposal to establish three joint venture companies in the energy sector were approved at the Cabinet meeting. Mr. Patel said an amendment in the integrated clean energy policy-2024, approved by the Cabinet, would enable the investors to get the land for their projects, for which they signed MoUs in the Rising Rajasthan global investment summit, on easy terms."

    "content": "Director of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP), Dr. Suman Chakraborty, said on Monday (July 14, 2025) thatthe ‘campus mothers’ initiativeis part of a new five-pronged programme geared towards student well-being, and “not a standalone initiative at the expense of professional counselling.”\n“We cannot look at the ‘campus mothers’ initiative in isolation. It is not designed to replace trained psychologists, but to supplement them with a motherly touch. We aim to make student welfare more holistic and not centred only on professional counselling,” he said.\nOn Monday, a day before the institute’s 71st convocation, Dr. Chakraborty announced “SETU” (Support, Empathy, Transformation, and Upliftment), a new, five-pronged mental health framework.\nIt expands student welfare from core psychological counselling to multiple granular, tech enabled, and scientifically designed intervention programmes spanning hostels, gymkhana, academic units etc, he said.\n“In addition to the “campus mothers” initiative, SETU includes an upgraded counselling centre, an AI-driven student welfare app, campus wellness groups, hostel welfare units, and student engagement projects. The framework comprises these five pillars working together”, Dr. Chakraborty said.\nAccording to the Director, the programme was designed by professional psychological experts and technology experts, both from the institute and outside.\nThese developments assume significance in light of multiple suicides and unnatural deaths on the IIT KGP campus in the last few years, with three students passing away this year itself. Addressing past incidents, the Director, on Monday, emphasised on “prevention of unfortunate incidents over being procedurally sound afterwards.”\n“Earlier, student well-being was mainly centred around the counselling centre. Whoever faced any trouble would be directed there. But with a campus that has 20,000 students, the counselling centre alone should not be tasked with their welfare. We must assume that at some point in time, each of those students would require emotional support and that support should be available at all levels,” Dr. Chakraborty said.\nCurrently, the counselling centre has roughly 15 on-campus counsellors. Additionally, a team of external experts will be visiting the institute on July 21 to consult on student welfare issues, he added.\nNotably, as part of SETU, the on-campus counselling centre is being “upgraded” to include 24/7 online counselling, group sessions, stress management workshops, and hostel-level outreach programmes along with one-on-one therapy and psychiatric consultations. The upgrade is in its “advanced stages”.\nThe Director also highlighted the involvement of peers, especially hostel mates, in early identification and intervention as part of the new framework.\n“Hostel peers can play an important role in vigilance, and in identifying and flagging sudden and complex behavioural changes. Students can normalise openness and provide accessible support to each other in ways no top-down model can replicate. In fact, we will have welfare units granulated up to each wing of every hall of residence,” Dr. Chakraborty said.\nThe new SETU framework, which is being developed on “war footing”, is expected to be launched with the arrival of the new batch of students on July 25. The Director said he would give an elaborate presentation on the same to incoming students and guardians.\nDr Chakraborty also addressed allegations and grievances that have cropped up online and in the mental health fraternity against the “campus mothers” programme.\n“This is not a gendered programme. Rather this is a gender balancing programme, to engage more women in student welfare initiatives. Ninety percent of the committees and programmes are already dominated by men,” he said.\nHe also added that the volunteers will be trained by professional psychologists to ensure “ethical, respectful interactions.”\nThe “campus mothers” initiative, newly introduced by IIT KGP and expected to launch on July 25, seeks to involve elder female volunteers from among campus residents to offer informal emotional support to students and add a “motherly touch” to the student welfare framework.\nHowever, it was heavily criticised by mental health professionals for taking a “gendered” approach. Questions were also raised on whether volunteers would practise non-judgment, confidentiality, and other professional counselling ethics.\nThe IIT KGP Director on Monday also announced that a similar, multi-pronged campus security plan is in the works.\n“Campus security not just includes safety of women, but also preventing instances of physical attacks, substance abuse, etc. However, tightening security does not mean harassing people unnecessarily. We are planning to develop similar pillars to bolster campus security, and like in SETU, tech will be used for improved data management. We will prepare for the best, but we cannot guarantee outcomes,” Dr Chakraborty said.\nThis development follows multiple instances of crime against women in educational institutions in the State, namely RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, South Calcutta Law College, and most recently, the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta."

Claiming that the Kondagaon Superintendent of Police (SP) told her that he didn’t want the workers there, the Trinamool MP asked why Indian citizens who were doing legal work needed to leave the State?\nOn these allegations, Kondagaon SP Akshay Kumar toldThe Hinduthat the workers were residing in Kondagaon for the past three months but had not informed the local police station despite repeated announcements by the local police. “Day before yesterday, we found them during patrolling. When we asked for their names and IDs they did not produce and started misbehaving with us. So we prepared a memorandum and produced them before the local SDM (Deputy Collector) and he had proceeded them for preventive detention under Bharatiya Nyay section 128 (Security for good behaviour from suspected persons) for two to three days”.\nHe said they had been let off and it was up to them if they wanted to stay in Kondagaon or go back to West Bengal."

    "content": "The Centre on Monday (July 14, 2025) objected to the maintainability of Popular Front of India’s (PFI) plea against an order upholding the five-year ban imposed on it by the government.\nThe Centre informed a bench of the Delhi High Court which included Chief Justice D.K. Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela that the petition was not maintainable as the tribunal was headed by a sitting high court judge and therefore the order couldn’t be challenged under Article 226 of Constitution of India.\n“I have a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the writ petition. The remedy under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution is not available. The only remedy available is under Article 136 of the Constitution,” said Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju.\nMr. Raju added, “The tribunal was manned by a sitting judge of this high court and a high court judge is not subordinate to this court. Article 227 applies to subordinate courts”.\nThe PFI counsel claimed the issue was with a division bench of the Delhi High Court in a previous case and the petition was therefore maintainable. The court posted the hearing for August 7.\nThe PFI challenged the March 21, 2024 order of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act tribunal confirming the decision by the Centre on September 27, 2022. The court is yet to issue formal notice in the matter.\nThe Centre banned the PFI for five years for its alleged links with global terrorist organisations, such as ISIS, and trying to spread communal hatred in the country."

    "content": "\nMaharashtra’s hospitality sector, consisting of bar and restaurant-based bars, held a Statewide ‘‘No Alcohol’ strike on Monday (July 14, 2025) opposing the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ government’s decision to hike excise duty.\nThe Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) led the strike to counter the Maharashtra government decision to impose a 60% hike in excise duty, a 15% increase in annual FL3 license fees for Financial Year 26, and a 10% VAT on Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) sold at FL3 outlets.\n“The one-day strike to grab the attention of the government and make them understand that the tax hike will make everything expensive, which will affect businesses. Secondly, we want to look at it from the larger perspective of tourism, especially when we have got UNESCO status for so many monuments, State should be competent enough to serve tourist from across the country and from the abroad,” said Pradeep Shetty, member of Hotel And Restaurant Association (Western India) – HRAWI.\nThe duty hike is also seen as a way to fund welfare schemes, including the Ladki Bahin initiative.\nHRAWI also wrote a letter to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, referring to the proposed hike, which may cause a sharp rise in the retail prices of alcoholic beverages. It also mentioned the consequences that may cause financial strain on hospitality businesses already struggling with 10% higher license fees, 10% VAT, and rising operational costs.\n“The annual excise license fees have also been revised upward by 15%, further compounding the burden on the industry. The final price of the product is likely to become the most expensive in the country, making Maharashtra a less competitive destination for tourists, impacting tourism and hospitality,” said Jimmy Shaw, President of HRAWI, in the letter."

    "content": "Bihar Congress on Monday (July 14, 2025) strongly condemned the incident of alleged insult of Tushar Gandhi, the great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi by several people including the Mukhiya of Turkauliya village in East Champaran district.\nMr. Gandhi, who launched the“Badlo Bihar Nai Sarkar”(Change Bihar, New Government) from the Bhitiharwa Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran on Saturday (July 12, 2025), had reached Turkaulia in East Champaran as part of his journey on July 13.\nMukhiya(village head) Vinay Kumar Sah and his supporters allegedly insulted Mr. Gandhi and asked to leave the event. While speaking toThe Hindu, Mr. Gandhi said that he had to face personal attack as well.\nIn the village he reached at the historic Neem tree, a place from where Mahatma Gandhi had once listened to the woes of farmers forced to cultivate indigo. Mr. Gandhi garlanded the spot and recalled the horrors of the past when British landlords used to tie farmers to the tree and beat them. Mahatma had visited this place twice.\nAfter garlanding the place, Mr. Gandhi was invited by theMukhiyato speak in office hall of Gram Panchayat where the argument started when one of his associates raised questions on the Nitish Kumar government and spoke in favour of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress.\nMr. Gandhi was accompanied by farmer leader Dr. Sunilam, socialist thinker Vijay Pratap Singh, Rashtriya Seva Dal activist Allauddin Sheikh, activist Feroze Mithiborwala, Jharkhand’s Praveer Peter, Gujarat’s Mujahid Nafees and many other national and state leaders.\nAccording to a villager, as soon as Mr. Gandhi and his associates started speaking on the frenzy spread in the country, social divisions and political failures of Bihar, theMukhiyaasked him to vacate the stage in a humiliating manner.\nAsked about the incident, Mr. Gandhi said, “We had a plan to make awareness among the people in favour ofMahagathbandhanand thisMukhiyainsisted me to speak over there. When our colleague Vijay Pratap Singh finished his speech, theMukhiyaraised an objection asking why we are doing this. He started shouting at us and then I requested not to shout.”\nHe further said, “I told him to calm down and speak politely but he kept on shouting. Then he said that I do not look like the descendants of Mahatma Gandhi and continue shouting. I asked him not to make any personal comments and if there are some issues, it could be resolved through intellectual talks. However, all my attempts turned futile and he warned us that I cannot do any campaign in his office. Then I have no other option to leave the place.”\nHe also said that villagers also opposed the behaviour of Mukhiya and he addressed the people outside the Panchayat office.\n“When theMukhiyacould not intellectually match, he showed his anger and absurd behaviour which was not acceptable,” Mr. Gandhi asserted.\nBihar Congress State in-charge Krishna Allavaru, state president Rajesh Kumar, leader of the Congress legislative party Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Khan, and leader of the party in the Congress Legislative Council Dr. Madan Mohan Jha jointly attacked the state government.\n“The incident is the murder murder of Gandhi’s ideas. It is not just an insult to a person, but to an idea that was based on truth, non-violence and respect for dissent,” Mr. Allavaru said.\nMr. Khan added that Nitish and Narendra Modijihave thrown Gandhi’s ideas and principles into the dustbin and have just borrowed his glasses for publicity."

To support students, the financial assistance of ₹1,200 for uniforms, shoes, socks, stationery, and study material be transferred directly to the bank accounts of parents of students enrolled in council schools via DBT without delay,” added the official statement.\nUttar Pradesh government initiated a plan to merge schools having enrolment of less than 50 students, with nearby educational facility to make the education system more functional and viable.

According to teacher organizations, the government intends to close about 27,000 schools. The UPA government had introduced the Right to Education Act in the country, under which a school was arranged in every village so that education could be made accessible to children from poor families. If schools are located far from homes, how will small children, especially girls, walk several kilometers to reach school? Obviously, their studies will be disrupted. Why is this right being snatched away from children,” wrote the Congress leader on X.\nShe added, “this order of the BJP government is not only against the right to education but is also against the Dalit, backward, tribal, minority, poor and deprived sections,”.\nUttar Pradesh government initiated a plan to merge schools having enrolment of less than 50 students, with nearby educational facility to make the education system more functional and viable.

In an interview withThe Hindu, he shares his experience navigating through COVID, the programmes he implemented during his tenure and his vision for the institute, as he approaches the end of his tenure on July 19.\nHow would you sum up your tenure at IIMB?\nI became a director when COVID just started. The first two years were focussed on making sure the institute runs smoothly in spite of all the restrictions. There are some good landmarks: all the students graduated on time, people got placed, and we did not have any major disruption in our academic programmes. From 2022 to 2025, we focused on enhancing the impact of our online learning initiative.\nThe second important thing was the AI for managers programme, followed by our decision to offer an under-graduate BBA programme.\n\nI was lucky that during my tenure we also celebrated the golden jubilee of the Institute in 2023, which had a lot of alumni involvement and that provided a good impetus for the alumni chapters globally to get into a better shape.\nWhat shift did COVID bring in the management space both educationally and professionally?\nWe have gone a bit back and forth. Just take a very simple phenomenon like work from home. Clearly, during COVID, work from home was necessary, and many individuals felt that they would like to continue that way. Companies initially were okay with it because they also saw cost savings. But now, companies are wanting to get their employees back to the office, particularly where collaborative work or creative work is required, where interaction is important. The good thing that’s happened, even for IIMB, is that online communication has become accepted as a way of doing things.\nWhich is your favourite programme among those you have implemented?\nThe one which will have the largest long-term impact is our online BBA programme. It is less than a year since we started the programme. But I had the opportunity to interact with many of the students, and many of them would not ordinarily have got the opportunity to have this kind of education. Now, they are able to access it from their home. These programmes don’t show outcomes and impact immediately, but I am willing to take a fairly big bet that in about 10 years, we will start seeing some significant impact coming from these students.\nAnything you wanted to implement, but could not?\nI don’t think there’s anything like that. I think the challenge for us is just to move a little quicker. The interesting thing is that at least the good premier government institutions, like IIMs and IITs and so on, are classified as institutions of national importance. The government gives us full freedom to launch academic programmes in the way we think is best. We have very few restrictions on the way academic programmes are designed unlike a typical university. Where we sometimes get bogged down is on the administrative side of things when it comes to new projects’ construction. Those are the areas where it would be nice if we could move faster.\nWhat are some of the programmes that you introduced to ensure inclusivity on the campus?\nAs an individual, I have been involved in inclusivity on campus in multiple ways for a long time. I was the first chair for diversity and inclusion in the campus. Today, IIMB is largely recognised as one of the best, if not the best campus in terms of support for students with disabilities. There is room for improvement, of course. But still, by Indian standards at least, we have done an excellent job over the last 15 years or so. Again, with this BBA programme, we have a lot of generous scholarships for students from different categories who are coming from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds, or for students with disabilities. In a broad way, all our online education is really an effort at inclusion, because what we are saying is that it doesn’t matter where you are studying or where you are located, you can access the programme.\nWhen you look at IIMB 10 years down the lane, what do you hope remains the same, and what are the changes you would like to see?\nHistorically, IIMB has been quite good at understanding how the environment is changing and responding with new programmes and initiatives. This is what we have been doing quite consistently for at least the last 25 to 30 years. I would definitely hope that that continues.\nWhat would I like to see differently after 10 years? The first thing is that our ability to offer quality undergrad programmes should also be established by that time. The second thing I would like is to see how we can strengthen our international branding visibility. The third thing is that it will be nice to see that that IIMB becomes a leader in integrating technology with teaching and learning so that we are able to offer the most effective learning."

    "content": "At around noon on July 11, businessman Arvind Kumar Jha, 55, was sitting at his two-wheeler accessories shop at the exhibition road in Patna, when he got a call from his home assistant Deepak Kumar, 22, saying thekudawala(municipal sweeper) had given him the electoral enumeration roll form to fill-up. When Mr. Jha came home late at night, he hurriedly filled up his form and submitted it to the same municipal sweeper when he visited his locality the next day.\n“Thekudawalahad distributed the electoral enumeration roll form to everyone in the locality to fill up and almost all of us submitted that form to him next day”, Mr, Jha toldThe Hinduon Tuesday (July 15, 2025). Mr. Jha has been living in a rental flat for decades near the Panchshivmandir(temple) of the bus stand in the Kankerbagh locality of Patna. He, like others in the locality, added that he “neither got any receipt by thekudawala, nor the form bore any bar code (QR code) on it”. Mr. Jha has been a voter at Raghunath Prasad Baika Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (a government school) in the locality. He said he got a photograph of the filed-up form on his mobile phone for “future references and proof”.\nSimilarly, his neighbour Anand Kishore, 58, too is anxious. “I just do not know what value this enumeration roll form carries. Here in a locality of the State capital when akudawaladistributes and collects forms with no receipt or the bar code given on the form, it creates serious doubts in our minds”, said Mr. Anand, an insurance agent.\nAnand Kishore, one of the people in Patna who received an enumeration form from theKudawala. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement\n“We’ll not be surprised when the samekudawala,one day, could be seen selling these forms as is to thekabadiwala(rag picker/ scrap dealer)”, he added with a smile on his face as the other members of the locality nodded in affirmation. Mr. Anand further said that he would go the polling booth to meet the BLO (Booth Level Officer) Manju Devi on Tuesday to “clear the doubt”. Mr. Kishore had received the enumeration roll forms for his family from theKudawalafor “second time” as he had misplaced the form given the first time.\nWhile speaking toThe Hindu,BLO Manju Devi was non-committal. “I’m not aware whether thekudawalais distributing the enumeration form in the locality. “Humko nahi pata hai” (I do not know) she said.\nThe local residents said that Ms. Devi sits at the polling booth in a school and also at a corner place in the same locality everyday where one could go and submit the form. “But, except thekudawala, no one has visited our locality for the electoral enumeration roll form”, they echoed.\n“Leave aside theseemanchal(border) or the remote districts of Bihar where the BLOs allegedly are not reaching out to the residents to distribute the electoral roll enumeration forms as per guidelines of the Election Commission, here in Patnakudawalashave been distributing the form to the residents and collecting it thereafter for submission. What more could be hilarious than this?”, Mr. Kishore wondered adding, “It’s been an unnecessary harassment for common people like us who doesn’t know what is happening. What if we are told at the election booth on the election day  that we had not filled up our form and our names have been deleted from the electoral roll?”, he asked while responding himself quickly, “nothing at all”. “It’s been a mockery of democracy”, quipped Mr. Jha standing by his side.\nAnother resident of the locality Sachin Kumar said, he had filled up the bar coded form by going up to the polling booth. “We as residents, too have some responsibilities to discharge”, he further said with a puckish smile on his bearded face while admitting that he too, like others in the locality, had received the enumeration roll form by thekudawala. “How much the government would do? Its’s our duty too to do something on our own but it takes hours at the polling booth to do the required formalities”, he added with a mock on his face.\nMeanwhile, two BLOs in the State have been booked allegedly for misleading voters and taking bribe from them while discharging their duties on the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. In Gaya district, the BLO Gauri Shankar, an assistant teacher, was accused of taking money from the voters for filling up the enumeration forms at a polling booth and in the Matihani Assembly constituency of Begusarai, a criminal case was registered against BLO Wazahat Ali Farooqui allegedly for giving wrong and misleading information regarding SIR to the voters.\nOut of total 7.89 crore voters in Bihar, the Election Commission said 83.66% enumeration forms have been collected as part of the ongoing SIR till July 14 and so far, 1.59% electors have been found to be deceased, 2.2% permanently shifted and 0.73% enrolled at more than one place. Thus, only 11.82% of electors now remain to submit their filled forms and nearly one lakh BLOs would soon begin their third round of door to door visits in the State.\nThe last date of submission of the filled enumeration forms of electoral roll as part of ongoing SIR in the State is July 25.\nThe State Assembly elections are due in October-November later this year."

    "content": "The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has directed all Central and State government offices toprominently display ‘Sugar and Fat Boards’,visual guides that reveal the sugar and fat content of food items sold within office premises, alongside recommended daily intake levels.\nThe move, backed by the Indian Council of Medical Research–National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR–NIN), is intended as a behavioural nudge to promote healthier eating habits among government employees and visitors.\n“These boards will act as visual cues in public spaces, encouraging people to think before they eat. A person who might have casually eaten three samosas may stop at one after reading the fat content,” said a scientist at ICMR–NIN, which has developed model template for these boards.\nTheconcept was first piloted in schools under CBSE and ICSE,where students were introduced to nutritional displays to raise awareness of sugar and fat intake. With the new directive, this practice is being extended to thousands of government offices across the country.\nAccording to the model boards released by ICMR-NIN, the maximum permissible sugar intake is capped at 25 grams per day, which equals about five teaspoons and the recommended daily limit for visible fat intake (from oil, ghee, butter, etc.) should be restricted to 30 grams per day, equivalent to six teaspoons.\nAt 6 p.m. outside a ‘Haryana Samosa Stall’ in Hyderabad’s Secunderabad area, the daily reality drives home the importance of the health advisories. One man fries samosas in a large black pan over an open flame while another packs them hot for ₹15 per piece.\n“We use about five litres of oil to make 400 samosas in two days. Once all that oil is soaked up, we start with a fresh batch,” said the vendor. A back of the envelope calculation shows each samosa will have 11.3 gm oil. However, at the shop there is no mention of nutritional content, sugar, or fat, only the irresistible aroma of deep-fried indulgence.\nAcross the country, snacks like samosas, jalebis, and vadas are staple offerings, not just at roadside stalls, but in government offices too.\nMedical professionals have praised the government’s push to introduce transparency in public food consumption. “This is a commendable move. People have no idea how much sugar or fat they are consuming in daily snacks. With visible boards, they will be more aware of what they’re putting into their bodies,” said Kiran Madala, a member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Telangana branch.\n“Reused cooking oil leads to the formation of trans fats. These fats significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease,” he warned.\nPresident of the Cardiological Society of India’s Telangana chapter, Gokul Reddy, called the advisory both timely and essential. “The biggest enemies for Indians today are simple sugars and trans fats. These are the silent culprits behind obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. And they are everywhere, in your daily jalebi, your evening samosa,” said Dr Reddy, who practices at Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad.\nHe added that countries like the U.S. have regulated or banned trans fats, while in India they remain freely available, particularly through unregulated street food. “Such nutritional boards could be the first step in making people rethink their food choices,” he said.\nCardiologist busts notions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ habits\nRead information on food labels, make healthy food choices: latest Dietary Guidelines for Indians\nIt’s not just what you eat, when you eat also matters\nPublic health advocates demand warning labels, ban on junk food ads\n43 lakh children below the age of five identified as obese or overweight: official data"

Without any diversionary tactics, the police and the Chief Minister, who is in-charge of the police portfolio, should take action, Mr. Murugan said.\n“The incident shows criminals don’t fear the police. When will the Chief Minister speak about such recurring incidents? The DMK government should immediately conduct an investigation and arrest the culprits,” Mr. Nagendran said in a separate post on X.\nIn a statement, Mr. Vasan said it was concerning that such incidents were happening frequently in the State and sought for a stricter punishment for those involved. He added the State government should undertake continuous monitoring efforts and other measures to ensure that such incidents did not occur."

He took off from Indru Nag Paragliding Site, located in the suburbs of the city, on Sunday (July 13, 2025) in a tandem flight with paraglider pilot Suraj, but their paraglider crashed after a short distance. A video of the crash is circulating on the internet.\nSatish suffered serious injuries in this accident and was brought to Zonal Hospital Dharamshala and later referred to Tanda Medical College, where he died on Monday, police said. Mr. Suraj is still under treatment.\nThe family members of the deceased have been informed about the incident, and the body will be handed over to them after post-mortem, said Kangra Additional Superintendent of Police (SP) Hitesh Lakhanpal.\nThe local station house officer (SHO) has been directed to investigate the case, with the tourism department officials also being asked to look into the matter, he added.\nEarlier, in January this year, a woman tourist, also from Gujarat, identified as Bhavsar Khushi, died as she fell while taking off on a tandem flight. Two more accidents happened in that month, resulting in as many fatalities.\nIn total, over 12 people have died while paragliding in Himachal Pradesh during the past 30 months. However, a majority of deaths were attributed to free fliers who venture into high-risk zones or inner valleys with little knowledge of topography and local wind conditions."

A meeting with the family of the deceased Yemeni national is scheduled on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) at 10 a.m. local time in Yemen.\nMr. Musliar intervened in the case through his friend and renowned Yemeni scholar Sheikh Habib Umar. As per Mr. Umar’s request, a close relative of the deceased and the Chief Justice of Hudaydah State Court have reportedly arrived at Damar, Yemen, to take part in the discussions, said sources close to Mr. Musliar.\nMr. Umar is a member of the Yemen Shura Council and a follower of the Sufi order.\nThe victim’s family has agreed to reconsider their stance following the intervention of Mr. Umar. The discussions are aimed at reaching a final decision on accepting the blood money and finding a reprieve for Nimisha.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Musliar requested the Yemeni government to stay the execution. The Yemeni government, according to sources, is likely to consider this request.\nThe case has been emotionally charged given the tribal and local significance of the incident in Yemen."

    "content": "Ahead of the crucial Chief Minister-level meeting between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, scheduled to be held in Delhi tomorrow in the presence of the Union Jal Shakthi Minister, CR Patil, the Telangana government has refused to discussthe ‘Banakacherla’ project.\nTaking objection to Andhra Pradesh’s proposal to discuss the ‘Banakacherla’ project in the Krishna basin as the single point agenda in the July 16 meeting, the Telangana government wrote a letter to the Centre on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) morning, just 24 hours ahead of the meeting between Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.\nThe Telangana government clarified that there was no need to discuss the Banakacherla project, terming it irrelevant and unsanctioned. The letter pointed out that the Banakacherla project has not received any permissions from key regulatory bodies, such as the GRMB (Godavari River Management Board), CWC (Central Water Commission), and EAC (Expert Appraisal Committee).\nThe Telangana government also highlighted that these agencies have already raised serious objections to the Banakacharla project. Citing these facts, Telangana argued that the project violates all existing laws and tribunal judgments and, therefore, should not be a subject of discussion.\nThe Telangana government also warned that entertaining such proposals would undermine the credibility of the Central Government’s regulatory bodies and also the Centre.\nInstead, the government said that the July 16 meeting should focus on pending and critical issues for which it had already sent a detailed agenda to the Centre. These include clearances and water allocations for projects pending on the Krishna river, recognition of Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi projects as national projects, as previously promised by the Centre.\nOther issues are the allocation of 80 TMC of water for the Pranahita project at Thummadihetti and the approval for the construction of a new project to utilise 200 TMC of floodwaters at Ichchampally. The Telangana government asserted that these issues are longstanding, legitimate, and vital for the equitable sharing of water resources between the two states."

    "content": "The Pantheerankavu police on Tuesday recovered ₹39 lakh buried in a compound near Kaippalam in connection with the mid-day robbery that happened on June 11 near a financial institution at Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode, Kerala.\nShibin Lal, the main accused in the case had confessed that he had buried the money in the plot that was half a kilometre away from his house at Mankavu. The police had discovered the money wrapped in polythene, yet drenched in the rain, and are in the process of confirming the total amount recovered.\nMr. Lal had escaped with a bag containing ₹40 lakh from a bank employee at Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode on June 11. He had fooled the bank into believing that he had to recover the gold worth ₹59 lakh pledged in a financial institution at Pantheerankavu for which he was short of ₹40 lakh and that he would transfer the gold to the bank once recovered.\nAccordingly, a bank official had taken the money to the financial institution to aid Mr. Lal. But the latter snatched the bag and fled the scene on a scooter, which was later found abandoned near the police station. It was also revealed that the receipt for pledging the gold produced by Mr. Lal was fake.\nHe was detained following a flash inspection at one of his suspected hideouts near Tenhipalam in Malappuram two days later. Six others were also arrested later, but the police could not recover more than ₹55,000 from them. The accused initially refused to give out details of the remaining cash."

Thasun Amarasinghe of Indonesia’s Research Centre for Biosystematics and Evolution, Madhurima Das and Rupankar Bhattacharjee of Assam Don Bosco University’s Department of Zoology, and Jayaditya Purkayastha of Help Earth, a biodiversity organisation specialising in reptiles.\nThe new species belongs to theCnemaspis podihunaclade, a group of small, diurnal geckos previously thought to be largely restricted to Sri Lanka. Its discovery in Assam strengthens the evidence for an ancient biogeographic link between Sri Lanka and India’s northeast, reflecting historical faunal exchanges across the Indian subcontinent.\nThe new species is genetically and morphologically distinct from its Sri Lankan relatives, showing significant evolutionary divergence. It is distinguished by its larger body size but with fewer mid-body scale rows, more ventral scale rows across the belly, no tubercles on lower flanks, and three enlarged rows of thigh scales parallel to the enlarged femoral scale row.\nCnemaspis brahmaputrais the second species of the genus Cnemaspis known from the northeastern region. The first,Cnemaspis assamensis, was described in 2000.\nBoth species are members of thepodihunaclade and are restricted to the Brahmaputra River valley. They occur on opposite banks of the river and have significant genetic differences.\n“We decided to name the new species of gecko after the Brahmaputra, as it is a major ecological and cultural artery of northeast India. The river has played a crucial role in shaping the region’s biodiversity, serving as both a geographic barrier and a corridor for evolutionary processes,” Mr. Purkayastha of Help Earth said."

He asked if the department was also aware of the cancellation of the tender.\nHe pointed out that the CEO was reported to have said that the company which submitted the least quoted amount for the bid had sent an email saying it was withdrawing from the process. “Was this e-mail forwarded to the department? Why is the government not implementing the decision taken by the Anert executive committee to fix a basic rate for solar plants? How much funds released by the Centre as subsidy for the project was spent by the State? How much was taken back?” he asked.\nMr. Chennithala also sought to know if the CEO had asked to give tender-related works to a temporary employee who later joined a private consultancy."

    "content": "Congress-led opposition parties have called for an Odisha bandh on July 17, as grief and outrage poured in from all quarters overthe death of a girlwho had set herself on fire after her complaint against a teacher accused of harassment was ignored on the campus of FM Autonomous College in Balasore.\nTaking to social media platform ‘X’ early on Tuesday, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the death of a daughter seeking justice in Odisha amounts to murder by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led system and this courageous student spoke out against sexual harassment, but instead of receiving justice, she was met with threats, harassment, and relentless humiliation.\n“Those who were supposed to protect her were the ones who broke her spirit. As always, the BJP system shielded the accused — and pushed an innocent girl to the point where she set herself on fire. This is not suicide; it is a murder orchestrated by the system,” Mr. Gandhi said.\nHe questioned ‘silence’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying whether it was Odisha or Manipur — daughters of the country were burning, breaking down, and dying.  “The country doesn’t need your silence — it needs answers. India’s daughters need protection and justice,” said Mr. Gandhi in a hard-hitting message.\nFormer Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in similar line saying, “it is even more disturbing to think how a failed system can take someone’s life. The most painful part is that this was not an accident, but rather the result of a system that remained silent instead of helping. Struggling for justice, the girl ultimately closed her eyes.”\n“With great courage, she had written to the college principal, informing them about the sexual harassment she had faced. Even after being ignored by the college authorities, she did not give up. To seek justice, she reached out to the Higher Education Minister, the Chief Minister’s office, and even a Union Minister. She also personally met the Balasore MP to share her plight,” elaborated Mr. Patnaik.\nStating that if even one person had taken responsibility and intervened personally, he pointed out perhaps the girl’s life could have been saved.\n“She did not lose her life solely due to physical trauma but also because of the negligence of the State government, which left her alone in her struggle. The entire sequence of events reveals that this is nothing less than institutional betrayal—a planned injustice,” said the veteran leader.\nOdisha Governor Hari Babu Kambhampati said he was shattered to learn of the untimely loss of a young student from Fakir Mohan Autonomous College.\n“Her passing is not just a tragedy—it is a stark reminder of the urgent need to safeguard our campuses. The law will take its toughest course. Those responsible will face uncompromising punishment,” he said.\nOdisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi said despite the government fulfilling all responsibilities and the relentless efforts of the team of specialist doctors, her life could not be saved.\n“I assure the family of the deceased student that all those guilty in this case will face the stringent punishment as per the law,” Mr. Majhi said.\nEarlier, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee President Bhakta Charan Das along with leaders of Left parties held a press conference and expressed their deep anguish over the death of the girl.\n“We have called for an Odisha bandh on July 17 demanding judicial inquiry and safety of women,” said Suresh Panigrahi, State Secretary of CPI (M).\nMeanwhile, last rites of the girl who succumbed to burn injuries hours afterPresident Droupadi Murmu visited herat AIIMS Bhubaneswar on Monday evening were performed in Bhogarai area of Balasore district. Mr. Murmu was in AIIMS, Bhubaneswar to address the 5thconvocation ceremony of the institute.\n(Those in distress or having suicidal thoughts are encouraged to seek help and counselling by calling the helpline numbers here)"

    "content": "A Division Bench of the Madras High Court has stayed the operation of an order passed by a single judge directing the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai, to reinstate a former employee with back wages. The Bench has also decided to examine in detail as to whether diplomatic missions would fall under the definition of the term ‘industry’ under the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947.\nThe Bench comprising Justices R. Subramanian and K. Surender granted the interim stay after the Deputy High Commission preferred a writ appeal, through its counsel G. Kalyan Jhabak, and contended that the single judge had overlooked the proposition that an Embassy or High Commission could not be termed as an ‘industry’ as it had been defined under Section 2(j) of the I.D. Act.\nThe orders had been passed on a writ petition filed by T. Senthilkumari, who had served as Consular Assistant at the Deputy High Commission of Sri Lanka in Chennai between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Deputy High Court Commission also argued that there was no master-servant relationship between it and the writ petitioner who had sought reinstatement in service and hence the question of reinstatement would not arise at all. Claiming that the petitioner was not terminated at all, the appellant stated that she had worked only in a temporary post and her contractual service had come to an end on December 31, 2018.\nOn the other hand, the single judge, in his February 12 order, had held that foreign diplomatic missions in India could not claim any exemption from following the labour and social security laws of the country, at least with respect to Indians employed in their High Commissions and Consulates here.\nHe stated that the Parliament had enacted the Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, to give a force of law to a convention adopted by India at the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities held in Vienna on April 14, 1961. Article 33 of the Convention clearly states that only foreign nationals serving in a diplomatic mission would be exempt from the social security laws of the receiving State.\n“Therefore, the exemption provided for in the Article is not applicable to the nationals of the receiving State... In respect of such employees to whom the exemption provided in the Article does not apply, the diplomatic agents shall observe obligations which the social security provisions of the receiving State impose upon employers. In such view of the matter, no immunity can be claimed by the management,” the judge had said.\nHe had further held that Indians serving in foreign diplomatic missions here need not obtain the Centre’s permission, under Section 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure, before approaching an industrial tribunal against their employers. Relying upon a 1963 Supreme Court verdict, he had said, industrial tribunals could not be deemed to be a court for the purpose of obtaining the Centre’s express permission before suing a diplomatic mission."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) granted protection from coercive action to acartoonist accused of sharing alleged objectionable cartoonsof Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS workers on social media.\nA bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Aravind Kumar, however, cautioned if he continued to share offensive posts on social media, the state was free to take action against him under law.\nAlso read |Abuse of right to free speech on social media increasing: Supreme Court\n\"We will have to do something about it,\" the bench said as it mulled passing orders on abusive social media posts.\nMiffed over the alleged abusive online posts, it added, \"Log kisi ko bhi, kuch bhi keh dete hain [People say anything to anyone]'.\" \t Cartoonist Hemant Malviya challenged in the apex court a Madhya Pradesh High Court order passed on July 3 refusing to grant him anticipatory bail.\nHe was booked by Lasudiya police station in Indore in May on a complaint filed by lawyer and RSS worker Vinay Joshi.\nMr. Malviya hurt religious sentiments of Hindus and disturbed communal harmony by uploading objectionable material on social media, Mr. Joshi alleged.\nAdvocate Vrinda Grover, representing Mr. Malviya, on July 14 argued the issue related a cartoon made in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"It may be unpalatable. Let me say it is in poor taste. Let me go to that extent. But is it an offence? My lords have said, it can be offensive but it is not an offence. I am simply on law. I am not trying to justify anything,\" she said.\nMs. Grover agreed to delete the alleged offensive post.\n\"Whatever we may do with this case, but this is definitely the case that the freedom of speech and expression is being abused,\" Justice Dhulia then observed.\nAdditional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for Madhya Pradesh, said such \"things\" were repeatedly done.\nWhen Ms. Grover said there should be some maturity, Mr. Nataraj said, \"It is not the question of maturity alone. It is something more.\" \t The FIR mentioned various \"objectionable\" posts, including allegedly inappropriate comments on Lord Shiva as well as cartoons, videos, photographs and comments regarding Modi, RSS workers and others.\nMr. Malviya's lawyer in the high court contended that he only posted a cartoon, but he could not be held responsible for the comments posted on it by other Facebook users.\nThe FIR accused him of posting indecent and objectionable material with the intention of hurting religious sentiments of Hindus and tarnishing the RSS's image.\nThe police invoked Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Sections 196 (acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony between different communities), 299 (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) as well as section 67-A (publishing or transmitting in electronic form any sexually explicit material) of the Information Technology Act against the accused."

    "content": "In a significant development, Karnataka government hasdropped the process of acquisition of 1,777 acres of landin 13 villages of Devanahalli taluk for an aerospace park following resistance by farmers. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15.\nHowever, the Chief Minister has made it clear that the government would acquire property of those farmerswho have volunteered to give up their landfor the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of developed land.\nThe Chief Minister said that there was now a possibility of industrialists, who wanted to set up their establishments in the proposed park, going to neighbouring States. Even then, the government had decided to shelve the land acquisition process in the interest of farmers who were keen that their land should not be acquired, he said.\nThe farmers of Devanahalli taluk were protesting for the last 1,198 days in Channarayapatna demanding withdrawal of the land acquisition process. Pointing out that their land is fertile, and they are earning remunerative prices for their crops due to proximity to markets in Bengaluru, they had questioned the logic of acquiring fertile land for industrial development.\nTheir protest had become a broad-based one with various progressive organisations lending their support, and warning the government of launching a statewide protest if their demands were ignored. In response, the Chief Minister met their representatives in the first week of July and sought some time to examine the legal issues involved. The final meeting (to decide on the issue) took place on July 15."

    "content": "The detention of Bengali-speaking migrant labourers in BJP-ruled states and their profiling as suspected Bangladeshis has ignited a fresh political firestorm in West Bengal, with the ruling TMC reigniting its Bengali identity pitch that had blunted the BJP’s Hindutva juggernaut in the 2021 Assembly polls.\nWith months to go for the 2026 Assembly polls, what began as isolated complaints of harassment of migrant workers has now evolved into a full-blown political flashpoint.\nThe Mamata Banerjee-led TMC is going all guns blazing to turn what was once a socio-economic crisis into an emotive electoral issue, accusing BJP governments in Odisha, Assam, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Gujarat of “institutional and linguistic profiling” and “criminalisation of poverty” under guise of national security.\nFrom branding the crackdown as a “humiliation of Bengalis” to planning massive protest rallies in Kolkata, including a July 16 march to be led by Banerjee herself, the TMC is rekindling the sub-nationalist fervour it used to great effect in 2021 through the slogan ‘Bangla Nijer Meyeke Chaye’ (Bengal wants its own daughter).\nThe flashpoint first emerged in June, when at least seven Bengali-speaking people were pushed back to Bangladesh from Maharashtra and other states, allegedly without proper citizenship verification or intimation to the West Bengal government. They were later repatriated through legal and diplomatic intervention after their Indian citizenship was confirmed.\nLast week, Odisha Police detained 444 workers from various Bengal districts on suspicion of being illegal immigrants, though 50 were later released after submitting documents.\nIn Delhi, electricity and water supply were snapped in Bengali-dominated Jai Hind Colony, following a civil court order amid allegations of power theft, adding further fuel to the fire.\n“There are over 1.5 crore migrant workers in Bengal who live with dignity. But the same cannot be said for BJP-ruled states, where Bengalis are being treated as infiltrators in their own country. Speaking Bengali does not make one Bangladeshi,” said TMC MP Samirul Islam. “Harassment of Bengali workers is proof that this is part of a pattern of hatred towards Bengali-speaking people. Do these migrant labourers now need separate visas to visit BJP-ruled states?” Mr. Islam toldPTI.\nThe Bengal government is now exploring legal options against what it calls the “unconstitutional deportation” of Indian citizens.\nSeizing the moment, the TMC has pivoted its campaign narrative to champion the rights and dignity of Bengali-speaking migrant labourers, an estimated 22.5 lakh of whom work across in construction, brick kilns, factories, and informal sectors across the country.\n“Our people are being treated like infiltrators just because they are poor and speak Bengali,” said senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim.\nTMC minister Manas Bhunia said, “These inhumane acts against Bengali workers reflect BJP’s deep-rooted hatred for Bengalis. People of Bengal will give a befitting reply to this insult in the coming elections.”\nSociologist Supriya Basu called the developments part of an effort to “impose North Indian Hindutva culture on Bengal”. “The BJP is attempting to set up colonies of Uttar Pradesh-style Hindutva in Bengal. Targeting migrants over language is just one manifestation of that push,” she said.\n“The large migrant population could have been an administrative liability, highlighting Bengal’s job crisis. But BJP’s aggressive profiling has flipped the narrative in TMC’s favour,” she added. The BJP has countered TMC’s allegations by citing national security and illegal immigration concerns.\nBJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya claimed over 300 of the 444 detained in Odisha had “fake or unverifiable” documents.\nNewly appointed Bengal BJP chief Samik Bhattacharya went a step further, alleging a deliberate TMC-backed infiltration plan. “These people work in other states and return to Bengal to vote for Mamata Banerjee. This is a demographic and national security threat,” he said.\n“Instead of protecting Indian citizens, the TMC is shielding infiltrators and playing the victimhood card,” said BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.\nWhile the Congress and CPI(M) have condemned the harassment and arbitrary arrests, they have carefully distanced themselves from TMC’s more emotive “Bengali vs outsider” pitch.\n“Migrants labour rights are non-negotiable. But TMC’s rhetoric is aimed at deflecting from its own governance failures,” CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said.\nPolitical analyst Suman Bhattacharya summed it up, “In Bengal, pride often trumps policy. Banerjee knows how to tap into that. TMC, which was being cornered on multiple fronts, has now found a potent counter-narrative through this migrant issue.” \tPolitical scientist Maidul Islam predicted this would become a major political flashpoint in 2026 polls.\nAfter its 2021 triumph, the TMC had tried to rebrand itself as a national party with pan-Indian ambitions, toning down the sub-nationalist plank and inducting non-Bengali MPs like Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad, and Yusuf Pathan.\nBut with Assembly polls looming and the Hindutva narrative gaining steam, the party appears to be returning to its strongest emotional card — Bengali pride.\nWhether the next election will replicate the “Bengali versus outsider” wave of 2021 or produce a more fractured verdict depends on how each party can sustain its competing narratives."

    "content": "The internal strife in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra appeared to reverberate in its Kerala unit, a ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) ally, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nThe NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Maharashtra, has demanded the resignation of two NCP-Sharad Chandra Pawar group legislators aligned with the LDF in Kerala for alleged anti-party activities.\nPraful Patel, NCP-Ajit Pawar faction’s national working president and chairman of the party’s central disciplinary committee, has also put Kerala Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran and Kuttanad MLA Thomas K. Thomas on notice for allegedly pursuing an anti-party line in Kerala. He has disqualified them from the NCP’s primary membership for six years.\nMr. Patel noted that both Mr. Thomas and Mr. Saseendran had won under the unified NCP’s clock symbol in the 2021 Assembly elections in Kerala. Subsequently, in 2023, the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognised the NDA-aligned Ajit Pawar faction as the “original” NCP. He accused the legislators of skipping party meetings and working as a parallel political entity far outside the “authentic” NCP’s ambit.\nMr. Patel warned both the Kerala leaders that the NCP-Ajit Pawar would draw them to court for allegedly violating the provisions of the Anti-Defection Law and the People’s Representation Act.\nMr. Thomas toldThe Hinduthat the NCP’s constitution did not envisage a national working president post as claimed by Mr. Patel. Moreover, the two NCP legislators in Kerala were aligned with Mr. Sharad Pawar. “So where is the question of an NCP split in Kerala?” he added.\nMr. Saseendran stated that the Supreme Court order awarding the NCP name to Mr. Ajit Pawar was an interim order. He said he awaited the apex court’s final decision in the dispute over the NCP symbol and original name.\nThe NCP legislators in Kerala had aligned with the Sharad Pawar faction after the party’s split over Mr. Ajit Pawar’s decision to align with the NDA in Maharashtra in 2023.\nSubsequently, Mr. Saseendran and Mr. Thomas filed affidavits in the Supreme Court declaring their allegiance to Mr. Sharad Pawar. They accused Mr. Ajit Pawar of “abandoning NCP’s founding Gandhian and Ambedkarite values” and swore their commitment to the LDF.\nMeanwhile, Kerala’s Leader of the Opposition V.D. Sastheesan said the LDF had “no ethical compunction in embracing two BJP allies” in Kerala, despite the Communist Party of India (Marxist)‘s [CPI(M)] “grandstanding against the Sangh Parivar.”\nHe said the national leadership of the Janata Dal (Secular), which has two legislators, including Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty, was aligned with the BJP and an NDA ally. “The LDF has lost its moral compass”, he added."

    "content": "The prescribed fees for MBBS in self-financing medical colleges under management and NRI quotas has been increased, with the Selection Committee putting out the revised fee structure for the academic year 2025-2026 as per the order of the Committee on Fixation of Fee in respect of self-financing professional colleges, on Monday.\nAs per the order, the fees for government quota in the 21 self-financing medical colleges were ₹4,35,000 to ₹4,50,000. The management quota fee was fixed at ₹15,00,000, while it was ₹27,00,000 for NRI quota.\nIn its order, the committee - Justice R. Pongiappan is the chairman and P. Senthil Kumar (Health Secretary) is member secretary - said that the fee included tuition fee, admission fee, special fee, laboratory/computer/internet fee, library fee, sports fee, maintenance and amenities fee, extracurricular activities fee and other recurring expenditure.\nManickavel Arumugam, education counsellor, gave a comparison of the increase in fee structure. “The good thing is that the government quota fee in self-financing medical colleges remains untouched. The fee for management quota and NRI quota has been increased. From ₹13,50,000, the management quota fee has been increased to  ₹15,00,000, while for NRI quota, the fee has been increased from ₹24,50,000 to ₹27,00,000,” he said.\n“Another positive aspect is that they have completely done away with the NRI lapsed quota category. So, through this, the NRI quota seats that fall vacant will be added to the management quota,” he added.\nFor State private university medical colleges, the committee noted that four institutions in the category were established recently - during 2022 to 2024 - and the fee was fixed during the same period. So, the committee unanimously decided that except the NRI quota, the fee hike for these institutions pertaining to undergraduate and post graduate medical courses is not necessary at present.\nWhile the fee for government quota in these institutions was ₹5,40,000, it was ₹16,20,000 for management quota and ₹30,00,000 for NRI quota. Mr. Arumugam pointed out that NRI fee has increased from ₹29.4 lakh\nThe committee stated that these fees do not include hostel, transport and mess charges that are optional for students. The institutions were directed to submit the details of these fees to the Selection Committee well in advance before the commencement of counselling. It also directed the institutions not to collect or levy any other recurring or non-recurring fee including capitation fee. In case of any deviation from the order, the committee said it will send a recommendation to the respective authority for withdrawal of approval by the National Medical Commission and disaffiliation by the respective university as well as the imposition of fine.\nHowever, healthcare professionals in the know-how said there is a greater need for the Selection Committee to keep an eye on collection of excess fees from students. “Tamil Nadu has one of the highest fee structures for MBBS in private universities in the country. Some institutions also charge students for the fifth year (house surgeoncy). Some fee heads such as hostel fee remain murky and should be closely monitored for excess fee collection,” a source said."

    "content": "Eggs are being distributed as an additional nutrient along with mid-day meal to students from classes 1 to 10 on six days a week, and bananas are being distributed to students, who do not receive eggs, in all government and aided schools in Karnataka. However, a recent report has found that this distribution is not uniform. The distribution is irregular in over 560 schools.\nWith the help of Azim Premji Foundation for Development (APF), steps were taken to provide eggs for six days a week from September 2024.  The APF inspection team inspected about 762 schools across Karnataka, out of which, the School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) in 568 schools were found to have taken improper decisions regarding the distribution of eggs and bananas.\nThey had  decided to distribute eggs to students three days a week and bananas on the remaining three days. In some other schools, it has been decided to distribute bananas instead of eggs on Mondays and Saturdays. Despite obtaining parental consent, it was found that a unilateral decision had been made to distribute bananas instead of eggs to students  six days a week.\nAccording to the report, the highest number of schools where eggs and bananas are being distributed irregularly is in Tumakuru district — 132 .\nThis is followed by Chikkamagaluru district (74 schools), 56 in Bengaluru Rural district, 50 in Kolar district, 37 in Dakshina Kannada, 36 in Raichur, and 21 schools in Shivamogga, the native district of School Education Minister Madhu Bangarappa.\nThe report has been submitted to the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL).\n“It is not right for SDMCs take a decision to distribute eggs in schools on two or three days instead of six days a week, even with the consent of the parents. SDMCs are not allowed to take such decisions on their own ,” said Director of PM Poshan, Shakti Nirman.\nThe Headmaster of the school, the officials concerned are not paying attention to such cases, and such wrong practices have not been corrected so far, which leads to dereliction of duty and neglect of the interests of the programme.\n“As a result, the nutritional support programme will suffer a serious setback. If this continues, the officers concerned will be held responsible and disciplinary action will be taken,” he added."

Her execution was earlier scheduled for Wednesday (July 16).\nThe government stayed the execution following the intervention of prominent Yemeni Islamic scholar Habib Omar bin Hafizon the request of influential Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar.\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar, in a Facebook post at 2.20 p.m. on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), said the Yemeni government stayed the execution. He posted the government order in Arabic on his Facebook page.\nKanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar thanked everyone who prayed for Nimisha’s life. He said “God’s grace be on them all.”\nMr. Aboobacker Musliar’s last-minute intervention on Sunday sparked a ray of hope as all other efforts to obtain a reprieve for Nimisha had failed.\nHe made the intervention following an appeal by a few politicians led by Congress leader Chandy Oommen.\nSheikh Habib Omar bin Hafiz, a much-respected scholar who is a member of the Yemen Shura Council and a follower of the Sufi order, entrusted his brother’s son Habib Abdurahman Ali Mashoor to initiate talks with Mahdi’s family.\nMr. Mashoor held several rounds of talks with Mahdi’s brother. Hudaida State court chief justice and Yemen Shura Council member too took part in the discussions on the request of Mr. Hafiz.\nSources close to Mr. Aboobacker Musliar said the murder of Mahdi, which took place in 2017, had made a deep emotional impact not only on the family of the deceased but also among the community at Dhamar in Yemen. “That was the reason why none could influence the family so far,” said one of the aides of Mr. Aboobacker Musliar.\nHe said Mahdi’s family could not reject the request of Mr. Hafiz. “Sheikh Habib Omar wields such respect among the people in Yemen. We are all hopeful that Mahdi’s family will forgive Nimisha Priya,” he said."

However, when a health team visited her residence to escort her to the hospital for institutional delivery, she and her family members could not be traced.\nAlthough the family initially maintained contact with staff at the Government Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Bynapuram, they later switched off their mobile phones, and their whereabouts remain unknown. Relatives and neighbours reportedly gave conflicting statements regarding her location.\nDespite multiple visits and sustained efforts by the health team to assure the family that Shevanthi would only be taken to the Thalavadi Government Upgraded PHC—with full transportation and medical support to ensure the safety of both mother and child — the family refused to cooperate or reveal her whereabouts.\nDuring a follow-up visit on Monday (July 14), Village Health Nurse P. Jothi was told by a family member, “Shevanthi is fine, but we do not know where she is.”\nWith all efforts to trace her proving unsuccessful, the health team lodged a complaint at Thalavadi police station. Officers visited the house and conducted inquiries. Police sources said efforts are underway to trace mobile numbers and gather leads through investigation.\nS.

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), while hearing a plea alleging harassment over the feeding of community dogs in Noida, asked the petitioner, \"Why don't you feed them in your own house?\"\nA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta told the petitioner's counsel, \"We should leave every lane, every road open for these large-hearted people? There is all the space for these animals, no space for humans. Why don't you feed them in your own house? Nobody is stopping you.\"\nThe plea related to a March 2025 order of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe petitioner, the counsel said, was subjected to harassment and was unable to feed community dogs in line with the Animal Birth Control Rules.\nRule 20 of the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023 deals with feeding of community animals and puts onus on resident welfare association or apartment owner association or local body's representative of the local area to make necessary arrangements for feeding of community animals residing in the premises or that area.\nThe top court, however, said, \"We give you a suggestion to open a shelter in your own house. Feed every dog in the community in your own house.\"\nThe petitioner's counsel claimed compliance with the rules and said the municipality was creating such places in Greater Noida but not in Noida.\nHe said feeding points could be made at a place not frequented by people.\n\"You go on cycling in the morning?\" the bench asked, \"try doing it and see what happens\".\nWhen the counsel said he goes on morning walks and sees several dogs, the bench said, \"Morning walkers are also at risk. Cycle riders and two-wheelers are at greater risk.\"\nThe bench then tagged the plea with a separate pending plea on a similar issue.\nIn the High Court, the petitioner sought directions to the authorities to implement provisions of the rules with due care and caution keeping in view the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.\n\"While protection of street dogs would be warranted in accordance with the provisions of the applicable statute, at the same time, the authorities will have to bear in mind the concern of common man, such that their movement on streets are not hampered by attacks by these street dogs,\" the High Court said.\nThe High Court, therefore, expected the state authorities to exhibit \"due sensitivity\" to the concerns of the petitioner and the common man on the streets.\nThe High Court said the observation was necessary because there were many instances of attacks by street dogs on people of late, which has resulted in loss of lives and grave inconvenience to pedestrians.\nIt disposed of the plea with a direction to the authorities to ensure that concerns highlighted by the court were duly taken care of and appropriate measures were taken to ensure protection of strays besides ensuring interest of people on the streets was not jeopardised."

If such acts are carried out under RSS patronage, the schools cannot function legally,” he said.\nMr. Sivankutty questioned how the Governor could “support” making children wash feet, calling it “unacceptable and inappropriate” in an educational setting.\nHe further accused the Governor of contributing to administrative paralysis in universities, stating that “the current administrative gridlock is the Governor’s doing.”"

Anand Venkatesh, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), accepted a request made by advocate R. Thirumoorthy for an early hearing of the writ petition filed by Mr. Shanmugam, who had challenged the Revenue department’s July 10 letter, and directed the High Court Registry to list the plea for hearing on Wednesday.\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner stated a single judge at the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, had on January 27, ordered removal of all flagpoles erected by political parties, religious bodies, caste-based associations and others in all public places including lands belonging to the civic bodies, highways and other public institutions.\nEven with respect to erection of flagpoles on private lands, the judge ordered that it could be done so only with permission and directed the State government to frame rules in that regard. Taking exception to such directions, Mr. Shanmugam said, it was an intolerant idea of democracy to remove flag poles.\nContending the CPI(M) had been the revolutionary vanguard of the working class in the country, the petitioner said, it was important both for the party as well as its affiliated body Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) to remain connected with the masses through the pictorial representations on their flags.\nThe petitioner said a Division Bench comprising Justices G.R. Swaminathan and K. Rajasekar had, on June 26, concurred with his contention that the single judge ought not to have passed such orders without affording an opportunity of hearing to the political parties since it violates the principles of natural justice.\nThe Division Bench had alsoreferred the issue to the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Benchwhich could pronounce an authoritative verdict. In the meantime, the single judge continued to monitor the implementation of his direction and about 19 Collectors reported to have removed 100% of flag poles from public places.\nSince he insisted that the poles must be removed from the rest of the districts too, the Revenue department had written a letter to the Collectors of the remaining 19 districts which included Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi and Coimbatore instructing them to remove all flag poles from public places before July 18.\nStating he came to know about the letter only on July 15, Mr. Shanmugam urged the court to quash it and issue a direction to the government officials to not take any coercive action until the issue gets decided by the larger Bench in view of the reference made by the Division Bench."

He urged the Commission to ensure this democratic momentum continues through timely, inclusive, and tech-driven voter roll revisions.\nKey suggestions include annual third-party audits under the CAG, AI-driven de-duplication, Aadhaar-based EPIC number verification, and enhanced public dashboards for voter grievance tracking. The TDP also called for stricter accountability of election officials, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and special enrolment drives for marginalized and migrant populations.\nReferring to the upcoming Special Intensive Revision (SIR), the party emphasized the need for procedural clarity, safeguards against wrongful deletions, and respect for prior voter inclusion. Stressing that the exercise should not be conflated with citizenship verification, the party asked for early initiation of the SIR in Andhra Pradesh."

    "content": "The Congress on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) targetedExternal Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar’s visit to China, with senior leader Rahul Gandhi accusing him of “running fiull blown circus aimed at destroying India’s foreign policy”.\n“I guess the Chinese Foreign Minister will come and apprise Mr. Modi about recent developments in China-India ties. The External Affairs Minister is now running a full-blown circus aimed at destroying India’s foreign policy,” Mr. Gandhi said in a X post, tagging a media report that said Mr.Jaishankar met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and apprised him of latest developmentsin bilateral ties.\nEarlier, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh, issued a statement, questioning Mr Jaishankar’s assertion during his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng on July 14.\nNoting that the External Affairs Minister stated that the India-China bilateral relationship “has been steadily improving since the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan last October” and that “continued normalisation of our ties can produce mutually beneficial outcomes,” Mr. Ramesh sought to remind him of China’s recent positioning with regard to India.\nThe Congress leader stressed that it is essential to build a national consensus on the critical security and economic challenges arising from China’s rise as the world’s leading manufacturing power and its position as the second-largest economy.\n“Perhaps we should remind the EAM of recent developments in bilateral ties since the PM’s last tete-a-tete with President Xi: China gave total support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, turning it into a testing ground for network-centric warfare and weapon systems such as the J-10C fighter and PL-15E air-to-air missile and assorted drones,” he said in a statement.\nHe added that Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Rahul R Singh has stated that India fought three adversaries in Sindoor, including China that gave Pakistan “live inputs” i.e. real time intelligence on Indian military operations and soon they are likely to acquire Chinese J-35 stealth fighters in the near future.\nFurther, Mr. Ramesh argued that China has restricted exports to India of critical materials like rare-earth magnets, speciality fertilisers, and tunnel-boring machines for infrastructure projects.\nImportant sectors like telecoms, pharmaceuticals, and electronics remain critically dependent on Chinese imports, while hundreds of Chinese workers have departed from India’s Foxconn facilities, potentially impeding India’s attempt to become an alternative global supplier of Apple smart phones, he added.\n“When are the External Affairs Minister and his boss the PM going to take the people of India into confidence and hold a detailed debate on China in Parliament — as the Indian National Congress has been calling for since 2020. The INC hope that the Prime Minister will finally agree to such a discussion and break the five-year drought in the forthcoming Monsoon session of Parliament,”Mr Ramesh asked.\nAnd in a separate press conference, Congress social media head Supriya Shrinate said while the EAM reaches out to China, who openly backed Pakistan during Ops Sindoor, not a single terrorist involved in the Pahalgam terror attack has been arrested so far."

    "content": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Atal Incubation Centre (AIC) is planning to go ahead with the next stage larger-scale trials of the indigenously developed mRNA vaccine technology for tacklingChikungunya.\n“Chikungunya is a serious, major debilitating disease in India and it does not yet have a vaccine. We have already demonstrated the ability to make use of mRNA technology to develop vaccines with a ‘Proof of Concept’ (PoC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our lab data trials show our Chikungunya vaccine works,” disclosed AIC-CCMB chief executive officer N. Madhusudhana Rao.\nThe lab experiments conducted on animals showed that the vaccine candidate can produce antibodies against Chikungunya proteins. The next phase will be to infect the animals and check if the virus load has decreased upon injecting the developed vaccine, he explained.\nThe CEO said the institute had also completed initial trials into a potential mRNA vaccine to prevent tuberculosis (TB). But, to go into the next stage of animal trials and more elaborate testing, adequate funding is required, for which different options are being explored.\nVaccines work by preparing and training the immune system to identify disease-causing microorganisms and eliminate them quickly when the system encounters them. In mRNA technology, the host cell’s immune system is trained to evade the real infection by introducing mRNA of an important protein of the microorganism of concern into the host, said Mr. Rao.\nInterestingly, though AIC had developed the PoC for mRNA technology in less than a year and had announced the same two years ago, it did not elicit much response from either the Indian industry or foreign collaborators.\n“There were a few firms which evinced interest in making use of ourmRNA technologyfor vaccine research. But they never came back with concrete proposals. It is an accepted fact that firms spend millions to take licenses from abroad rather than spend a few lakhs on local technology,” said Mr. Rao, a former senior scientist of the CSIR-CCMB.\nComirnaty (by Pfizer) or Spikevax (by Moderna) are based on mRNA technology for COVID and found to be extremely effective. The mRNA technology is considered chemically safe with no long-term challenges. The one developed in AIC-CCMB too is based on the existing mRNA vaccine model. It is as safe as the one approved by the US Food & Drug Administration Agency and had undergone a third party quality check, affirmed the CEO.\nmRNA works much better on viruses and vaccines can be developed for other diseases faster. “It is unfortunate that there are few takers for our technology, though many are trying the same through different platforms. But we want to go ahead with our trials for the potential Chikungunya and TB vaccine candidates now with different partners,” added Mr. Rao."

However, it has been stopped by the DMK government, Mr. Palaniswami charged.\nSimilarly, the DMK government had discontinued several schemes aimed at supporting and helping the farmers to improve productivity. The AIADMK government provided 50% subsidy for women farmers and 40% subsidy for the farmers to modernise agricultural equipment, instruments or machines. To prevent malpractices and ensure transparency, applications were received online to select the beneficiaries. The practice had been stopped now, and the benefits were being passed on to hand-picked farmers.\nMr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government had started a Veterinary College and Research Institute at an estimated budget of ₹1,000 crore in Salem. Some infrastructure of the research institute could not be completed due to the change of government in 2021. Despite his repeated questions in the State Assembly, many facilities have not yet been established, the former Chief Minister charged."

We have big experience to stay in natural, in jungle, and we were not dying, and I did not bring my children, my daughters to die in jungle. They did not feel bad, they were very happy, they swam in waterfall, they lived, had very good place for sleeping, a lot of lessons with art making, we made from clay, we painted, we ate good, I was cooking with gas, very good and tasty food,” she said.\nDismissing suggestions of neglect or danger, she added, “They have everything best, they were happy, and dressed, and sleeping good, and art lessons, and lessons about how to write and read, and they were not dying from hunger, never, everything not true. I have a lot of websites like social net, my profile has a lot of video about our life experience, and a lot of years, different country, like near 20 countries I live, different forest, because we love natural.”\nKutina stated that they had been taken to the hospital, but her children were in perfect health. “Today they brought us to hospital for doctors, it was the first time my daughters were in hospital, they are full of health, not one pain they have, and not one time in their life they were sick.”\nShe also defended the cave they were living in, calling it safe and near a village. “Because we love living natural, it’s just one reason, and this cave was not in like in big big forest, far far from all, and we could probably buy food or anything, it’s very close to village, and it’s very big and beautiful cave, and not small, and it’s like it has window to look to ocean.”\n“It’s not a dangerous place, every tourist three minutes can come at place, and snakes for all time we live, yes we saw a few snakes, but same time in grove, Gokarna grove, people put a photo about snakes come to home, to kitchen, to toilet, to everywhere, it’s same same.”\nRegarding visa issues, Kutina admitted their documents had expired but disputed reports that they had overstayed since 2017. “It is lying, because they found my old passport, and they decide what it’s like, they did not check if it’s real true. We don’t have our visa, valid visa, our visa finished, but it was short time ago. After 2017, we already were in four countries, leave and then come back to India.”\nShe also explained her continued stay in India after her son passed away. “After I had my son, big son, he died, died, and because it happened, and it brought what my new visa, I stayed little more, but not so much, how they tell.”\nKutina said she was born in Russia but hadn’t lived there for 15 years. “After that I was travelling a lot of countries, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Bali, Thailand, Nepal, Ukraine.” Rejecting the narrative that spirituality alone motivated her, she clarified, “It is not about spiritually how they write, it’s not about it, we just like natural because it gives us health... it’s very big health, it’s not like you live in home.”\nShe maintained that her daughters were comfortable and happy. “Very comfortable. I have telegram canal where for all time what we stay in cave, we have photo, video, what we do inside, how we cook tasty food, what we eat, how we make lessons, art, painting and clay... all what we do, you can look at.”"

    "content": "The Madras High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) directed the Centre to come up with a simple mechanism through which women could get their private images and videos removed from the internet and digital platforms, if they had been uploaded surreptitiously by unscrupulous elements, without compromising their identity.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh directed central government senior panel counsel A. Kumaraguru to develop a prototype after taking instructions from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) as well as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on appointing a nodal officer for grievance redressal.\nThe directions were issued on a writ petition filed by a woman advocate whose former partner had recorded their private moments without her knowledge and shared them on social media. The petitioner complained the images and videos had landed on several porn sites too thereby causing great amount of agony to her.\nSenior counsel Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam told the judge though MeitY had complied with an interim order passed by him last week to block the websites in which her client’s images and videos had been displayed, those websites had resurfaced again and continued to display the same images and videos.\nStating the problem with the Internet was the presence of technically sound criminals, the judge said, it was not as if there was no technology available to prevent re-surfacing. “The technology is always there but what is required is the inclination to put it to use for the benefit of the common man,” he added.\nThe judge said, the system was so that it would work with its might and remove all traces from the Internet if the victim happened to be a daughter of a Minister of a judge but it does not show the same eagerness and energy if the victims happen to be common citizens with no connections whatsoever with the mighty and powerful.\nJustice Venkatesh said, technology such as tracing photo DNA must be put to best use so that women do not have to suffer silently because of increasing instances of their private images and videos getting shared on public platforms or being subjected to harassment under the threat of releasing those images in public.\nThe judge also rapped the police for having mentioned the name of the woman advocate in the First Information Report (FIR) registered against her former partner on the basis of a complaint lodged by her. He wondered how the police could be so insensitive to disclose her identity in a public document.\nHe directed the police to redact her name from the FIR forthwith and came down heavily on the police department for having made the victim watch the private images and videos along with seven male police personnel, after she lodged the complaint, in order to identify the perpetrator.\n“Don’t you have women police personnel well versed in cyber crime? Can’t you ask those women personnel to deal with such cases? How can you make the victim sit along with seven male police personnel to watch those videos? Does it not amount to violating her right to dignity?” the judge asked.\nStating investigation in offences against women must be done with a lot of sensitivity, the judge insisted on the appearance of State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah on the next hearing so that necessary instructions could be issued to the police department."

Seeman (60) has approached the Madras High Court against the refusal of the Regional Passport Office (RPO) in Chennai to reissue his lost passport citing a number of criminalcases pending against himas per local police report.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), directed a central government counsel to take notice on behalf of the RPO and accepted a request made by a Tamil Nadu government advocate to grant time till July 22 for filing a status report on behalf of the Inspector of Neelankarai police station in Chennai.\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner stated that he had been facing motivated criminal cases since 2008 and yet he had been visiting many foreign countries to meet the Tamil diaspora. When the RPO refused to reissue Seeman passport with additional pages in 2013, he had approached the High Court and obtained a favourable order.\nHowever, when he planned to visit some neighbouring countries in September 2024, he learnt to have lost his passport somewhere. Immediately, a police complaint was lodged and a Lost Document Report (LDR) was obtained on October 10, 2024. Thereafter, he applied for reissuance of the passport in November 2024.\nThe RPO on January 31, 2025 refused to reissue the passport, the petitioner complained and contended he was not facing any serious charges and there was no likelihood of him absconding or evading the course of justice. Mere pendency of a few “motivated criminal cases” could not be a reason to deny passport, he said."

The collector instructed officials to integrate sports training into the academic routine, identifying students’ interests early and preparing them to compete at national and international levels. She congratulated students who recently won silver and bronze medals in boating competitions held in the Philippines.\nThe Collector highlighted that the state government views education and sports as complementary, and she urged schools to nurture both equally. She called for immediate steps to improve Class 10 results by organising special coaching in subjects like Mathematics and Physics for underperforming students. “Form peer learning groups to help one another. Students must study with passion and lift each other,” she said.\nThe collector instructed schools to prioritise digital classrooms and computer lab use, particularly from Classes 6 to 10. She urged teachers to make use of the TSAT platform to broaden students’ awareness on educational topics."

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), said it was the “Dravidian model of government” that had brought in and implemented several schemes to ameliorate the Adi-Dravidars and Scheduled Tribes in the State’s history. But, these schemes alone were not enough and “we have to go several miles to reach the goals of self-respect and society without discrimination.“\nAfter launching the State-wideUngaludan Stalin(Stalin with you) initiativeand inaugurating thememorial halland statue of former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) presidentL. Elayaperumal, a prominent leader who belonged to the Scheduled Caste, in Chidambaram, Mr. Stalin said the government has nowremoved the word ‘colony’(indicating a habitation of SCs) from official records as it had come to symbolise oppression and carried the connotation of untouchability.\nAs part of these efforts, the government has also removed caste markers and renamed all hostels being run by various departments of the Tamil Nadu government as‘Social justice hostels.’The journey to social liberation is a long one and will take time. But everything will change and Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin will make the change to reach the goals with the path shown by Elayaperumal., he said.\nMr. Stalin said political parties and leaders championing the policies and principles of Dr. Ambedkar, Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi were in one platform and any plan of the “saffron power in Delhi” would not hold good against them.\nPaying rich tributes toElayaperumal, Mr. Stalin said he was in the league of veteran leaders like Iyothee Thass Pandithar, Rettaimalai Srinivasan, M.C. Rajah, N. Sivaraj, L.C. Gurusamy, Swami Sagajanandar, among others who worked for social reforms in the society.\nThe late leader, who worked for the rights of Scheduled Caste community, was agitated on noticing ‘two pot system’ even during his school days and acted against it. Even after joining the army, he flagged the discrimination with superior officers and it was resolved, the Chief Minister said. Mr. Stalin recalled a report tabled by Elayaperumal in Parliament despite an attack on his office was the basis for the enactment of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\nReferring to theUngaludan Stalininitiative, the Chief Minister said a total of 10,000 special camps will be organised across rural and urban areas from today. As many as 46 services from various departments will be made available at the camps. Besides, medical services will be provided at each camp\nMr. Stalin said trained volunteers will visit each household and inform people about the date and location of these camps. They will also explain the various government services being provided, the eligibility criteria and the documents required to avail the services. Women who are eligible but have been left out of theKalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogaican submit their applications at the camp, he said.\nThe Chief Minister also announced that a non-leather footwear manufacturing unit would be set up at Kodukkanpalayam in Cuddalore district at an investment of ₹75 crore. The unit will provide employment for about 12,000 women from the district, he added.\nMinisters M.R.K. Panneerselvam, K.N. Nehru, C.V. Ganesan, E.V. Velu, M.P. Saminathan, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan, MPs M.K. Vishnu Prasad and D. Ravikumar participated."

Services exports rose to $98.1 billion in the first quarter of this financial year, up nearly 11% from the $88.5 billion seen in the same quarter of 2024-25.\nMerchandise exports, however, grew 2% in the April-June 2025 quarter to $112.2 billion. However, Mr. Barthwal emphasised that a large part of this slowdown was due to falling petroleum prices, since India’s non-petroleum exports grew 6% during this period.\nIndia’s total imports grew 4.4% in Q1 of this financial year to $230.6 billion, with merchandise imports growing 4.2% and services imports growing 4.9% during this period."

    "content": "Karnataka Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh on Monday (July 14, 2025) chaired a key review meeting on Namma Metro’s land acquisition proposal in Hebbal fora new depot and multi-modal transport hub, a move that has stirred controversy amid allegations of real estate lobbying.\nThe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) had initially proposed to acquire 45 acres in Hebbal for developing a depot to house trains for the upcoming Phase 3A (Hebbal-Sarjapur line), alongside a comprehensive multi-modal hub with parking and other facilities. However, the corporation has now reportedly reduced its land requirement to just 9 acres.\nThe land in question was initially acquired nearly 20 years ago for a private project. Due to the developer’s failure to make timely payments, it remained under the control of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). BMRCL had originally sought the land from KIADB to facilitate its infrastructure plans.\nSources said that during the high-level meeting chaired by Ms. Rajneesh, BMRCL confirmed a scaled-down land demand. This unexpected shift has raised eyebrows, especially since Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar and Industries Minister M.B. Patil had earlier assured that the land would be dedicated to support Bengaluru’s growing public transport infrastructure.\nFormer minister and Rajajinagar BJP MLA Suresh Kumar has strongly opposed any move to divert the land for private interests. He alleged that the city’s long-term mobility needs were being sidelined in favour of short-term gains."

    "content": "Sunni scholars’ forum Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama and its affiliate organisations have said they will offer practical suggestions related to the additional instructional hours being implemented in State syllabus schools. This was decided at a meeting held here on Tuesday.\nThe Samastha had opposed the additional working hours for Classes VIII to X, 15 minutes each in the morning and afternoon on all days except Fridays, saying it would affect students who attend ‘madrasa’ classes early in the morning. Its leaders told the media on Tuesday that if there was no positive response to their suggestions during the proposed talks with Education department officials, protests would be intensified against the government.\nThe Samastha functionaries pointed out that there had been no response to a memorandum submitted by the organisation ahead of the implementation of the new timings. No talks were held either. The Samastha Kerala Madrasa Management Association subsequently declared that it would hold protests against the government across the State. However, General Education Minister V. Sivankutty spoke to Samastha president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal over phone on July 14 and expressed the government’s willingness to hold talks on the issue.\nM.T. Abdulla Musliyar, general secretary, Samastha Islam Religious Education Board, said that practical suggestions would be put forward during the talks. “If there is no positive response, all Samastha-affiliated organisations will jointly organise intensified protests. There is no going back on this. The government should take the people into confidence while taking decisions. Religion is a form of education and vice-versa. Religious education is a crucial component of Islam, it cannot be set aside,” he said.\nThe new timings were implemented to realise the target of 220 working days and 1,100 instructional hours for Class VIII as per the Right to Education Act and for Classes IX and X as per the Kerala Education Rules. Samastha secretary Umar Faizy Mukkom, central ‘mushawara’ member Bahauddin Nadwi, among others, were present at the press meet."

    "content": "HYDERABAD\nThere is no concept of floodwaters in the country, particularly while giving clearance to irrigation projects by various agencies implementing the river water related laws, and in case any water is referred to with that term it is only imaginary and illusionary as no project is given clearance based on floodwaters.\nThis was stated by former Advisor to the Ministry of Jal Shakti and former Chairman of the Task Force on Interlinking of Rivers Sriram Vedire here on Tuesday. In a presentation made on river water issues, particularly on ‘Godavari Waters: Facts and Figures – A Way Forward for Telugu States’, he stated that surplus water is saving of water by a basin-State in its allocated share at 75% dependability.\nHe explained that the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal had categorised the water in the basin as ‘all waters, remaining waters and specific numbers (waters)‘ — all translated as assured water by the Central Water Commission and the agency (CWC) had assessed the availability of 3,396.9 tmc ft water at 75% dependability, average flows at 4,535.1 tmc ft and the average water above 75% dependability at 1,138.2 tmc ft.\nThe average flows of about 3,000 tmc ft into sea for the last 57 years being cited by Andhra Pradesh, which includes the availability of 1,138.2 tmc ft flows above 75% dependability was mainly due to non-utilisation of assured water by the basin States Chhattisgarh, Telangana (both about 400 tmc ft each), Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha (to some extent) and also due to spillovers due to their limitations in the storage capacity and other operational constraints, Mr. Sriram noted.\nAs a result, the CWC’s assessment of average flows of about 1,138 tmc ft above 75% dependability would not sanctify their utilisation by any basin State as the water flowing downstream, including into sea, could not be differentiated as assured water or average water since several projects operate with varying storage capacities and with different operational protocols, the former MoJS Advisor pointed out.\nComing to the specific and contentious issue of A.P.’s proposal to take up Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project to utilise floodwaters, he observed that if A.P. was allowed to go ahead with the project based on floodwaters for being the terminal State in the basin it would stir up a hornet’s nest as every co-basin would go for new projects based on floodwaters. “It will be an endless game if every State starts building projects using floodwaters,” he said.\nIn case Chhattisgarh plans to utilise its share, it would have to be compensated in a different form or the Godavari-Cauvery Interlinking had to be reworked. He felt that more storage was required in the Godavari Basin for Telangana to utilise its share of water."

    "content": "Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of throwing the State’s higher education sector into total disarray and allowing petty power politics  between the Governor and the government to undermine the future of thousands of students.\nTalking to mediapersons at Kollam on Tuesday, Mr. Satheesan said that under the Left government, almost all of the universities in the State did not have Vice-Chancellors and several colleges did not have Principals. Several postgraduate courses have been discontinued, while several degree courses did not have any takers.\nThousands of certificates are awaiting the signature of the Vice-Chancellors and several new courses, the approval of the government. Most of the students are leaving the State to find better options for higher studies.\nThe students here are the victims of the political games being played by the Raj Bhavan and the government and yet, the State seems least bothered. The aggressive and violent protests being carried out on a daily basis is all because the Senate hall was given on rent for a private function, Mr. Satheesan pointed out.\nHe said that by openly threatening violence against voices of dissent, the State’s ruling front was promoting a dangerous political culture. The Ministers are now threatening their political opponents with dire consequences. The State’s health sector is wallowing in a deep crisis and now the government can have the satisfaction of bringing the higher education sector too to the brink of ruin, Mr. Satheesan said.\nHe alleged that the Chief Minister himself was the biggest Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) agent. He said that the person who secretly  held discussions with the RSS leadership was not V.D. Satheesan but Pinarayi Vijayan. It was Mr. Vijayan himself who won elections in 1977 with the RSS support, he alleged. He also accused Mr. Vijayan of cosying up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership on the sly, all the while watching out for Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on his back\nMr. Satheesan said  that the crisis within the Left front never makes headlines because the media chooses to play it down. A political party which is a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre is a constituent of the Left front  in Kerala, he pointed out.\nHe also accused the media of blowing up issues within the Congress out of proportion while at the same time turning a blind eye to the political violence being promoted openly by the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI)."

    "content": "In a significant development, Karnataka governmenthas dropped the process of acquisition of 1,777 acres of landin 13 villages of Devanahalli taluk for an aerospace park following resistance by farmers. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nMr. Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15. However, he has made it clear that the government would acquire property of those farmers who have volunteered to give up their land for the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of a developed land.\nIn all government and aided schools in Karnataka, eggs are distributed as an additional nutrient along with mid-day meal to students from classes 1 to 10 six days a week, and bananas to those who do not receive eggs. However, of the 762 schools inspected across Karnataka by the Azim Premji Foundation for Development (APF), thedistribution was irregular in 568 schools.\nIt was found that the School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) had decided to distribute eggs to students three days a week and bananas on the remaining days. In some other schools, bananas were being given instead of eggs on Mondays and Saturdays. According to the report, the highest number of schools with irregular distribution was in Tumakuru district — 132.\nClose on the heels of Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Choudhary seeking a probe by Special Investigation Team (SIT) into alleged secret burial of bodies at Dharmasthala over a decade ago, the advocates representing the complainant in the case havealso favoured an SIT probe.\nOn July 15, advocates Ojaswi Gowda and Sachin Deshpande stated: “...We believe an SIT is indeed the most appropriate and necessary mechanism to unearth the truth and deliver justice in this profoundly disturbing case...” The duo stated that the broader advocate community has collectively urged them to press for formation of an SIT ‘under stringent and principled conditions’.\nThe Karnataka governmenttransferred 35 IPS officers, replacing heads of the Bengaluru crime branch and the traffic police department, on July 14. Karthik Reddy replaces M.N. Anucheth as Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Bengaluru. Mr. Anucheth has been posted as Deputy Inspector General of Police, Recruitment.\nThe State government also appointed Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP) for the three newly-created divisions within the Bengaluru police: Narayana M. as DCP Electronics City, Anita Bhimappa Haddannavar as DCP South West, and Nagesh D.L. as DCP North West.\nUnidentified persons locked up the gate of the Panchamasali Peetha, the headquarters of Sri Basava Jayamrutyunjaya Swamy, in Kudala Sangama in Bagalkot district on July 13 night. Iron gates have been put in the front, back and on the way to the staircase. But, the seer, who is touring Vijayapura district, saidhe had no idea who did it, or why.\nThere was a dispute between the seer and Vijayananda Kashappanavar, chairman of the All India Lingayat Panchamasali Trust, over setting up of an alternative religious centre for the community in Kudala Sangama. Amid speculation that the trust had erected the gates to lock out the seer, Mr. Kashappanavar said he had instructed the trust to lock up the premises as a security measure."

    "content": "The BJP will expose the Congress government for the ‘political reservations’ of providing 10% quota to Muslims from within the 42% quota for Backward Classes (BC) and deceiving the latter in the process, said Telangana party president N. Ramchander Rao on Tuesday.\nDuring his presidential address at the State-level workshop for the local body elections held here for the party leaders and attended by Union Minister for Coal & Mines G. Kishan Reddy, MP D.K. Aruna and other top leaders, he pointed out that the party has always been against religious quotas and inserting them along with the BC is definitely an ‘anti-BC’ step.\nMr. Rao claimed that the party was in a good position and well poised to do well in the local body polls as was exemplified in the enthusiastic reception he had receiving during his maiden foray into his ‘home’ district of Nalgonda by different sections of people after he took over as the party chief. For this to translate into votes, the cadre and leaders should combine forces for growth of the party across the State, he said.\nEarlier, continuing his second day of the tour in Suryapet district after spending the night at his native village of Nallabandla Gudem, the BJP chief said he was inclined to create a ‘new political atmosphere’ to make politics ‘abusive-free’ and fight to spread the party ideology for the betterment of people and the State.\nAddressing an Intellectuals meeting at Kodad, he expressed concern that rival political leaders have been indulging in mudslinging against each other and using ‘abusive and unparliamentary language’. “Aggressiveness does not mean that the leader should shred his clothes or squat on the road using abusive language against his rivals. In politics , leaders might have differences on party ideology irrespective of their party affiliations. But it was not wise to indulge in using derogatory words against individuals”, he suggested.\nCalling upon youth to join politics for ‘purifying’ the political atmosphere , the BJP chief has urged social media platforms not to vitiate the political atmosphere by disseminating false and wrong news without ascertaining the facts of the story. Social media platforms should not create ‘social animosity’ and ‘create confusion in the minds of people,” he said."

    "content": "Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has said that the Central government’s duty-free import policy for red gram has pushed Karnataka farmers into distress.\nMr. Kharge has in a post on his X account said that Karnataka is the largest producer of red gram and 40% of this comes from Kalaburagi district. Red gram grown in Kalaburagi is renowned for its superior quality the world over.\nIt has also received GI (Geographical Indication) tag.\nThe Minister emphasized that “the Narendra Modi-led government’s import policy has put our farmers in hardship”.\nIn 2024-25, though farmers across India produced 35 lakh tonnes of red gram, the Centre procured less than 10% of the total cultivation.\nKarnataka produced one lakh tonnes but farmers were forced to sell their produce at ₹6,000 per quintal much less than the minimum support price of ₹7,550. Even this year, red gram price has plummeted to ₹6,250 in the market against the minimum support price of ₹8,000 per quintal, he said.\nThe Minister accused the Centre of choosing to flood the market with cheap, poor quality red gram from other countries abandoning local farmers. Since May 2021, red gram imports have been duty-free. This exemption has been extended until March 2026. In 2024-25, India imported more than 13 lakh tonnes of red gram and MoUs with countries like Mozambique have been signed to import additional two lakh tonnes, he said.\nMr. Kharge noted that even though a Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices report acknowledges that Karnataka demanded minimum support price of ₹16,548 per quintal, with cost of production amounting to ₹11,032 per quintal, the Central government has fixed minimum support price at ₹8,000 per quintal of red gram.\nIt seems that the Union Ministers from Karnataka are more focused on spreading hatred than standing up to protect the interests of the State they represent, Mr. Kharge said."

Their phones, once thought gone for good, were returned by the Kottayam Police at a brief event held at the office of the District Police Chief the other day.\nThe successful recoveries were the result of a joint operation by the Kottayam Cyber Police and the Cyber Cell, who launched a campaign to track mobile phones reported missing from various parts of the district over the past six months. During the event, District Police Chief Shahul Hameed A. personally handed the devices back to their rightful owners.\nWhat made the operation even more remarkable was the reach of the recovery effort as several of these stolen phones were traced to distant States such as Bengal, Assam, and Bihar. From the Government Medical College here alone, 14 phones were retrieved based on individual complaints. Another 10 were recovered from the Nagampadam St. Antony’s Church area.\nSpeaking at the event, the District Police Chief highlighted the importance of timely complaint registration.\n“Losing a mobile phone today is like losing a vital part of your daily life. Our aim is not only to recover the devices but also to build public confidence in the system. We want people to understand that filing a complaint can make a real difference,” he said.\nAccording to the official, the even was organised in a bid to raise awareness, encourage public participation, and  to show that the police take every complaint seriously."

They have not been fair in the inquiry and blamed my daughter, instead of the accused teacher who indulged in sexual and mental harassment of my daughter,” the father said.\nHe claimed that based on the ICC report, the principal told my daughter that she was at fault and may be punished for making a false allegation against the teacher who is the head of the Education department.\nThe second-year Integrated B.Ed student of Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College in Balasore immolated her shortly after coming out of the Principal's chamber.\n“Let the ICC members come under the purview of the investigation,” her father said.\nHe complained against the ICC to Balasore district collector Suryawanshi Mayur Vikas and Superintendent of Police Raj Prasad, who visited the deceased student's residence to handover the state government’s ex-gratia.\nBalasore MP also expressed his concern over the ICC report on her allegation of sexual and mental harassment.\nThe Principal and the accused teacher were both suspended and subsequently arrested.\nMeanwhile, the Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College remained closed for the day, and there was heavy deployment of police force on the campus.\nSeveral student organisations held demonstrations in different parts of Balasore town and demanded justice for the deceased.\nThe student's father, however, urged all not to politicise the matter.\n“My daughter is gone. I appeal to all—please don’t use her for political gain. However, I will keep fighting so that she gets justice,” he said.\nThe father said he received a message from Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi.\n“Sir (the CM) sent me an SMS and assured me of a proper investigation. I have faith in the government, administration, and the rule of law.” He also expressed gratitude for the government’s support for the treatment of his daughter.\n“She was provided with the best medical care at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. The doctors and staff were extremely supportive. I am deeply thankful,” he said.\nThe student's mother said that she now hopes that her daughter’s death will ensure the safety of other female students in colleges and schools.\n“I hope the system will improve following the death of my daughter,” she said.\n(Those in distress or having suicidal thoughts are encouraged to seek help and counselling by calling the helpline numbers here)"

However, he was asked to return at the last minute. The senior IAS officers of Shivamogga district administration stated that they had been instructed not to attend the event.\n“Later, the executive engineer and assistant executive engineers of the PWD also left the venue along with mementos and shawls arranged to felicitate the guests. Somehow, we arranged the mementos with the help of our leaders and managed the event,” said Mr. Raghavendra.\nHe that he met Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari in Delhi on June 25 and informed him that the bridge should be inaugurated at the earliest. The plan was to allow the public to utilise the bridge in the current rainy season itself. “They have suffered without road connectivity all these years. If the water level in the Linganmakki Dam increases by another 10 ft, we could not operate ferries. Considering this situation, the programme was scheduled, and the Chief Minister’s office was also informed well in advance. In fact, I know Mr. Siddaramaiah happily accepted the invitation when the officers met him in this regard. But later he was misled about the event,” he said.\nMr. Raghavendra was of the view if the Chief Minister himself had informed Mr. Jarkiholi to take part in the programme to represent the State government. “Otherwise, Mr. Jarkiholi would not have travelled to Sagar. But he returned without attending the programme. Union Minister Gadkari also felt bad about this development,” he said.\nMr. Raghavendra said that he would accept the Chief Minister’s busy schedule. However, the he was informed in advance, and he could have arranged to take part in it.\nFormer Minister Hartal Halappa alleged that Mr. Madhu Bangarappa had an inferiority complex to attend the programme, as his role in making the bridge happen was nothing. “Out of inferiority complex, he misled the Chief Minister and ensured that the State government boycott the programme. Similarly, Mr. Belur Gopala Krishna often said that the bridge would not become a reality. He also skipped the programme, even after openly announcing that he would definitely take part in it. I don’t know what made him change his decision suddenly,” he said.\nThe Sigandur Chowdeshwari bridge built across Sharavati backwaters in Sagar was inaugurated on Monday. The representatives of the State government skipped the event. Mr. Siddaramaiah has written to the Prime Minister, complaining to him about the violation of protocol in organising the event."

Having served over 14 years of her life sentence, she was deemed eligible for premature release. Subsequently, the Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services referred the matter to the government, paving the way for her release. The decision was made under Article 161 of the Constitution, which grants the Governor the power to remit sentences.\nAn official order, issued by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Bishwanath Sinha, has been forwarded to the State Police Chief, Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services, and the Superintendent of the Women’s Prison in Kannur. Her release is part of a broader recommendation involving 11 inmates proposed for sentence remission.\nSherin’s prison record has not been without controversy. Her tenure in jail included multiple paroles and disciplinary issues. In February, she was accused of assaulting a fellow inmate, and she had previously been transferred from Poojappura and Viyyur prisons."

We need to understand that, unless we study the matter, we will not know whether it’s good or bad. The trials are for research purposes only, and we are not going to recommend that it (GM maize) should be grown commercially or not. It’s for the Central government to take a call. We would be conducting the trials adhering to the guidelines of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and established standards of procedures. It’s a research institute, and it’s our mandate to conduct research,” Mr. Gosal  said.\nThe Coalition for a GM-Free India, a platform advocating safe and sustainable agriculture, has urged the Punjab government to withdraw its No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the trials.\nIn a letter to Punjab Agriculture Minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian, Kavitha Kuruganti, co-convenor of the coalition, said that the State government had an issued order prohibiting the usage of glyphosate, a deadly herbicide with a large body of scientific literature pointing to its negative impacts on human health and the environment.\n“...How can the university experiment with herbicide-tolerant maize that has been modified to withstand the application of glyphosate, which is in itself against the legally-approved label claim for glyphosate in India’s pesticides regulatory regime?” Ms. Kuruganti said.\nIn 2018, the Punjab government banned the sale of glyphosate, a herbicide used extensively in the State to control a wide variety of weeds in almost all crops.\nPointing out that the State government’s NOC would result in national repercussions, Ms. Kuruganti urged the State to prioritise an inquiry into the scientific basis on which such NOCs were being issued, and to immediately withdraw the NOC that has been issued for confined field trials on GM maize."

The pre-feasibility report submitted by A.P. contains critical data gaps and methodological deficiencies, particularly on water availability assumptions and technical feasibility, the Chief Secretary said in his letter.\nFurther, the expert appraisal committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forest had returned the project proposal citing violations of legal and procedural aspects and the GRMB had observed that diversion of 200 tmc ft water from Polavaram for the proposed project would change scope as well as operation schedule of the Polavaram project, which already has unresolved submergence issues in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Telangana.\nStating that the AP’s proposal would undermine the rights of Telangana in Godavari water, he urged the MoJS Secretary to direct CWC to reject the pre-feasibility report of Banalacherla project, prevent A.P. from submitting detailed project report, stop finalising tenders and not to discuss/approve at any forum/by any agency.\nHe also cited the objections raised by the Polavaram Project Authority, GRMB, CWC and EAC of MoEF on A.P.’s proposal. The Chief Secretary, however, welcomed the initiative of the MoJS to convene a meeting to sort out the other outstanding issues, provided the meeting agenda is revised by including the issues raised by Telangana in another letter such as clearance to Godavari Basin projects based on assured water and issues in the Krishna Basin — clearances to the projects proposed in Telangana by the erstwhile A.P."

    "content": "With just months to go for the local body and Assembly elections next year, the Pathanamthitta Government Nursing College is fast emerging as a key political issue in Aranmula, the constituency of Health Minister Veena George.\nNearly a week and a half after students launched a protest against the government’s apathy in fixing issues faced by the institution, the Congress has thrown its weight behind the issue. On Tuesday, the Kerala Students Union (KSU), the party’s student wing, staged a massive protest outside the college. The dharna that followed was inaugurated by MP, Anto Antony, who expressed his willingness to allot a bus to the college through his MP fund.\n“There is no way a government institution like this can function without approval from the Indian Nursing Council. If the Left Democratic Front government is willing to address the shortcomings and complete the required documentation within a set time frame, I am ready to take up the responsibility of securing INC approval within just a month,” said Mr. Antony, also a former parliamentary representative on the council.\nThe college has been in the eye of a storm over its lack of basic amenities and the absence of recognition from the INC. The institution began functioning in 2023 with an initial batch of 60 students under temporary approval from the Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS) and the Kerala Nursing Council. However, even after two years, the college has failed to obtain the mandatory INC recognition, leaving students concerned about the validity of their degrees.\nKerala Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Anish Varikkannamala and KSU district president Allen Geo Michael led the protesters, who began a march from Stadium Junction. On reaching the college entrance, they attempted to break through a police barricade, prompting a police intervention The police used force to disperse the crowd and forcibly relocating the activists to a police bus.\nCurrently operating out of a rented building, the college lacks even fundamental infrastructure, including properly equipped laboratories crucial for clinical training, the students alleged. Despite repeated appeals to the Health Minister and other authorities, no action has been taken. With graduation looming, the students say their futures hang in uncertainty."

According to officials, the Devikulam Girijan Cooperative Society, which is in charge of  ration distribution at Edamalakudy, stopped ration kerosene supply in April 2023.\nKanthiraj, a resident of the Edalipparakkudy tribal settlement, says they have not received kerosene from the ration shop in the past two years. “Kerosene was used for lighting lamps in homes, and after the distribution stopped, families are using solar light, battery torches, and firewood  during night, which has added to our financial burden,“ he says. Sreekrishnan, a resident of the Shedukudy tribal settlement, says the same is the case in his settlement\nResidents say the electrification process has been completed in only three of the 26 settlements in Edamalakkudy.\n“As there is no electricity connection for over 500 families in the settlement, they are eligible for six litre of kerosene every three months. However, the Girijan society stopped  kerosene collection from April 2023 onwards. As per the rule, the licensee must collect the kerosene allotment and ensure distribution to the cardholders,”  says Sanjaynath R., civil supply officer of Devikulam taluk.\n“For the past two years, the society has not collected 14,500 litres of kerosene meant for Edamalakkudy.  Citing that kerosene has not been collected for over two years, the Civil Supplies department has slapped a penalty of ₹9,79,090 on the tribal cooperative society functioning in the area. Though rice and other essential items are provided free of charge, the price of kerosene must be paid for in advance. The price of one litre of kerosene is ₹65,” he says.\nMeanwhile, the State Food Commission intervened to ensure proper ration distribution at Edamalakkudy.\nChairperson Ginu Zacharia Oommen said the commission, on receiving a report from the Idukki district supply officer,  directed the Tribal Welfare department and the Integrated Tribal Development Project office to ensure a proper system for smooth ration distribution in the tribal panchayat."

    "content": "The State government has informed the Kerala High Court that a legislation banning black magic, sorcery and other superstitious practices is under consideration and that the Cabinet had earlier postponed a decision on this due to the ‘legal complexities’ involved.\nBased on this, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Basant Balaji sought details of the ‘legal complexities’ with regard to the legislation. When the government stated that action was hitherto being taken as per the BNS, Police Act, POCSO Act and other legislations, the court sought details like the number of cases registered in this connection during the past five years and the action taken. The case has been posted for hearing on August 5.\nThe government had submitted before the High Court in June that it would not proceed to enact a law to ban such practices, citing a policy decision made by the State Cabinet. This was in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham that sought a law similar to those enacted in Maharashtra and Karnataka to prohibit harmful rituals. The PIL was filed in 2022 in the wake of a ritual human sacrifice of two women in the Pathanamthitta district by three people.\nIn an affidavit filed before a Division Bench of the High Court,  the government had said in June that a draft Bill titled ‘The Kerala Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices, Sorcery and Black Magic Bill, 2022’ had been prepared based on recommendations from the Law Reforms Commission. However, after deliberations, the Council of Ministers decided on July 5, 2023, not to go ahead with the legislation. While the court may have noted the social concerns raised in the PIL, it cannot compel the legislature to pass a law. A writ of mandamus will not lie against the legislature directing it to legislate on a particular subject, the government had submitted in its June affidavit.\nSubsequently, the High Court had asked the State government to clarify on the steps it intended to take to control sorcery and black magic, especially in light of the government’s stand that no legislation was currently under consideration. Stating that the K.T. Thomas Commission report had recommended legislation to curb black magic and related inhuman practices and that the government had not taken any follow up action on the report, the court had in June directed the State to clearly explain how it planned to prevent the practice of black magic and sorcery, even in the absence of a law."

The victim came across the platform through an Instagram advertisement, which led him to engage with individuals posing as ‘trading experts’. After convincing him to register and sign documents digitally, they guided him to invest via credit card payments and bank transfers, claiming the funds were being used to trade in crude oil, precious metals, company stocks like Tesla, and cryptocurrencies.\nTo build trust, the platform initially displayed fake profits. Later, the scammers pressured the victim to deposit more funds to maintain “margin levels” as the market became volatile. This led him to borrow ₹7–8 lakh from Navi, a financial services platform, and pledge his ICICI Prudential Savings Suraksha policy to raise an additional ₹17.5 lakh.\nHe was further asked to deposit a further ₹25–32 lakh. Realising he had been deceived, the victim reported the matter to the national cybercrime helpline (1930). Investigations later revealed that the fraudsters had impersonated representatives of a reputed brokerage firm, Trade Bulls, and used forged documents to run a well-orchestrated scam.\nIn a second incident, a 68-year-old resident of Dar-ul-shifa lost over ₹1.46 lakh after responding to a YouTube advertisement falsely claiming that a ₹20 coin could be sold for ₹50 lakh. Tempted by the offer, the victim called the number provided and was contacted by a man who identified himself as “Raj Gyani.” Claiming to be a collector, the fraudster initially requested ₹1,500 to “create a file” for the transaction, then continued to extract money under various pretexts including documentation and clearance charges.\nTrusting the process, the victim transferred multiple payments totalling ₹1,46,100. When the fraudster demanded an additional ₹1 lakh, the victim realised he had been conned and subsequently reported the fraud to the cybercrime helpline.\nInvestigation is underway."

    "content": "As the Government of Andhra Pradesh prepares to launch another Super Six scheme of free bus travel for women in the State on August 15, deliberations are in progress over the exact mode of implementation.\nWhile Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has indicated that the district will be considered as a unit for implementing the scheme, key stakeholders, including officials of the A.P. State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), have expressed concern over the feasibility of the model.\nAccording to sources in the Transport Department, implementation of the scheme at the district level may lead to operational difficulties, besides complications in route monitoring and enforcement of eligibility across inter-district services.\nA more unified State-wide implementation, the officials feel, will ensure smoother coordination and reduce the risk of misuse, or logistical bottlenecks.\n“Restriction on travel within districts will lead to confusion for women who need to travel across district borders. A uniform policy at the State level will be more inclusive and manageable,” says a senior APSRTC official.\n“A final call on the issue will be taken after the Chief Minister returns from Delhi,” says Transport Minister M. Ramprasad Reddy.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, Mr. Ramprasad Reddy said the government was in the process of procuring 2,000 new buses to augment the existing fleet and support the anticipated surge in passengers once the scheme was launched. “While the buses may not arrive in time for the rollout, they will be inducted into the fleet in a phased manner,” the Minister said.\nCurrently, women commuters comprise 35% of the Occupancy Ratio (OR) in the APSRTC buses as against 65% men. “After rolling out the scheme, the number of women passengers may rise to 65% of the OR,” said the Minister.\nFrom a financial standpoint, the Minister said it would be an annual expenditure of ₹2,000 crore, which was significantly lower than other schemes under the government’s Super Six promises.\nMr. Ramprasad Reddy said the new buses would be operated under the Gross Cost Contract (GCC) model, a framework where private operators supply and maintain buses, while the APSRTC would manage operations and collect revenue.\nHowever, the GCC model is being opposed by the A.P. Public Transport Department Employees’ Unions, whihc fear losing jobs in the future. They have been insisting that the APSRTC operate and maintain the new buses proposed to be included in the fleet.\n“Already, 25% of the buses in the fleet are being operated by private firms. This is a growing concern among the workers in the public transport organisation,” said union State president P. Damodar Rao.\nHe said the existing 11,500 buses in the fleet and 46,000 staff were needed to be augmented before the launch of the scheme. “The corporation already relies on over 5,000 on-call drivers for its day-to-day operations,” he said, indicating the extent of staff crunch."

These ditches constructed beneath bridges ensure smooth flow of water through the channels during the rainy season without flooding the fields, preventing crop damage.\nChief Executive Officer of Bidar Zilla Panchayat Girish Badole has said that the drainage ditch bridges constructed along farm fields will help farmers protect their crops from being damaged by water gushing into fields during the rainy season.\nThe zilla panchayat has been taking many such farmer-centric initiatives under MGNREGA to benefit farmers, Dr. Badole added."

It was identified by the authorities of the Golden Rock Railway Workshop here.  Ashish Sharma, Additional Member (Mechanical Engineering), Railway Board, New Delhi, visited the site on Thursday.\nThe Railway Board nominated the Golden Rock Railway Workshop two months ago to undertake SS-I (Shop Schedule) and other major schedules of the Vande Bharat train sets in the place of Perambur Workshop in Chennai. This is a ₹300-crore project. “If required, more railway land will be utilised,” said the workshop authorities.\nThe workshop has prepared the abstract estimate for the establishment of the new facility and it will be reviewed by the Southern Railway. The estimate includes machinery and plant requirements, civil works, and overhead electrical arrangements required for the maintenance of Vande Bharat coaches, the authorities said.\nBuilt during the British era, the Golden Rock Railway Workshop takes up a variety of tasks such as periodic overhaul of diesel locomotives and passenger coaches, manufacture of wagons and automobile carriers besides undertaking periodic overhauling of steam locomotives operated in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway section.\nSome technical personnel of the workshop were sent to various railway workshops across  the country handling the maintenance of Vande Bharat coaches to gain first hand experience and ascertain the requirements for setting up the facility in Tiruchi.  The Vande Bharat trains have strong safety features, including the Kavach safety system, and can run up to a speed of 160 kmph."

    "content": "Temperatures have continued to soar across Telangana over the past week, with no rainfall recorded during this period, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has confirmed.\nSpeaking to The Hindu, Dharma Raju, scientist from IMD Hyderabad centre attributed the heatwave-like conditions to the absence of atmospheric moisture and the shifting of monsoon systems towards the northeast and northwest regions of the country. “There has been no rain over the last week, which has led to a rise in temperatures. Even coastal cities like Visakhapatnam and Kakinada are seeing temperatures in the range of 36°C to 39°C, with some places even touching 40°C,” the official said.\nIn Telangana, daytime temperatures have hovered around 35°C across many districts. The scientist said that although conditions are otherwise favourable for monsoon activity, there has been a lack of sufficient moisture build-up in the atmosphere over the southern peninsula, including Telangana and the coastal belt.\n“Most weather systems are currently active over north-eastern and north-western India. As a result, despite favourable monsoon conditions, the required atmospheric support to generate rains in our region has been lacking,” the scientist explained.\nHowever, there may be some relief in sight. The IMD has forecast light to moderate rainfall beginning July 17 across isolated parts of Telangana, with the possibility of heavy showers on July 18 and 19. “From July 17 onwards, rainfall activity is expected to pick up and continue until around July 22,” the official added."

    "content": "The number of criminal cases registered under the Protection of Civil Rights Act (PCR Act), 1955, for offences related to “untouchability” has seen a decline, with pendency in courts remaining above 97% and nearly all disposed cases resulting in acquittals, according to the Union government’s 2022 annual report on the implementation of the law. The report was recently made public by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.\nThe Act is intended to define various manifestations of untouchability, including in social and religious spheres, and prescribe penalties. It mandates an annual review report with inputs from States and Union Territories, covering aspects such as case registration, pendency in police and courts, establishment of special courts and police stations, and inter-caste marriage incentives, among others.\nAccording to data provided to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 13 cases were registered under the PCR Act across the country in 2022 — a decline from 24 in 2021 and 25 in 2020. These cases were reported from Jammu and Kashmir (5), Karnataka (5), Maharashtra (2), and Himachal Pradesh (1). Of the 51 cases pending with police during 2022, including those from previous years, chargesheets were filed in 12.\nAlso Read |Untouchability is being practised in the country in myriad ways, says Madras High Court\nThe report also noted that none of the States or Union Territories that submitted data had declared any area within their jurisdiction as “untouchability prone”.\nAt the court level, a total of 1,242 cases were pending trial under the Act. Of the 31 cases disposed of by courts in 2022, one resulted in a conviction, while the remaining 30 ended in acquittals. A review of previous annual reports showed that all 37 PCR Act cases disposed of by courts between 2019 and 2021 also ended in acquittals.\nIn contrast, the number of cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, has risen steadily, with 62,501 cases reported in 2022. Pendency figures under this Act stood at over 17,000 cases with police and over 2.33 lakh with courts across the country.\nA review of past reports in the PCR Act further revealed that the number of cases registered under this law started reducing after 1989, when the Prevention of Atrocities Act was enacted.\nThe 2022 report also documented that 18,936 inter-caste marriage couples were given financial incentives of ₹2.5 lakh each under the PCR Act across 21 States and Union Territories. Maharashtra reported the highest number of beneficiaries at 4,100, followed by Karnataka (3,519) and Tamil Nadu (2,217).\nHowever, several States — including Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand — did not provide data regarding inter-caste marriage incentives. In addition, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Lakshadweep submitted “NIL” information with respect to the implementation of the PCR Act, while Manipur did not submit any input despite repeated reminders."

This facility is already being used by devotees from the State.\nMr. Reddy said that the Peethadhipathi of Sri Raghavendra Swamy Math has told him that he will get a suitable place allotted for the construction of boarding facility at Mantralayam for devotees from Karnataka.\n“The Transport Department operates 200 buses from various parts of the State to Mantralayam and many devotees also travel by trains to the pilgrim place. As more than 60% of devotees among daily visitors to Mantralayam are from Karnataka, the State government is keen on constructing boarding houses there,” Mr. Reddy said.\nMr. Reddy said that in the newly constructed boarding house, a total of 50 rooms are available for devotees from Karnataka. Online booking will be be made available for only 30 rooms and the remaining 20 will be available for direct booking.\n“The rates for occupying a single room by four persons is ₹500 for 12 hours from the booking time. However, ₹1,000 will be charged beyond 12 hours for the same accommodation,” he said.\nThe Tourism Department has been entrusted with the management of the boarding house to ensure high standards. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh recently wrote to the departments concerned asking them to settle land disputes at Mantralayam, Srisailam and Tirupati. This will now enable Karnataka in building more boarding houses for its devotees, he said.\nTourism Commissioner Venkatesh, Deputy Commissioner Nitish K., Deputy Director of Tourism Sri Krishna Shavantageri, Divisional Controller of Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation Chandrasekhar, Kishore Kumar Patil and Anjeneya were present."

The civic body required a nod from the Revenue department as the land was mentioned as ‘puramboke kulam’ (pond) in the basic tax register.\nThough the Union government had allotted a Kendriya Vidyalaya to Kerala in 2019, the project could not take off as expected owing to a delay in identifying suitable land and follow-up measures by various departments.\nThe municipality had agreed to provide 3.6 hectares at Pazhangadchal, Thengode, for setting up the school. The municipal council had earmarked ₹4 crore towards the reclamation of the land.\nThe municipal secretary had written to the taluk surveyor, Kanayannur, on April 9, 2025, requesting the authority to prepare a proper revenue survey sketch of the land. It was mentioned that immediate steps were required owing to the priority accorded to the project. The civic authorities said they had yet to receive the revenue sketch.\nMunicipal chairperson Radhamani Pillai said the Central and State governments should make their positions clear on whether they were keen on realising the project on the land at Thengode. Though the council had earmarked ₹4 crore for reclamation, there has not been much progress as expected, she said.\nThe district administration had informed the Land Revenue Commissioner on June 27, 2023, that the six-acre land at Thengode was suitable for the project. However, the municipality required nod from the Revenue department as the land was mentioned as ‘puramboke kulam’ in the basic tax register. The district authorities had said the nature of the land had to be converted into puramboke for initiating the project."

    "content": "India’s first integrated smart kitchen is serving nutritious food to 2,200 children studying in 12 State-funded schools and bringing smiles on their faces, in Kadapa district.\nThe kitchen, established by the Kadapa district administration, resembles a five-star facility with a state-of-the-art kitchen, a warehouse to store groceries, cutlery to serve meals and also a mini solar power generation unit. The leftover food and vegetable peels are used to generate methane gas through biodegradation.\nIt was set up with ₹10 lakh provided by Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan under the Dokka Seethamma mid-day meal scheme and district development fund. The activities of the integrated kitchen set up under the ‘hub-and-spoke model’ are constantly monitored through a mobile app.\nDistrict Collector Sridhar Cherukuri said: “The kitchen is part of an initiative to improve attendance in schools and enhance the pass percentage by letting the children focus on their studies without any worry about their lunch.”\nIt may be mentioned here that Mr. Pawan Kalyan, who visited Kadapa Municipal Corporation High School in 2024 to attend the first parent teacher meeting, had noticed the difficulties faced by the staff in cooking food using firewood chulahs (traditional stoves).\nWhile having lunch with the children, Mr. Pawan Kalyan had promised to launch a modern kitchen using his personal funds. The Collector immediately took the lead in establishing a modern kitchen with all the required facilities.\nThe menu includes white rice and vegetable curry on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, Pulagam and tamarind rice on Tuesdays and vegetable rice on Thursdays. Eggs are served on all days and these apart, ragi porridge, jaggery Pongal, chikki, greens are also served on select days.\nA class seventh student Kavya Sri expressed that she thoroughly enjoys the various options available on the menu. Similarly, Shaik Mohammad Mahir Basha, a class eighth student, said that he was thrilled to meet his favourite actor Pawan Kalyan last year and thanked him for providing a delightful meal to the students.\nRuth Arogya Mary, English teacher at a Municipal Corporation School, said that there has been a drastic fall in the number of students bringing food carriers from their homes, and credits the improved quality of food served at the school for this change."

    "content": "The 1,198-day protest by farmers from 13 villages in Devanahalli taluk, demanding the withdrawal of the notification for the acquisition of 1,777 acres of farmland for the Aerospace Park, is a landmark struggle considering its seriousness, impact, and the attention it caught beyond Karnataka. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah described it as “historic” whileannouncing the decision to shelve the land acquisition process.\nThough farmers have resisted land acquisition in several places in the State in the past, the resistance by Devananhalli farmers caught the attention mainly for their grit and endurance as they managed to carry on with their protest for a long duration.\nIn fact, it was a protest launched by a group of local farmers who had witnessed how the earlier land acquisition processes had reduced some of the landowners to landless labourers. Commitment to the cause and determination helped them to pull along for such a long time. This became a broad-based struggle later, with several progressive organisations expressing their support for the fight.\nObservers feel that the Devanahalli struggle has gone a long way in creating awareness about the plight of land-losers, particularly as prominent personalities from various walks of life lent their moral support to it. The pressure had started mounting on the Karnataka government ascivil society groups had petitioned the Congress high command, while national-level farmer leaders too had threatened to launch a protest similar to that of the 13-month-long stir held at the borders of New Delhi.\nWhile Mr. Siddaramaiah eventually stood with farmers by announcing complete shelving of the land acquisition process, the struggle is expected to have an impact beyond Devanahalli. Some of the key issues raised, such as the need for a pragmatic approach to land acquisition and a land-use policy for industries to determine the extent of land required for different kinds of industries, among others, are expected to gain currency in the coming days. Those who were part of the struggle feel that a clear policy is the need of the hour, as there has to be a healthy balance between industrial development and agriculture, as industrialisation too is crucial for the State’s development.\nAlso, there is a view that the very concept of “development” should be redefined. This was echoed by farmer leader Chukki Nanjundaswamy, who argued that development cannot be achieved by excluding agriculture and farmers. “Development should be inclusive of farmers and agriculture,” she said, while addressing farmers after the government announced its decision to shelve the land acquisition process in Devanahalli.\nLand acquisition elsewhere in the State, in future, will need special attention on the livelihood of land-losers as the Devanahalli protest and its impact has set a precedent."

The accused, identified as Kunjumon of Kaviyoor, near Thiruvalla, was found to have allowed the minor to drive the vehicles and film the act.\nThe incident came to light during a police inquiry into a harassment complaint against the boy, a Plus Two student from Kuttapuzha. While recording his statement, the student revealed that he had also operated heavy vehicles and posted the footage as  reels on his social media page.\nActing on this information, the Thiruvalla police examined the videos and submitted a report to the Joint RTO, recommending strict action against the vehicle owner. The report, filed by police inspector S. Santosh, noted that such behaviour sends a harmful message to society.\nFollowing a detailed investigation, the Joint RTO found the vehicle owner guilty of permitting a minor to operate heavy machinery. The boy reportedly drove the vehicles at an excavation site in the Kuttoor area with the owner’s consent. The videos have since been deleted from the boy’s social media account."

    "content": "The UK committee of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) on Monday (July 14) opened a full-fledged office, the outfit’s maiden such office abroad, at Southall, West London, with a sizeable concentration of the Indian community.\nIncidentally, when the UK committee was launched at the foundation conference on June 4, 2022, it was also the first international unit of the SFI. The organisation now has a presence in 30 universities across the UK, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with a total of 341 members at last count, with a majority of them being students from Kerala, according to the organisers.\n“We have been able to create a structure under the UK committee in the last three years and have now organisation committees in six cities — London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and Portsmouth — while there are members from even more cities. Incidentally, a majority of our members are first-timers who did not have any previous association with the organisation when they were back home,” said Nikhil Mathew, secretary, UK committee.\nP.S. Sanjeev, SFI Kerala State secretary, said the UK committee opening an office was a significant development, indicating the increasing relevance of the outfit beyond. It was indeed the outfit’s first major office on foreign soil, he said.\nHe added that the organisation’s UK committee primarily intervenes in the issue of racism faced by foreign students from academic and non-teaching staff alike. One of the most important interventions by the UK committee was against the mass failing of 70 students, predominantly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, at a university in Scotland, allegedly on racist grounds.\nHousing is another challenge that students from India are often caught unawares of, thanks to exploitation by agents. The SFI UK committee has identified this as another area for intervention to raise collective awareness about the issue among the student community.\nThe committee is set to host Sambhaji Bhagat, a Dalit activist and revolutionary balladeer, at the University of Edinburgh later this week. “We organise arts and sports fests and academic talks. The idea is to help Indian students remain connected to their cultural roots. We also want to help them deal with emerging problems like the change in immigration laws and increasing difficulty in finding jobs,” said Mr. Mathew, a final-year PhD student in International Development at the University of Edinburgh."

    "content": "HYDERABAD\nWorking president of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) K.T. Rama Rao has expressed anguish over the recurring food poisoning incidents and student deaths in Telangana’s Gurukula (residential) educational institutions.\nHe criticised the government stating that more than a 1,000 food poisoning cases were reported in the residential educational institutions and hostels over the last 20 months affecting thousands of students and leading to the tragic deaths of over 100 students — all due to the criminal negligence of the State government.\nMr. Rama Rao demanded that Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

    "content": "Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday linked educational and social awareness and addiction to social media directly to the community’s political inclusion, citing the ongoing controversy in Bihar over the special intensive revision of electoral rolls.\nMr. Owaisi was speaking at the All India Majsli-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party headquarters where he distributed educational kits to students.\n“If you get addicted to reels, and tomorrow a BLO (Booth Level Officer) comes to your house in the name of intensive revision, how will you respond?” he asked. “Under the pretext of revision, many are being labelled Bangladeshi, Nepali or Myanmarese,” he said.\nCautioning students against addiction to social media, reels in particular. “When you go home, do not waste your time watching reels,” he told children in the audience. “By watching a one-minute or two-minute reel, you will not become a leader, or a scientist, or a schoolteacher, or a doctor, or an engineer. Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered. This, he said, would not only enable participation in democracy but also facilitate defending their rights and shape the nation’s future.\n“In our beloved country, there are big challenges for minorities and especially Muslims. We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

    "content": "The police have arrested four people, including three habitual offenders from Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly making a ransom call to a city businessman posing as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi last week.\nThe suspects have been identified as Rafiq, a Bengaluru businessman, and Amith, Vansh Sachdev, and Sheeshpal Singh, alias Monty, all from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.\nOn July 8, one of the suspects from U.P. called a Bengaluru businessman claiming to be Bishnoi, and threatened to kidnap his son and demanded ₹1 crore. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png",
    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K.

However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

Ramchander Rao for his remarks on the inclusion of Muslims in the Backward Classes (BC) category in the State. He claimed that poor Muslims were first included in the BC category during the British period, adding that Muslims were part of the BCs even in BJP-ruled states.\nSpeaking to the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Tuesday, the Congress MP advised Mr. Ramchander Rao to gain subject knowledge before making such comments. “Ramchander Rao lacks substance, that’s why he is resorting to babbling. It would be better if he gained knowledge on the subject before commenting,” he said.\nMr. Kiran Kumar also alleged that the BJP was attempting to divide people along religious and caste lines. “I hope that at least Ramchander Rao should not do the same thing,” he said, appealing to the BJP for cooperation in the State’s development. He reiterated the Congress government’s commitment to implementing 42% reservations for BCs."

His father, Thotapalli Thirupathi, a farmer, lodged a complaint with the police following the incident.\nAccording to the complainant, Ramakanth had been struggling with financial pressure for several months. He had informed his father on multiple occasions about debts he had incurred through a betting app. Nearly a month ago, Ramakanth told his father that he owed ₹34,000, which had been paid off to an individual named Gnaneshwar. However, Gnaneshwar allegedly continued to demand interest payment.\nThe father further stated that around three months ago, Ramakanth had another debt of ₹10,000. Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment. Later that day, he took the drastic step.\nRamakanth was shifted to a private hospital in Bahadurpally, where he was declared dead. A case was booked, and an investigation is underway.\n(Roshini suicide prevention helpline numbers are: 8142020033/44 and 040 66202000/2001.)"

However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”"

    "content": "With an aim of developing leadership among students at the college and university level, the State government is planning to re-introduce students’ union elections in Karnataka.\nIn his recent interaction with the media about the issue, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the government has plans to reintroduce it.\nAccording to sources from the Karnataka Congress, following the instructions from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Chief Minister is considering the proposal submitted by the National Students’ Union Congress (NSUI) to re-introduce student elections at campuses positively.\nKarnataka had banned elections of student unions from 1989-90 following a few incidents of violence reported at some of the universities during the elections.\nSuch elections are still in effect in universities in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Delhi.\nThe Bangalore University Postgraduate Students’ Union too had recently submitted a request to the Higher Education Minister to reintroduce campus elections.\nSpeaking to the media on Tuesday, Deputy Chief Minister D.K.Shivakumar said: “Mr. Gandhi has instructed us to develop leadership among students. Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

Vinod Kumar and S. Bharath Kumar said on Tuesday that the symbols identical to the BRS election symbol of car was being misused to cut into the votes of BRS. They explained that opponents of BRS were taking advantage of such identical symbols to confuse voters in choosing and recognising the BRS’ car symbol on the ballot papers.\nCandidates who have contested on the identical symbols such as “chapati rollers, camera, ship and a few others got/secured votes more than some of the recognised national parties too. A look at such symbols with the size in which they are displayed on ballot papers/EVM machines clearly show the similarities of the free symbols with the BRS symbol of car.\nIt could be clearly understood as to how candidates getting those symbols had been cutting into BRS votes in the past, affecting the prospects of BRS candidates. They also explained with details how the candidates who were allotted symbols identical to that of BRS have secured considerable number of votes, which otherwise would have been polled to BRS.\nThey also requested the SEC to give an opportunity to the party (BRS) to appear in person to present the case properly to ensure a free and fair elections to the local bodies."

Kameswar Rao, acting Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka, who is also Executive Chairperson of the KSLSA.\nAddressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, the acting Chief Justice said a 28-year-old case of cheating was among the 2,377 old cases, pending for adjudication before various courts for more than 15 years, that were resolved through mutual agreement between the litigants.\nThe Lok Adalat has also resulted in the settlement of 1,756 matrimonial cases, including cases related to domestic violence, besides witnessing the reunion of 331 couples as they decided to leave behind their differences following the conciliation process undertaken by the judges of various family courts.\nThe amicable resolution of cases like cheque dishonour, land acquisition compensation, motor vehicle accident claims, debt recovery, and real estate and consumer disputes, has resulted in the settlement of around ₹2,878 crore, said Mr. Justice Rao.\nThe KSLSA will hold the next Lok Adalat across the State on September 13."

To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933. The identity of the caller will be kept confidential, the release said."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

The belief that these cases are occurring only in Hassan is incorrect.”\nInstead of panicking, people should focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, getting adequate sleep, and exercising regularly. “Only those having symptoms of heart-related illness should go for a medical check-up. Do not rush to hospitals without a reason,” Dr. Patil said.\nThe Minister further noted that lifestyle changes after COVID-19 have led to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. “Dietary habits have changed, and stress levels have increased. We are studying the reasons behind the rise in deaths among the youth,” he said."

Speaking toThe Hindu, teachers, students, parents, and women’s activists had flagged the issue of violation of privacy.\nDeputy Commissioner Gurudatta Hegade has sent a clarification about the previous official memo, mentioning the news report published inThe Hindu. In the circular, dated July 14, he states that the main objectives of the campaign (Mission Suraksha) include ensuring the safety of children by bringing down the cases of child marriage, sexual assault on children, and cases of anaemia among children, and providing counselling on health, hygiene, and handling the menstrual cycle. Managing personal information of students or infringing upon the privacy of students was not the objective of the campaign, he clarified.\nAlong with the circular, senior officers of the departments have also sent a message to the teachers instructing them that there is no need to collect data or maintain a register with regard to the menstrual cycles of students.\nFollowing the news report, many people on social media platforms had expressed shock over the initiative and demanded that it be stopped. Rati Rao E., national president of the All-India Progressive Women’s Association, issued a press release demanding that the collection of data on menstrual cycles be stopped immediately. She stressed the need for launching a scientific awareness campaign on ‘my body, my right’ and also on prevention of sexual harassment, at home and public spaces."

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said. The SIR should not be about verifying citizenship, which is the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.\nThe SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar showed the poll panel had admitted to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party, had been saying — that there was a problem with the electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.\n“If Rahul Gandhi is right, then the ECI should give the Congress the data it has been asking for. First, they should accept this, and then adopt the right method to rectify it,” he said.\n“If they have to revise, it should be done with transparency and given proper time. What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."
