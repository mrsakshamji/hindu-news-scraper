    "content": "The Bombay High Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) rejected and refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) petition alleging that Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi violated the petitioner’s rights by making “immature” remarks about Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The petition sought the court to issue directions to the Congress leader that he should read his petition and learn about Savarkar before making “irresponsible” statements.\nThe 125-page petition, filed by Professor Pankaj K. Phadnis, 65, from Mumbai and the founding president of Abhinav Bharat Congress, a public policy think tank, mentioned history and research work by the petitioner on Savarkar.\nThe petitioner said that Mr. Gandhi, in London in March 2023, had tried to paint Savarkar as someone who takes pleasure in the humiliation of Muslims.\nHe further said that Mr. Gandhi tried to portray Savarkar as a coward and in a derogatory reference at a press conference held on March 25, 2023, where he said, “My name is not Savarkar, I am Gandhi and Gandhi does not make apologies to anyone.”\n“Rahul Gandhi is LoP in Lok Sabha and could well become Prime Minister of India in the future. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to take liberties with facts to denigrate respected leaders of freedom struggle and prevent the young from being in a position to fulfil their fundamental duties. The only way to prevent him from causing harm to the nation is by an expert such as the petitioner to step into the box, depose comprehensive facts about Shri Savarkar and allow himself to be cross examined by Rahul Gandhi to establish facts once and for all,” the petitioner said, asking the court to direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of his petition and learn about Savarkar.\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that the Supreme Court had already dismissed a similar petition filed by Mr. Phadnis and said that the court could not direct Mr. Gandhi to read the contents of the petition and remove his ignorance about Vinayak Savarkar. “In your petition, your prayer is to direct him to personally study and read your petition. How can the court compel him to read your petition? This court cannot issue directions to Rahul Gandhi to study the contents of this petition and remove ignorance about the contribution of Savarkar. We do not know if he will become Prime Minister or not. Do you know that he will become the Prime Minister?“ the Bench noted and disposed of the petition.\nThe court noted that a criminal defamation case had already been filed against Mr. Gandhi by Satyaki Savarkar, grand nephew of Vinayak Savarkar, and that the same was pending before a special MP/MLA Court in Pune."

He also wanted the officials to  create co-working spaces across the 26 district centres for small enterprises coming to the State.\nHe said the proposed Ratan Tata Innovation Hub, which is being developed to foster modern innovation and to promote startups in the State, would be inaugurated soon and asked the officials to take necessary steps to establish regional spoke centres in Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur.\nHe said that in alignment with the Amaravati Quantum Valley, partnerships with companies like TCS, L&T and IBM had already been formed and the officials should finalise essential infrastructure for the partners. Referring to the proposed ‘Drone City’ project at Orvakal in Kurnool district, spanning 400 acres in the coming year, Mr. Lokesh instructed the officials to create an ecosystem to support it.\nHe also wanted wide promotion to the ‘Mana Mitra’ WhatsApp governance services launched by the government. He said that out of the total 702 State services, 535 of them were currently being offered through ‘Mana Mitra’ app. He said steps should be taken to ensure internet connectivity in all the 45,000 government schools and uninterrupted phone connectivity at airports in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajamahendravaram."

    "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) held celebrations in Jammu and Kashmir over the Central Administrative Tribunal’s (CAT) decision to drop Urdu as a mandatory qualification for candidates applying to Naib-Tehsildar posts in the Union Territory.\nA bench of the CAT’s Jammu Bench, comprising Rajinder Dogra and Ram Mohan Johri, on Monday stayed the operation of provisions in the Jammu and Kashmir Revenue (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules of 2009, which stipulated graduation with knowledge of Urdu as a minimum qualification for the post.\nThe tribunal directed the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) to accept applications from candidates with knowledge of any of the five official languages listed in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the order, the JKSSB on Tuesday deferred the process of inviting applications for the posts.\nUnder the Official Languages Act, 2020, enacted during Central rule, Hindi, Kashmiri, English, Dogri, and Urdu were declared as official languages in Jammu and Kashmir. Prior to the reorganisation of the former State in 2019, Urdu was the sole official language.\nCelebrations were held at Srinagar’s Ghanta Ghar by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, where its president Arun Prabhat welcomed the tribunal’s order. He said the government’s earlier notification to continue with Urdu as a mandatory subject was discriminatory.\n“The notice was anti-Constitution. Our Constitution preamble with Article 14 and 16 are for equal opportunity for all and against any discrimination on the basis of colour, creed or caste. The J&K government notice was discriminatory to four out of five languages declared as official languages here,” Mr. Prabhat said.\nReacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and legislator Waheed Ur Rehman Para accused the BJP of politicising the Urdu language and “injecting communal overtones into the discourse around Jammu and Kashmir’s linguistic heritage”.\n“BJP’s attempt to view Urdu through a communal lens marks a dangerous and disgraceful new low in our political discourse in J&K. Urdu is not a symbol of any religion but the throbbing pulse of Jammu & Kashmir’s identity, echoing collective memories and soulful struggles of our people over centuries,” Mr. Para said in a post on social media platform X.\nHe said that Urdu is the language of poets, courts, revenue offices, administration, and everyday life in Jammu and Kashmir. “Even more disturbing is the CAT’s order staying the requirement of basic Urdu knowledge for the Naib Tehsildar exam — a signal that judicial forums too are beginning to cave under political pressure,” he added.\nThe PDP, Mr. Para said, stood for the preservation of the region’s linguistic and cultural identity. “Urdu must be preserved, not just as a language, but as an embodiment of our shared heritage, administrative continuity & cultural essence that binds every region of J&K together.”"

    "content": "Air India will partially resume international flights from August 1, after the “safety pause” necessitated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 fleet following thedeadly crash of AI-171 on June 12. A full restoration of flights across its global network is planned from October 1, the airline said in a press statement.\nThe airline also announced that it will be moving three out of its five weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London’s Gatwick airport to the British capital’s Heathrow airport instead, for a period of two months from August 1.\nBetween July 16 and August 1, the airline will restore seven flights to destinations such as London, Zurich, Tokyo, and Seoul. During the same period, the airline will operate 13 fewer flights to European destinations as compared to its full schedule, and 20 fewer flights to the U.S. and Canada. Destinations in Australia will continue to see four fewer flights. Some services to London and Singapore will remain suspended till September 30.\nThe DGCA had ordered enhanced checks for Air India’s 33 Boeing 787 aircraft, which had led to long delays and cancellations of flights, inviting flak from passengers.\nFollowing the DGCA’s intervention, Air India announced it was curtailing 15% of its internatIonal flights due to disruptions caused due to a combination of factors, including airspace closures over Pakistan and the Middle East. The cut was announced for a period of a month, and later extended until the end of July.\nTuesday’s (July 15, 2025) announcement also follows last week’s interim probe report into the June 12 crash that killed 260 people. The report did not recommend any extra measures for either the aircraft type or its engines.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson told airline employees on an internal platform that all Boeing 787s had been checked since the crash, and were found “fit-to-fly”. Since the interim report found that the lock on the switches that supply fuel to the two engines had moved or “transitioned” before both engines shut down, the airline has also started inspecting the lock feature for the fuel control switches. This exercise has been carried out for 50% of Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet.\nOn Monday (July 14, 2025), the DGCA ordered all airlines with Boeing aircraft to carry out this inspection by July 21."

    "content": "The unemployment rate (UR) among people aged 15 and above has remained the same at 5.6% in May and June 2025, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation here on Tuesday (July 15, 2025).\nWomen’s participation in labour force, both in urban and rural areas, decreased by one percentage point in June compared with May. The government said there is a “marginal decline” in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men too.\nThe Ministry said the LFPR in current weekly status (CWS) among all persons aged 15 and above was 54.2 % during June this year as compared to 54.8% during May 2025. “The LFPR in rural areas was 56.1% and LFPR in urban areas was 50.4% during June 2025 for persons of the same age group,” the Ministry said. The LFPR for males aged 15 and above in rural and urban areas were respectively 78.1% and 75% during June 2025, and it marked a marginal decline from the corresponding LFPR estimates of 78.3% and 75.1% respectively for rural and urban areas during May 2025.\nFor females, the LFPR for age 15 years and above for rural areas was 35.2% in June 2025. This was 36.9% in May and 38.2% in April. In urban areas, the LFPR for females aged above 15 was 25% in June. It was 25.3% in May. For females of all age groups in both rural and urban areas, the LFPR was 24.5% in June and it was 25.5% in May.\nThe unemployment rate for females and males of all ages above 15 was 5.6%. While for men, the rate remained same as of May, for females there was a decrease in UR by 0.1 percentage point. While the rural unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the urban unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points between May and June.\nThe worker population ratio (WPR) for people of all ages above 15 in both urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 38.7% compared to 39% in May.\nThe Union Government said the marginal decline in LFPR and WPR in June was largely influenced by seasonal agricultural patterns, intense summer heat limiting outdoor physical work, and a shift of some unpaid helpers, particularly from higher-income rural households, towards domestic chores. It said the share of rural female workers in agriculture dropped from 70.2% in May to 69.8% in June, indicating the reduced need for agricultural engagement among women, “perhaps due to a decline in rural inflation”.\nThe Ministry had started releasing monthly figures of employment and unemployment data since April for a better perspective of the situation. “The number of households surveyed was 89,493 (49,335 in rural areas and 40,158 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 3,80,538 (2,17,251 in rural areas and 1,63,287 in urban areas),” the Ministry said."

Mr. Rana has not yet attained the age of 65.\nHowever, Mr. Rana’s counsel, advocate Piyush Sachdeva, submitted that the accused is 64 years and six months old and suffers from medical conditions that warrant special consideration.\nThe NIA informed the court that it has submitted Mr. Rana’s complete medical history to the jail authorities.\nThe matter has been posted for further hearing on July 25.\nExtradited from the United States on April 10, Mr. Rana, 64, is facing trial in connection with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which left more than 166 people dead.\nThe NIA, which is investigating the case, has charged Mr. Rana with conspiring in the attacks along with his associate David Headley. Headley, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, is accused of conducting planning and reconnaissance for the attacks at the behest of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed."

He also favoured reservation in private sector.\n“We must demand political representation and ensure that backward classes will have a proportional voice in all decision-making bodies. Economic opportunities should be expanded through reservation in private sector jobs, government promotions and contracts, financial support and schemes, and access to markets,” he told the delegates at the first meeting of the council here on Tuesday.\n“Awareness campaigns to combat discrimination and ensure social integration, build a strong sense of backward class consciousness, which brings awareness of social reality, strength in numbers and right to equality. This political awakening will fuel aspiration, solidarity and long- term change,” he said, outlining the responsibility for the council, which comprises 24 leaders, including former Chief Ministers, former Ministers and Members of Parliament.\nThe council has been set by the AICC to deliberate and strategise party’s response in the OBC politics across the country and woo back the OBC voters to the party fold.\nMr. Siddaramaiah, a member of the panel, said the Council must become a platform that transforms socio economic and educational caste census from a political debate into constitutional necessity. “It should provide space that ensures backward classes voices shape policy, not just manifestos and a force that mobilises intellectual capital, youth energy and grassroots strength to build leadership emerging from the oppressed classes.” He said the council is not a formality, but “soul of India’s social justice movement... We should remind the country that AHINDA is not a vote bank, but it is the voice of India’s conscience.”\nAttacking the BJP and Sangha Parivar, the Chief Minister said, “They may polarise India through caste division, but we will win back India through social unity and constitutional justice. They treat OBCs as mere symbols, We uplift them as equals.”  At every step, BJP opposed Congress’s social justice efforts not just politically, but ideologically too, undermining equity and resisting OBC empowerment out of discomfort for true backward class advancement, he added.\nAmong those present in the meeting, which will continue its deliberations on Wednesday, were Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanswamy. The council will deliberate on the national caste census, a demand by the Congress and OBC oriented welfare programmes in the country."

The protest is to highlight the DMK government’s failure to implement 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Incidentally, Dr. Ramadoss’s residence is located at Thailapuram in Villupuram district.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, sources close to Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani  said fatigue had set in among the party cadre because of the feud, and this could affect the party’s performance in the 2026 Assembly election.\n“However, the protest against the DMK government would be huge. In 1995, Dr. Ramadoss declared that the then DMK president, M.  Karunanidhi, would be the next Chief Minister and presented him with a yellow shawl at Villupuram. Thirty-five years later, his son Dr. Anbumani  will demand the ouster of the DMK and Karunanidhi’s son, M.K. Stalin, from power for their failure to implement the internal reservation for the Vanniyars,” PMK spokesperson K. Balu said.\nAnother senior PMK leader close to Dr. Ramadoss said he hoped Dr. Anbumani would step back. “Who is going to be the biggest loser if the party’s vote share dwindles and voters switch to other parties? It is going to be Dr. Anbumani who is the future of this party,” he said."

This was 1,579 cusecs higher than Monday’s release of 50,369 cusecs.\nFor the first time during this monsoon, Maharashtra released 5,500 cusecs of water from the Koyna dam into the river Krishna on Tuesday.\nThe dam authorities managing the inflow are trying to balance the impounded quantity of water. The dam recorded an inflow of 25,478 cusecs. The dam has 76.5 tmcft of water or 72% of the full reservoir level.\nOfficials are not impounding water in the Hipparagi barrage. The dam recorded an inflow of 50,460 cusecs and an outflow of 49,810 cusecs. As inflow is high in the Krishna, the river is in a free flow state, hence storage is not done in the monsoon period, officers said in a release.\nThe Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir on the Krishna at Almatti recorded an inflow of 42,577 cusecs and an outflow of 25,000 cusecs.\nThe dam has 97.13 tmcft of water or 78.92% of the full reservoir level.\nThe Narayanpur dam recorded an inflow of 25,000 cusecs and an outflow of 3,000 cusecs. The dam has 30 tmcft of water or 90% of the full capacity."

Besides there would be biannual review meetings, annual reports, and a real-time data dashboard and the field sites will be spread across over 15 forest divisions and protected areas in southern Karnataka.\n“Modern technology will be used to protect elephant corridors and habitats in order to control the increasing elephant-human conflict in the State and protect the crops of farmers on the edge of the forest areas,” said Environment Minister Eshwar Khandre.\nHe further said that elephant-human conflict is common in Hassan and Kodagu, causing loss of life and crop damage, and the department is taking all possible steps to control it."

    "content": "To tap into the expertise of retired scientists, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) — the newly constituted body for funding scientific research — has announced the Prime Minister Professorships.\nEach selected Professor will receive an annual fellowship of ₹30 lakh, along with ₹24 lakh as a research grant for consumables, domestic travel, contingencies, equipment and other expenses. An overhead of ₹1 lakh per annum has also been provisioned.\nThe Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), now subsumed under the ANRF, had earlier administered the SERB Distinguished Fellowship for retired scientists. That scheme offered a research grant of ₹20 lakh per annum and a monthly fellowship of ₹60,000.\nUnlike previous fellowships, the new initiative is also open to overseas scientists, including Non-Resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin, and Overseas Citizens of India. Additionally, professionals from industry and experienced Professors of Practice with a “distinguished record” of research and innovation are eligible to apply.\nA key distinction of the new programme is that recipients must be based at State universities that qualify as “spoke” institutions under Category A of the recently introduced Promoting Advanced and Inclusive Research (PAIR) programme of the ANRF.\nThe PAIR initiative links universities with nascent research ecosystems to top-tier institutions in a mentorship arrangement. Select Central Universities, National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been classified as “spoke” institutions, while institutions ranked 25 or below in the National Institutional Ranking Framework are designated as “hubs”.\nThe selected Professors are expected to relocate, if necessary, to the host university and provide “sustained academic and research support to faculty and students in institutions with emerging research capacity”.\n“Applicants with strong research credentials must be actively involved in research and innovation activities, and demonstrate a strong commitment to mentor faculty at the eligible State universities where research and innovation is still at a nascent stage,” stated a note from the ANRF announcing the fellowship."

    "content": "ThePahalgam terrorist attackof April 22 was carried out to hurt theJammu and Kashmireconomy and to “sow a religious divide”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (SCO-CFM) meeting in China, where other SCO Ministers — including Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar — were present, and called for support to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nOn Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Jaishankar and the other SCO Ministers from Russia, Iran, Belarus and Central Asian states called on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) before proceeding to the SCO meeting in Tianjin by train. The External Affairs Minister also held bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, both of whom he met earlier this month at the BRICS summit in Brazil.\nMr. Jaishankar’s comments came a month after the SCO Defence Ministers’ meeting failed to issue a joint statement following differences over the references to terrorism. While no statement was issued after the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting as well, officials said it was not the practice to do so, as the Foreign Ministers were normally tasked with finalising the agenda for the Summit of leaders on August 31-September 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Tianjin for the summit, which would be his first such visit since the Galwan clashes in 2020.\n“The three evils that SCO was founded to combat were terrorism, separatism and extremism,” Mr. Jaishankar said during his speech at the meeting, where he referred to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 men, mostly tourists, were religiously identified and killed. “It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide”, he added, calling for the SCO to take an “uncompromising position” on the challenge of terrorism, and referring to the UN Security Council resolution issued in April about the attack.\nA press statement issued by the SCO Secretariat said that the members “exchanged views on key areas of SCO cooperation, including political, economic, trade, cultural issues and key international and regional issues”, but did not specifically mention terrorism.\nMr. Jaishankar’s meeting with Mr. Xi came a day after he held bilateral talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he hailed the “continued normalisation” of India-China relations. The Minister said that he had apprised President Xi of recent developments in bilateral relations. “I value the guidance of our leaders in that regard”, he posted on X, referring to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi.\nChinese state media reported that Mr. Xi had told SCO Ministers that the organisation must play a “more proactive role” to ensure stability in a “turbulent and changing international landscape”. Most SCO countries, especially China and India, would be affected if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned law imposing 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil and sanctioned products.\nIn his comments during the SCO-CFM, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mr. Dar did not refer to the issue of terrorism. In a post on social media, Mr. Dar said that he “underscored the importance of upholding international law and implementing relevant UNSC resolutions to resolve longstanding disputes”, at the meeting and that Pakistan sought peace with “all its neighbours”.\nReferring to Afghanistan, which is an SCO observer state but has not been invited since 2021 when the Taliban regime took control of Kabul, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “compulsions of regional stability are buttressed by [India’s] longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people” and called for SCO members to increase development assistance.\nTaking a swipe at Pakistan for closing transit for India-Afghanistan trade, Mr. Jaishankar said that the “lack of assured transit within the SCO space…undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas”, and advocated for the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that runs through Iran."

Usha Raja Nanthini, Professor and Head, Biotechnology Department, has filed 150 separate applications under industrial design for jewellery made with naturally-occurring seeds. The project, funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), aims to train the tribespeople in jewellery-making and help them market their products through a website.\nFive tribal women have come together to establish a company, Tulir, and registered it as a micro, small and medium enterprise. The website is being designed and will sell honey, nutmeg, lichens, benzoin resin (sambrani), and myrobalan (kadukkai), besides jewellery.\nMs. Usha said, “They live in 15-20 hamlets spread over Palani Hills and their population according to the 2011 Census was around 6,000. The children rarely go to school and they live a simple life collecting non-timber forest produce.”\nWhile being on a project to analyse different species of eucalyptus for anti-fungal properties, Ms. Usha and her team came across this habitation. Seeds of eucalyptus, adenanthera, coix and corymbia found in the area were colourful and tough, and they came in various sizes and shapes. “An idea sparked: if we designed jewellery and taught them how to make them, they could sell the products for a living.”\nA few prototypes of the jewellery designs were submitted to the TNSCST in August 2023 and the Council approved the project in January 2024. Then began the tough task of bringing the villagers together. “They were shy and would not entertain outsiders. So, we went through the tribal headman who helped us getting a few people,” Ms. Usha elaborated.\nThe training for the villagers began in January, and she filed the IPR applications through the IPR cell set up by the Council at the university in March. “The idea of setting up these cells is to protect our intellectual property and use them for the benefit of the people,” said S. Vincent, Member Secretary, TNSCST. The council has already set up 40 such cells.\nFifty villagers from Pethuparai Bharathi Annanagar and Pallangi-Kombai hamlets have been trained in jewellery-making, Ms. Usha said. As an aside, members of a women’s self help group from Vadakounji and Vadajaraparai were trained in apiculture (beekeeping), in collaboration with sisters from Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI).\nThe people living in these hamlets largely belonged to the Pazhiyar and Puliyar tribes and have been eking out a living, collecting lichens, soap nuts, gooseberry, honey and other non-timber forest produce and selling them to intermediaries for a pittance, Ms. Usha said. “The place is so remote that the nearest bus stop is 29 kilometres away. Very few have studied till high school,” she added."

Those elections should be declared null and void,” Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said during a press conference at the party headquarters.\nThe ECI should not start an exercise like the National Register of Citizens (NRC)in the name of revision of electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said. The SIR should not be about verifying citizenship, which is the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.\nThe SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar showed the poll panel had admitted to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party, had been saying — that there was a problem with the electoral rolls, Mr. Kumar said.\n“If Rahul Gandhi is right, then the ECI should give the Congress the data it has been asking for. First, they should accept this, and then adopt the right method to rectify it,” he said.\n“If they have to revise, it should be done with transparency and given proper time. What would be done in three months? It should be given 13 months or [carried out] over three years... They should revise electoral rolls and not ask for proof of citizenship. That is the job of the Union Home Ministry,” Mr. Kumar said.\nThe Congress leader also expressed grave concern over “the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar”, alleging that criminals had no fear of the law and were roaming around freely in the State.\nThe education system in Bihar had collapsed under the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, he alleged.\n“I want to tell the youth that if those in power are not bothered about your future, and are only worried about their chairs (a reference to positions of power), then they should be removed from their chairs,” Mr. Kumar said."

Bindu calling for discussions on marks  processes and development of tools for the same.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the KHSTU said decisions taken without any discussions on such grave issues as normalisation had led to change in candidates’ ranks, putting students under immense stress and resulting in setbacks in courts. This created wrong precedent and allowed mistakes to continue, the association alleged.\nThe government should organise discussions and deliberation instead of taking unilateral decisions so that apprehensions of State higher secondary students’ who were unfairly disadvantaged could be addressed."

After this period, the authority said it may cancel Aadhaar numbers issued to those who have not done the biometric update. A ₹100 fee applies if such an application is made after a child turns seven.\nAlso Read |IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw showcases new Aadhaar app for instant authentication\n“Aadhaar with updated biometric facilitates ease of living and ensures seamless usage of Aadhaar in availing services such as school admissions, registering for entrance examinations, availing benefits of scholarships, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, etc wherever applicable,” the UIDAI said. “Parents/ guardians are advised to update biometrics of their children/wards in Aadhaar, on priority,” it added.\nThe Aadhaar issuer said it has started sending SMS messages to the mobile numbers registered in the Aadhaar of such children for completing the MBU exercise. “The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age,” the UIDAI said."

Mr. Salam claimed that the sufferings of the patients here were many times more than what their counterparts in other government hospitals were facing.\n“There are no drugs. The government is yet to clear the dues worth crores of rupees to distributors of drugs and surgical devices. Some of those companies have stopped their supply,” he said. Poor patients were forced to wait for months for emergency surgeries. They were forced to depend on private hospitals, which would make crores of rupees in profit. “The government is deliberately trying to help private hospitals. The new block for surgical superspeciality and emergency care had to be temporarily closed after fire outbreaks. It is yet to be reopened,” he said."

He made the appeal during a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday, as part of his two-day visit to the national capital.\nMr. Naidu was accompanied by Union Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, Minister of State for Rural Development Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, TDP Lok Sabha floor leader Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu and others.\nThe Chief Minister explained that the project aims to divert 200 tmc ft of surplus floodwaters from the Polavaram reservoir to the Banakacherla regulator in Kurnool district. This, he said, would provide long-term irrigation and drinking water solutions to drought-prone Rayalaseema. Emphasising Andhra Pradesh’s rights as the tail-end State of the Godavari river system, Mr. Naidu said the State should fully utilise the surplus water available for 90 to 120 days each year. He sought the Centre’s assistance for the inter-basin transfer initiative.\nMr. Naidu also thanked the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing senior TDP leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju as Governor and acknowledged the Centre’s support during the State’s financial difficulties. He reiterated the need for additional financial aid to compensate for the fiscal losses incurred due to bifurcation and said a representation was made to the 16th Finance Commission in this regard.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu met NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat to discuss plans for developing aerospace and defence industries in Rayalaseema. Later, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Managing Director Vikas Kumar also called on the Chief Minister and held discussions on possible collaboration for metro rail projects in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada."

The system has been developed in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Centre for e-Governance (C-eG), the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), and the Karnataka State Nursing Examination Board.\nWith this technology, the Karnataka State Nursing Council can directly retrieve personal data, address, photo, and other details of nurses from the Aadhaar server through e-KYC. Previously, nursing candidates from various districts had to travel to the council’s central office in Bengaluru for registration.\nThe new DigiLocker-Requester technology enables the council to directly fetch Aadhaar cards, SSLC and PU marks cards, and other certificates from respective examination boards. Using technology adopted by RGUHS and the board, examination results will be directly accessed by the council. Subsequently, registration certificates will be issued directly to nurses through DigiLocker-Issuer.\nSharan Prakash Patil, Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, felicitated four participants from Karnataka who won medallions of excellence at the WorldSkills Competition held in Lyon, France, a few months ago.\nThe competition saw nine participants from Karnataka. Among them, Prem, Harshavardhan, Bhanu Prasad, and Darshan Gowda won medallions of excellence in three skills — additive manufacturing, cooking, and mechatronics categories. Earlier, 62 participants from Karnataka had competed in the national-level competition held in New Delhi. Karnataka participants won 13 gold, 12 silver, four bronze, and 19 Medals of Excellence at the event, securing the second position overall. They all were felicitated on Tuesday."

    "content": "Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) demanded thatthe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Biharbe withdrawn immediately and that the Assembly elections this year be conducted on the basis of the 2024 voter list.\nHe also raised concerns about certain claims of the Election Commission (EC), questioning how suddenly people from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were being found by EC sources.\n“This is a lie. Elections were held in 2024. Was there any such complaint regarding that voter list? Did any party make such a complaint? How and from where did it appear suddenly?“ he asked, addressing a press conference in Patna.\nHe further said, “In 2019, the Election Commission wrote to the Parliament that there were no foreign voters in 2016-2019. There were only 3 such complaints in 2018. In such a situation, where are foreigners [being] found in Bihar in 2025? Mushars will be found in every village of Bihar, will they be called people of Myanmar?”\nMr. Bhattacharya alleged that migrant labourers and Muslims of Bihar were being called Bangladeshi. He added that migrant workers from West Bengal were also facing the same problem because they spoke Bengali.\n“Now, how did the labourers who speak Hindi also become Bangladeshi? This is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is a relation of daughter and bread with Nepal. Every day, our every apprehension is being confirmed. This is a mockery of the Constitution,” Mr. Bhattacharya alleged.\nCriticising the ongoing SIR, he added that the campaign was being run by terrorising people. “Why is this atmosphere of terror being created?” he asked.\nHe also took a dig at the EC over its statement that there were problems with the SIR and they had a large number of Booth Level Officers (BLO) and volunteers.\n“One-third time has passed, and the reports coming out from the ground prove that BLOs have not reached many houses, and hardly anyone has received the two forms. Whatever is going on is a game of numbers, a terrible chaos,” he said.\nClaiming that the BLOs themselves were upset, Mr. Bhattacharya said that one officer had died under pressure, and many were saying they too did not have the required documents.\nGanesh Prasad Yadav, 51, a BLO in Kako Panchayat in Madhubani district, had died following a heart attack last Friday.\n“One Block Development Officer (BDO) in Katihar resigned, alleging harassment. If a BLO says anything, action is taken against them,” he said, adding that an FIR was filed against senior journalist Anjit Anjum “just for showing the truth”.\nMr. Bhattacharya also questioned the authority given to Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take a call when voters were unable to provide the required documents. In such cases, the EROs can decide based on local investigation or other documentary evidence.\n“There is a complete attempt to steal this election. That is why people of Bihar have started raising the slogan —chunav chor gaddi chhod(election thieves should leave the throne),” he said.\nHe went on to say, “The right to vote of every voter should be guaranteed. The Election Commission has also sent a letter to us. We want to meet separately. SIR has to be withdrawn. The 2025 elections should be conducted properly on the basis of the 2024 voter list. There should be peaceful elections in Bihar.”"

The belief that these cases are occurring only in Hassan is incorrect.”\nInstead of panicking, people should focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, getting adequate sleep, and exercising regularly. “Only those having symptoms of heart-related illness should go for a medical check-up. Do not rush to hospitals without a reason,” Dr. Patil said.\nThe Minister further noted that lifestyle changes after COVID-19 have led to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. “Dietary habits have changed, and stress levels have increased. We are studying the reasons behind the rise in deaths among the youth,” he said."

    "content": "A day after the government revised autorickshaw fares in Bengaluru, auto unions termed the hike “unscientific” and demanded to raise the base fare to ₹40.\nThe new fare structure raises the base fare from ₹30 to ₹36 for the first 2 km. Beyond that, the per-km rate increases from ₹15 to ₹18. The fare revision, announced by the Bengaluru Urban district administration on July 14, is set to take effect from August 1.\nThe revision comes after a gap of five years, but autorickshaw drivers are far from happy. The Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) has strongly opposed the move, calling it “unilateral, unscientific, and against due process.”\nSpeaking toThe Hindu,T.M. Rudramurthy, general secretary of ARDU, said, “We have been requesting for fare revision since 2023. The previous Deputy Commissioners had at least held consultations with unions. But the present Deputy Commissioner, G. Jagadeesha, has taken this decision without holding any meeting. We strongly condemn this one-sided move.”\nThe union has written a letter to Mr. Jagadeesha, pointing out what it claims are procedural lapses. “As per Rule 53 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, the Deputy Commissioner is not the chairperson of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). Despite this, he has issued the order unilaterally. This is not acceptable,” the letter stated.\nThe union is demanding a base fare of ₹40 for the first 2 km and ₹20 for every additional km. It has also called for annual fare revisions, arguing that long gaps between revisions are unfair given the rising cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance.\n“A revision every five years is not enough. The cost of living rises every year, and autorickshaw drivers cannot survive without annual fare adjustments,” Mr. Rudramurthy added.\nMeanwhile, the fare hike has also drawn flak from commuters, who are already feeling the pinch of rising transportation costs. “The government has already increased bus and metro fares. Now, with auto fares also going up, it’s becoming unaffordable for daily commuters,” said R. Divya, a private company employee in Koramangala.\nAnother commuter, Anil Kumar, who travels regularly between Jayanagar and Infantry road, said, “Auto fares on aggregator apps are already higher than the government-fixed rates. Now this hike just feels like a formality. We are not seeing any real benefit as passengers.”\nTraffic and urban mobility experts believe the issue lies not in the fare hike itself but in the lack of regular revisions.\nTransport expert M.N. Sreehari said, “Regular fare revisions could help reduce the widespread issue of auto drivers refusing rides in Bengaluru. Many commuters complain about drivers not using the meter. Annual revisions would likely decrease overcharging and improve compliance.”\nHe added that sudden and long-delayed hikes often lead to discontent on all sides, including drivers, commuters, and even aggregators.\nAggregator platforms, including apps like Ola, Namma Yatri, Rapido, and Uber, are expected to update their fare structures in line with the government’s revision.\nA representative of a leading auto aggregator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We will increase our base fare and per-km charges from August 1, as per the new government directive.”\nSome auto aggregators have already started displaying the revised minimum fare of ₹36. A leading aggregator has adopted the new fare even before its official implementation on August 1."

Yet, Mr. Vikramarka had made ‘false statements’ which are ‘defamatory in nature’ with a ‘preconceived motive to tarnish the fame and reputation’ of the BJP leader, said the notice.\nCondemning the Deputy CM’s statements, the notice said it has caused ‘irreversible’ damage to the Telangana BJP president’s reputation.

Therefore, we are discussing holding elections to student unions in colleges and universities.”\nBut university authorities are worried. “The campuses are witnessing academic activities now and the universities are at peace. If the elections are reintroduced, then they will turn into political parties’ votebank platforms and may witness violence and groupism within the universities,” said the Vice Chancellor of a state run university."

A look at such symbols with the size in which they are displayed on ballot papers/EVM machines clearly show the similarities of the free symbols with the BRS symbol of car.\nIt could be clearly understood as to how candidates getting those symbols had been cutting into BRS votes in the past, affecting the prospects of BRS candidates.

To evade detection, she travelled with a child to avoid suspicion. In a swift follow-up action, another African national, who had arranged the contraband, was also apprehended, the official release said.\nIn the second operation, 2 kg of methamphetamine were seized. The contraband was sourced from Delhi, packed at a location in West Delhi, and concealed in the luggage of an African national who transported it to Bengaluru via a domestic flight. Investigations revealed that the individual had entered India on a student or tourist visa but failed to return upon its expiry. Instead, she assumed a new identity by procuring a forged passport under a different nationality to evade detection and tracking by enforcement agencies. Further, investigation in both the cases is under way.\nTo fight against drug trafficking, NCB seeks the support of the citizens. Any person can share information related to the sale of narcotics by calling on MANAS- National Narcotics Helpline Toll Free Number-1933.

Addiction to reels will only waste your time and distract you.”\nThe AIMIM president emphasised that India’s Muslim minorities must become politically and professionally empowered.

We will overcome them if we are united and strong: politically, and in fields like science, engineering, medicine and law,” Mr. Owaisi said.\nUnderscoring the acute need for more lawyers within the community, he said, “The Muslim minorities need more and more lawyers who will raise their voices for their sharia, personal laws, fundamental rights and against police injustice.”\nHe also expressed concern over alarming dropout rates among Muslim students, noting that over 21 lakh children had dropped out, of whom 51 % were girls. He warned that such educational exclusion, which was primarily due to fee non-affordability by weaker sections. This, he said, was not only a loss for the minority community, but for the nation as a whole. He criticised the narrowing of pre-matric scholarships by the Union government.\nMr. Owaisi said the Prime Minister’s vision of a“Viksit Bharat”would remain unfulfilled unless minorities received equitable educational opportunities. “If you go to Muslim areas, you will find more liquor shops and police stations. What is required are schools and hospitals, only then will the country become stronger,” he opined."

    "content": "The police have arrested four people, including three habitual offenders from Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly making a ransom call to a city businessman posing as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi last week.\nThe suspects have been identified as Rafiq, a Bengaluru businessman, and Amith, Vansh Sachdev, and Sheeshpal Singh, alias Monty, all from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.\nOn July 8, one of the suspects from U.P. called a Bengaluru businessman claiming to be Bishnoi, and threatened to kidnap his son and demanded ₹1 crore. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster linked to several high-profile murders, including that of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.\nAfter the businessman filed a complaint, the police formed two teams and traced the complainant’s call records. The police were able to trace a car used by the suspects while in Bengaluru. Further investigation revealed that three of the suspects were from U.P. and had taken shelter in Delhi after making the call.\nAn investigator in the case said they contacted the Delhi police and, with their help, apprehended the suspects. They were brought to Bengaluru, while another team in the city arrested Rafiq.\nThe police said that Rafiq and the complainant knew each other. Rafiq and the complainant were involved in a land sale deal, and Rafiq strongly believed that the complainant had earned more. This led to resentment, and Rafiq sought to recover the money, prompting him to approach his friends from U.P., said the police.\n“Rafiq told the others that the victim was naive and would pay them if they merely threatened him. He promised to share a portion of the extorted money if they helped him,” an officer toldThe Hindu.\nRafiq also covered all the expenses of his associates, who arranged guns and ammunition to carry out the plan.\nThe officer explained that the plan was to first make a call and demand a ransom. If that failed, they intended to proceed with the kidnapping and planned to release the victim once the ransom was paid.\nHakay Akshay Machhindra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division), toldThe Hindu: “The prime suspect from Bengaluru (Rafiq), had an ongoing cheating case in Delhi, where he befriended the other suspects during court proceedings”.\nAccording to the police, the entire operation was executed in just 48 hours. All suspects are currently in police custody, as investigators are yet to recover the weapons arranged for the plan."

    "content": "As the deadline set by the Kerala High Court for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to justify continued toll collection on the Edappally–Mannuthy National Highway expired on Tuesday, the grim reality on the ground remains unchanged.\nThe Division Bench had on July 9 ordered the NHAI to submit an affidavit within a week explaining why toll collection should not be suspended due to poor road conditions. The court had also indicated that failure to comply with could lead to a temporary halt in toll operations.\nDespite the clear judicial warning, there has been no visible attempt to improve the road conditions. Commuters continue to endure appalling travel experiences, with underpass construction on in several stretches — Chirangara, Mudikkode, Kallidukku, Vaniyampara, and Perambra —  forcing vehicles to divert through service roads. These alternative routes are neither reinforced nor properly tarred, leading to massive potholes, stagnant water, and slushy, unmotorable surfaces.\nThousands of vehicles on the under-construction stretches such as Muringoor and Chirangara have been diverted trough the dangerously downgraded service roads without adequate safety infrastructure. At many places, only plastic traffic cones and loosely tied ropes serve as makeshift barricades. Inadequate signage and poor lighting make these areas even more perilous.\nRecently, a car carrying passengers plunged into a water-filled pothole on the national highway, underscoring the dangers posed by poorly marked, depressed zones along the road. While concrete blocks have been installed in a few locations, vast sections are still secured with only minimal and temporary measures.\nAreas such as Koratty, Chirangara and Muringoor are reported to be in particularly pathetic condition. Even the main highway is riddled with potholes. At Perambra, road work resumed recently after being stalled by rain, but the workforce remains inadequate.\nOn the Thrissur–Chalakudy route, service roads are periodically dug up for repairs, causing further congestion. Meanwhile, only one side of the Chalakudy–Thrissur highway has protective sidewalls, raising serious concerns over commuter safety.\nDespite previous patch-ups, potholes have resurfaced across the service roads, causing traffic to slow down and often grind to a halt. Roadrolling machines and stone-metalling have failed to produce durable results. A journey from Thrissur to Ernakulam now frequently takes up an additional  two hours — a bitter irony for those paying toll for what they describe as “travel through misery.”\nThe construction of three underpasses on the Mannuthy–Vadakkenchery  section— at Vaniyampara, Mudikkode, and Kallidukku — is also moving at a snail’s pace. Locals claim that work is only actively happening at Vaniyampara.\nAt Mudikkode and Kallidukku, only three workers are reportedly deployed at each site. Although the projects are scheduled for completion by October, locals fear the deadline will be missed unless work resumes at full scale."

    "content": "With local body polls hardly a few months away, opposing fronts at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have sharpened their attacks on rivals. This was evident in recent meetings of the Corporation council which have witnessed a flurry of corruption allegations, protests and scuffles, sometimes requiring the intervention of police personnel.\nAfter the prolonged protests over revenue collection issues in 2021, the current term was fairly peaceful, with disruption of council meetings being rare events. However, this seems to have changed over the past few weeks.\nIn a council meeting on June 26, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) put the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive by levelling corruption allegations against two of its councillors. Punnakkamugal councillor P.V. Manju was accused of aiding a coverup in the alleged misappropriation of around ₹3 lakh collected by the local Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) unit as user fee from households in the ward. The issue came to light when some of the members of the unit raised a complaint with the junior health inspector that their monthly wages, which is dependent on the user fee, was delayed.\nPappanamcode councillor G.S. Asha Nath was accused of collecting money from beneficiaries for providing the Corporation’s application for various schemes. The BJP defended both the councillors vehemently. At the next council meeting on Monday, the two councillors were at the forefront of violent protests when the BJP levelled corruption allegations against the LDF, which was accused of favouritism in the inclusion of an LDF councillor’s name in the list for appointment of sanitation workers. The LDF maintained that the list was prepared in a transparent manner through the Employment Exchange.\nEven as the two fronts appear to be planning to go ahead with more protests over the allegations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has not really made its presence felt, reflective of its diminished numbers in the council.\nIn 2020 local body elections, the LDF had weathered a stiff challenge from the BJP to improve its numbers in the 100-ward council to 51 from 43 in 2015. It also got the support of three independent councillors and also managed to win the three byelections which were held in the current term. The BJP, which had made major gains in 2015, improving its tally from six seats to 35, remained almost static at 34 seats.\nWith the redrawing of the ward contours and the increase of one more ward after the recent delimitation, the three fronts are expected to go all out to retain their strongholds and wrest control of wards which they lost last time around."

Since March 1, more than ₹1.17 crore has been levied by way of penalties for violations such as littering of the roads, and dumping of construction debris in public spaces and water bodies. Realisation of penalties, however, is just a third of the total, at ₹39.85 lakh all put together.\nThe CCMS app has been installed in the mobile phones of Sanitation, Solid Waste Management and the Town Planning officials who are tasked with identifying the violations in their respective purviews and uploading the same on to the app.\nThe aim of the app is to make the process transparent, and limit manual intervention, said officials from the Sanitation wing. Hence, it is mandatory for the field staff to upload pictures of the respective violations with GPS coordinates, just like in case of traffic challans.\nChallans are issued online and payments are received online too. The violators are intimated about the challans through SMSes.\nThe Assistant Medical Officers of Health and the Assistant City Planners of each circle have been authorised to generate challans.\nThe Sanitation wing has detected a total 3,944 instances of violation so far, amounting to over ₹69 lakh in penalties. Of these, 2,535 challans were realised, earning the corporation a revenue of nearly ₹26 lakh. A total 1,409 challans are pending as on July 12, and their realisation would yield over ₹43 lakh.\nMaximum number of challans, at 955, were generated in Kukatpally circle, amounting to a total penal amount of approximately ₹6.21 lakh, with Uppal as second lead with 492 challans - amounting to ₹6.57 lakh. Highest in terms of the amount of penalty, however, is Moosapet circle, with ₹10.38 lakh levied by way of mere 206 challans. Next in line is Chandanagar, with over ₹7 lakh levied through 76 challans.\nThe Town Planning wing, through ACPs, issued 537 challans, that would gross ₹48 lakh in penalties. Of these, 221 challans were realised to the tune of ₹13.95 lakh. Begumpet circle charged the highest at ₹9.75 lakh in 36 instances of C&D dumping, while Secunderabad led in terms of the number of challans at 62."

The trailer has also been impounded.\nThe detainees were identified as Saddam, 35, and Zaitool, 32, from Haryana, and Najir Ahammad, 30, from Rajasthan. Shortly after being brought to the Panangad police station, Najir reportedly pretended to go to the bathroom, locked himself inside, and escaped by breaking the toilet window. However, he was chased down and caught.\nThe State Police Control Room had issued an alert around midnight on Monday (July 14), stating that a Rajasthan-registered trailer suspected of involvement in the Krishnagiri car theft had crossed the border into Kerala.\n“We found the Rajasthan-registered trailer parked near the Nettoor mosque around 3.30 a.m. under suspicious circumstances, with three persons inside. The vehicle was transporting 52 air conditioners from a company in Haryana to a godown at Nettoor, and all documents were in order. However, gas cutters and other suspicious tools were found inside the trailer, and none of the three could give a satisfactory explanation. Following this, they were detained and brought to the station,” said sources in the Panangad police.\nDuring interrogation, the suspects reportedly confessed to stealing a car by loading it onto the trailer. “They had hidden the stolen vehicle under shrubbery and wild growth in Krishnagiri, intending to retrieve it on their return journey to Haryana after delivering the air conditioners. The Tamil Nadu police have since recovered the car based on our information,” said police sources.\nThe police also suspect the trio may be involved in ATM thefts, given the presence of a gas cutter in the trailer. It was found that both Zaitool and Najir have theft cases registered against them in Haryana. “We are collecting details of the case and also verifying whether Saddam has any criminal background as well,” the sources said."

    "content": "After a brief hiatus, the southwest monsoon conditions have strengthened across the State with the intensification of monsoon flow of wind from the Arabian Sea. North and central Kerala will have some intense spells of rain compared to the rest of State for the next week, with spillover rain even benefitting parts of south Kerala.\nThe peak monsoon feature offshore trough, which was in a feeble condition, has now turned into active mode with the trough extending from the Gujarat coast to the south Kerala coast on Tuesday. The strengthening westerlies are expected to dump moisture from the Arabian Sea into the trough and flow into the landmass of Kerala, triggering some intense spells.\nFurther, the monsoon trough is at present connecting two weather systems — a depression that is centred over central parts of north Rajasthan and another depression over Southeast Gangetic West Bengal, which now moved over Jharkhand on Tuesday — fortifying each other to sustain the rainfall activity, said V.K. Mini, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe current spell is likely to bridge the shortfall of July rain over the State, with the north half of Kerala having the lion’s share of rain, including parts of central Kerala. However, the rest of the region, particularly southern districts like Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, may not have any intense spells, although patchy and short-duration spells are likely.\nThe places to watch out for heavy rain include parts of Wayanad and Idukki, where normal rainfall has been prevailing during the last two weeks, although the monsoon was relatively weak over the State in the first half of July compared to June rainfall. Excess or normal precipitation in Ghat regions will have a cumulative impact, as the soil in the regions is already soaked in rainwater. Although the IMD has not issued any red alert, a situation resembling a red alert is likely in parts of central and north Kerala during the weekend, said Ms. Mini.\nKudulu in Kasaragod district recorded the highest rainfall of 13 cm during the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by Muliyar and Bayar in Kasaragod with 11 cm each. An orange alert has been issued warning of heavy to very heavy rain for five districts — Idukki, Ernakulam, Thirssur, Kannur and Kasaragod — on Wednesday, and a yellow alert for the rest of the State forecasting isolated heavy rain."

Ramchander Rao for his remarks on the inclusion of Muslims in the Backward Classes (BC) category in the State. He claimed that poor Muslims were first included in the BC category during the British period, adding that Muslims were part of the BCs even in BJP-ruled states.\nSpeaking to the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Tuesday, the Congress MP advised Mr. Ramchander Rao to gain subject knowledge before making such comments. “Ramchander Rao lacks substance, that’s why he is resorting to babbling. It would be better if he gained knowledge on the subject before commenting,” he said.\nMr. Kiran Kumar also alleged that the BJP was attempting to divide people along religious and caste lines. “I hope that at least Ramchander Rao should not do the same thing,” he said, appealing to the BJP for cooperation in the State’s development. He reiterated the Congress government’s commitment to implementing 42% reservations for BCs."

Following this, individuals associated with the debt allegedly entered his room and seized his friend’s laptop and mobile phone. On July 13, at around 2 p.m., Ramakanth again contacted his father asking for money. The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., he made another call, stating that he was being harassed for repayment. Later that day, he took the drastic step.\nRamakanth was shifted to a private hospital in Bahadurpally, where he was declared dead.

Anil Kumar from using his official vehicle on Tuesday.\nDr. Kunnummal has issued instructions to Director (Planning and Development) Mini Dejo Kappen, who has been given additional charge of Registrar, and the security wing to implement the order. However, while similar orders had been issued earlier, the outcome of the latest order remains to be seen.\nThe Students’ Federation of India (SFI) renewed its protest against the Vice-Chancellor, a day after he accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-feeder of preventing his entry into the campus.\nScores of SFI activists marched to the university headquarters amid police vigil, chanting slogans against Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and the Vice-Chancellor. SFI State secretary P.S. Sanjeev, who launched the demonstration, accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of systematically infiltrating the State’s universities through temporary Vice-Chancellor appointments. He also blamed Dr. Kunnummal for the administrative impasse that prevailed at the university.\nAmid the persisting stand-off, the university remains caught in the worrying administrative stalemate with several crucial files, including degree and equivalency certificate applications and Plan fund release requests, pending clearance. Those required to conduct PhD theses presentations and facilitate career advancements have also been stalled.\nThe scenario has also paved the way for concerns about the potential lapse of a significant funding of ₹100 crore the university stood to receive under the Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (PM-USHA). Calicut and Kannur Universities were chosen for similar allocations under the national scheme, which guaranteed a total funding of ₹405 crore for educational institutions in Kerala.\nThe State government had submitted proposals and presentations to secure the funding, which is supposed to be shared on a 60:40 basis between the Central and State governments. The guidelines mandated that the entire amount be utilised before March 31 for universities to remain eligible for direct funding in the future.\nThe universities had constituted committees and commenced preliminary steps to implement the finalised projects to meet the criterion. However, the absence of Vice-Chancellor from office and the inability to convene Syndicate committees threatened to jeopardise the universities’ prospects for expansion."

The project was proposed on a 50:50 cost share basis between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The State of Telangana has already released its full share and completed and commissioned the 56-kilometer-long railway line from Bhadrachalam to Sathupalli. Work in Andhra Pradesh is stalled.\nAt a meeting in Hyderabad on July 15, SCR general manager Sanjay Kumar Srivastava told Rajamahendravaram MP D. Purandeswari,  “We are waiting for the release of the cost share by the Andhra Pradesh State government to proceed with the Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line project. The Telangana State had already released its due share”. The project is targeted to be completed and commissioned by April 2030.\nResponding to an appeal by Ms. Purandeswari to speed up the ₹271 crore modernisation of the Rajahmundry railway station ahead of the Godavari Pushkarams-2027, Mr. Sanjay Kumar assured that tenders would be invited within a week. Ms. Purandeswari alleged that the tenders had not been invited, despite funds being released six months ago.\nShe also raised the issue of reduced train halts at the Kovvur railway station. She said: “As many as 18 trains, including those destined to Chennai and Tirupati via Kovvur, used to halt at Kovvur railway station. However, post-covid, only eight trains halt there. The major trains which no longer make stops at Kovvur include the Tirumala, Seshadri and Sarkar Express trains.” She urged the SCR to reconsider train halts at Kovvur.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar was further urged to resume local train operations from Rajahmundry to Bhimavaram, Tanuku and Narsapuram which were suspended during COVID-19.\nIn regards to the electrification of the Nidadavole railway line, Ms. Purandeswari said that ₹6 crore is still required to connect the line to the main power supply to complete the ₹150 crore line electrification project."

Revanth Reddy take total responsibility for the food poisoning and student deaths in these institutions. Neither the State government nor Mr. Revanth Reddy who handles the Education portfolio had conducted even one review meeting despite the heartbreaking incidents. The BRS leader termed it as a glaring example of inhuman rule.\nIn a statement, he said: “If such incidents happen once or twice, they may be considered accidental, but when over a thousand incidents occur and children are falling like birds, the government is still in deep slumber”. He urged Mr. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday to at least think like a father, if not as the Chief Minister.\nSpeaking as a father of two, Mr. Rama Rao asked Mr. Revanth Reddy to take the issue seriously. He recalled that the Chief Minister had once asked: “Who should be held responsible for student deaths, who should be hanged?”. He pointed out that BRS had repeatedly brought the issue of food poisoning and student deaths to the government’s notice, but in vain."

    "content": "With groundwater rendered saline, several fishing villages in Tharangambadi taluk of Mayiladuthurai district continue to face irregular and inadequate drinking water supply, severely disrupting daily life.\nVillages such as Chinoorpettai, Chandrapadi, Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, Pudupettai, Chinnangudi, and Chinnamedu get water supply only once in 10 days — or at times, even longer gaps — leaving residents with limited access to safe drinking water.\n“We receive water only once in 10 days. The groundwater is completely saline so we rely entirely on TWAD-supplied water from Kollidam,” said Rajeswari S., a fisherwoman from Chinoorpettai. “Private water sellers charge ₹7.50 per can, and prices rise to ₹10 in summer. We are forced to cook with saline water, which is unsafe.”\nChandrapadi, the tail-end panchayat of Mayiladuthurai, comprising Chandrapadi and Chinoorpettai, is especially dependent on piped supply. Despite this, residents say distribution remains erratic.\nIn Manikkapangu panchayat, which covers Kuttyandiyur, Vellakoil, Perumal Pettai, and Pudupettai, villagers say water is rationed on a rotation basis — typically to only one village per day — resulting in supply once a week or less.\n“The Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines were installed, damaging existing roads. But no water comes through them — it’s just for show,” said Mathavi C. of Kuttyandiyur. “When we ask for more supply, panchayat officials say they receive only limited quantities.”\nG. Veeramani and M. Rathinavel from Perumalpettai added that even when water is delivered, its quality is poor and it tastes unpleasant.\nSimilar complaints were reported from Chinnangudi in Maruthampallam panchayat and Chinnamedu in Kalamanallur panchayat, where residents echoed concerns about erratic and inadequate supply.\nWhen contacted, officials from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) in Mayiladuthurai acknowledged the issue and said efforts were under way to improve the situation.\n“Water is drawn from infiltration wells at Papakudi in Kollidam, collected in a sump, and distributed via two lines — one to Sirkazhi and the other to Tharangambadi,” an official said. “While source scarcity is real, there is also a tendency to overstate the problem,” he said.\nThe official added that a ₹2,200-crore proposal under the Jal Jeevan Mission is awaiting government approval. “We are ready to proceed once the necessary G.O. is issued,” the official said."

Ashok Reddy said on Tuesday. The unusual situation arose particularly for lack of abundant rain this month.\nIt was 86,520 water tankers from July 1 to 14, compared to 63,724 water tankers during the same period last year. The Board has a fleet of 1,135 water tankers and 140 filling points.\nAs during any dry period, the demand for water tankers even in July is from six divisions in the city – SR Nagar, Kukatpally, Durgam Cheruvu, Nizampet, Manikonda, and Sahebnagar.\nRWHs mandatory\nOfficials noted that about 42,000 consumers, of the total 14 lakh connections, are water tanker buyers. A majority of 2.84 lakh tankers or 90% of the tankers were also booked by these repeat consumers during the summer season.\nOfficials said a rainwater harvesting (RWH) pit was mandatory for every house with an area of 300 sq. yards and above. A related survey conducted last year revealed that about 16,000 consumers, who are only dependent on tankers for their daily water, are also the ones without an RWH.\nThe Board also proposed the doubling of water tanker charges last year but did not implement it. However, a list of such consumers would be prepared shortly, for compulsory awareness and for constructing RWHs."

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave the Kerala government 24 hours to inform if it intends to appeal a High Court direction to publish the revised rank list of the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical Examination (KEAM) 2025.\nA Bench headed by Justice P.S. Narasimha made it clear that the court’s interference would be minimal and based on legal principles and not on facts.\n“We are very clear... We are not going to interfere in any existing selection, appointment processes. The country is plagued with this problem of uncertainty as every exam, every appointment comes under challenge and gets delayed. We will consider this case on principles, but so far as facts are concerned, we will not interfere,” Justice Narasimha addressed the parties in the court room.\nScheduling the case for hearing for July 16, the court instructed Kerala State counsel C.K. Sasi to take instructions from the government and apprise the Bench.\nThe original prospectus for KEAM 2025, which was held between April 22-30, had prescribed that the marks obtained in 10+2 in respect of Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be in the ratio of 1:1:1.\nHowever, the Kerala government had constituted a Standardisation Review Committee on April 9 to study the method and formula used to calculate standardised/normalised marks of KEAM-2025 and to suggest any changes. The committee had submitted its report on June 2.\nFollowing which, the State, taking into consideration the committee report and the suggestions given by the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations, decided to amend the ratio for subject marks in KEAM 2025.\nOn July 1, the State ordered that the marks obtained in 10+2 for Maths, Physics and Chemistry would be taken in the ratio of 5:3:2 instead of the earlier 1:1:1. The existing 50:50 ratio for marks obtained in the entrance examination and 10+2 Board examination would continue. The State published the KEAM rank list the same day.\nOn July 10, the High Court directed the reversion to 1:1:1 as provided in the original prospectus. The High Court had reasoned that the modification to the standardisation formula was made belatedly, after the conclusion of the entrance examination and merely an hour prior to the publication of the rank list. The High Court had found the timing both arbitrary and unsustainable in law. The revised rank list was published on July 11.\nAppearing for the State syllabus students on Tuesday, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Zulfiker Ali P.S., argued that the State was empowered to make the amendments to original prospectus to create a “level playing field for candidates of the State Board and the CBSE”.\n“The old standardisation formula [prior to the amendment to the original prospectus] was disproportionate and disadvantageous to the majority of students studying under the State syllabus in government schools. It is important to note that in Kerala government school students predominately come from middle and lower-income backgrounds,” Mr. Bhushan contended.\nJustice Narasimha remarked the “new rule balances much better than the earlier one” but questioned the timing of the modification to the standardisation formula in July, months after the KEAM exam and just before the declaration of the results.\n“The issue is we do not doubt the new rule, but when you introduce a new policy... can you do it all of a sudden? Do you not have to declare it first and say it will be implemented from next year…” Justice Narasimha asked advocate Bhushan.\nSenior advocate Raju Ramachandran and advocate Aljo Joseph, on a caveat for CBSE students, highlighted that the formula was revised an hour before the publication of the rank list on July 1.\nMr. Bhushan said the problem of disparity between the State syllabus students and their CBSE counterparts had been flagged by the Controller of Examinations in 2024 itself. He said the High Court order had affected a large number of students in Kerala while seeking urgent relief."

However, he was informed only a couple of days before the event. By then, his visit to Indi in Vijayapura was already scheduled.\n“The BJP leaders thought that the Chief Minister would speak about the tax collection and the dues from the Centre. To avoid embarrassment, they did not invite him in advance. MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi planned and executed the programme,” he remarked.\nHe maintained that the State government had been taking up many development works for the State, including the Sharavati Pumped Storage project. “It intends to generate 2,000 MW of power. The Central government has also given its consent for the project, which is being executed at a cost of ₹8,644 crore,” he said.\nRegarding the opposition to the project, Mr. Krishna said that the opposition from environmentalists was expected. However, the project would not disturb the local habitats to a large extent. A few families, which would be affected, had been convinced. The government would consider their demands, including jobs, with the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, he added."

    "content": "The rulingNational Conference (NC)on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) upped the ante against Jammu and Kashmir Governor Manoj Sinha, with Chief MinisterOmar Abdullahsaying he “suffered silently for the past eight months”.\n“We suffered in silence for the past eight months but did not complain. It’s for what happened yesterday that you (people) came to know about our reality. But don’t misconstrue our decency for weakness. We don’t talk loudly, threaten or resort togundagardi(hooliganism) but that does not mean we are weak. My strength is my people. I will always safeguard my strength,” Mr. Abdullah, who was addressing a function at the Jhelum Valley Medical College in Srinagar, said.\nMr. Abdullah was referring to the L-G administration’s security measures to stop the Chief Minister and the Ministers from visiting the graveyard where 22 civilians, killed during the 1931 uprising against the Dogra ruler, are buried. On July 14, there were dramatic images where Mr. Abdullah was seen climbing a wall to reach the graveyard and a police officer pushing him in a bid to stop him from paying tributes.\n“They (administration) tried their best to raise barricades on July 14. No barricade will push us away from our goal. We will work towards realising the dignity and dreams of people of Kashmir. There will be no sell out with the dreams of our people. It’s no favour we are ruling Jammu and Kashmir. It’s because of Allah and our people we are here today,” Mr. Abdullah said.\nIt’s for the first time since Mr. Abdullah won elections in October 2024 after a prolonged Central rule that he upped the ante to this high pitch against L-G Mr. Sinha, who retains the powers to transfer employees, both State and Central services, and spearhead the security forces in the union territory.\nThe dramatic images of Mr. Abdullah being heckled and disallowed to reach the graveyard in Srinagar evoked sharp reactions from national leaders, includingTamil NaduChief Minister M.K. Stalin,West BengalChief Minister Mamata Banerjee,Samajwadi Partypresident Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav.\n“At a time when there is a growing demand for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood, the current events unfolding there are a grim reminder of how far things have deteriorated. If this can happen in Kashmir, it can happen anywhere, to any elected representative of the people. Every democratic voice must unequivocally condemn this,” Mr. Stalin said in a post on X.\nMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) described the actions against the sitting Chief Minister as “an insult to democracy”.\n“This land saw countless sacrifices for freedom and the Constitution. Under the same Constitution, Mr. Abdullah’s government was elected by the people. Any insult to Mr. Abdullah is an insult to democracy, an insult to India’s democracy, and an insult to the people who gave us their mandate,” said Mr. Choudhary.\nMr. Choudhary said any insult or humiliation of our leader would not be tolerated. “We will not stay silent. What happened yesterday whether people speak up about it or not is an insult to every Indian who cast their vote,” he added.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister said one day the L-G, like taking responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack, might even say that what happened with OmarSahibwas wrong. “The police are under his control and acted unjustly. He (L-G) owes an apology for what happened yesterday,” he added.\nReferring to Mr. Sinha’s recent statement accepting responsibility for the security lapse in the Pahalgam terror attack, Mr. Abdullah said, “Someone has to be held responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack and now that the security lapses have been accepted.”"

    "content": "A sense of fear gripped Shalivahana Nagar, a residential colony in Malakpet here after gunfire shattered the early morning calm on Tuesday. The incident was reported around 7:20 a.m., just outside Shalivahana Nagar Park, where Communist Party of India (CPI) State Council member Chandu Naik, 47, was shot dead during morning walk.\nThe park, located at the end of a wide lane flanked by swanky independent houses and residential complexes, akiranastore, an Urban Primary Health Centre and many trees, turned into a scene of panic as the attackers allegedly fired five rounds at Naik from close range before fleeing in a car.\nOutside the park’s ‘West Gate’, police from the South East Zone cordoned off an area roughly the size of a human body, with a white chalk outlining the boundaries of the body. At its centre lay a large bloodstain.\nVijay Kumar (name changed on request), a local resident whose house faces the park, said: “I heard what sounded like firecrackers. I rushed out immediately and saw four men escaping in a white car after shooting Naik multiple times. They stood over him briefly to confirm he was dead, then drove away via the four-way junction to the left of the park.”\nThe road in front of the park, to Kumar’s residence, is wide enough for three SUVs to pass at a time. It was the same stretch the assailants used to speed away in their getaway vehicle, a hatchback, that they had rented from a nearby place.\nChandu Naik.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Arrangement\nKumar’s two children, aged 12 and 13, were coming downstairs to leave for school when the shots rang out. “They were terrified and ran back inside. It took some time to calm them down. I eventually had to escort them to their school van myself,” he added.\nHe also pointed out that Naik’s body remained at the spot for over half an hour before the police arrived. Despite the Urban Primary Health Centre being just a few steps away, the body was not moved.\nAnother resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “At first, we thought it was just kids shooting videos in the park again. But the gunshots continued. Minutes later, we saw a body in a pool of blood.” Like many others in the locality, he expressed concern for his safety and said he no longer felt secure taking his morning walk.\nAnil (name changed), who owns a kirana store about 100 metres from the site, said he opened his shop shortly after the attack. “People kept coming in, asking what the sounds were and what had happened. The whole area was in a state of shock,” he said.\nPolice officers at the crime scene.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                NAGARA GOPAL\nBy mid-morning, the lane was swarming with police patrol vehicles, and officers clad in khaki moved briskly across the colony, speaking to residents and scouring the area for clues. The park, which bustles with activity until 10 a.m., was deserted. Access was blocked as police launched an investigation into the shooting.\nMalakpet ACP K.Subba Rami Reddy stated that Naik had been accompanied to the park by his wife and daughter, who had left shortly before the attack. “Around 7.20 a.m., as Naik was walking back towards his car, four men got out of another vehicle and attacked him. One threw chilli powder into his eyes while the others shot him from point-blank range using a country-made pistol,” Mr.Reddy said."

Some ₹3.08 crore was sanctioned to the Karnataka Gramin Bank to develop connectivity infrastructure in underserved areas.\nNABARD released a booklet titled ‘Success Stories of FPOs in Karnataka’, which documented the inspiring journeys of farmer-producer organisations across the State. The booklet showcases how small and marginal farmers have successfully come together to access markets, add value to their produce, embrace digital platforms, and establish inclusive and resilient business models.\nNABARD has played a key role in supporting sustainable agriculture, developing secondary agriculture, creating value addition and in the development of rural infrastructure in Karnataka, acknowledged Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, she urged farmers in the State to make full use of NABARD’s schemes and become entrepreneurs.\nElaborating on value addition, the Chief Secretary said, instead of selling mangoes as raw produce, farmers should process them into various products and sell them. Recently, the price of Totapuri mango variety crashed, and if mango farmers set up small processing units in their villages, they would be able to earn income round the year, she said."

    "content": "Opposition leaders in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday came out in support of a teacher from Bareilly, who was booked under Section 353 (2) (making statements containing false information, rumour or alarming news) of the BNS for his poem, parts of which referred to the Kanwar Yatra.\nThe FIR against Rajneesh Gangwar, a teacher at Bareilly’s MGM Inter College, was registered on July 13, based on a complaint by an outfit named Kanwar Seva Samiti.\nThe video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, which recently went viral on social media, contains a portion where he says, “Kanwar leke mat jana, tum gyan ka deep jalana, manavta ke seva karke tum sachche manav ban jaana[Don’t get pots of holy water from the Ganga, light the lamp of knowledge, become a true human by serving humanity].”\nSharing the video of Mr. Gangwar reciting the poem, former U.P. Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X in Hindi, “The greatest religion is that which leads us on the path of humanity.”\nAttacking the ruling BJP, Congress leader Anil Yadav said that while the Constitution promotes scientific thinking, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry among citizens, which Mr. Gangwar was trying to promote through his verse, elements in the State government aim to encourage “superstition and irrationality and suppress voices”.\nMeanwhile, in a purported video on Tuesday, Mr. Gangwar said his poem was meant to educate students, and his intention was not to express negative sentiments about the yatra. “If you listen to the whole poem, it was recited to educate children and tell them about incidents happening related tokanwariyas.”\nHe also dared the police to take action against senior National Democratic Alliance(NDA)leader and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president O.P. Rajbhar over his purported comments from 2021: “No one can become a doctor or an engineer from among thekanwariyas. Kanwar Yatra is meant only for unemployed people.” At the time, Mr. Rajbhar, an MLA from Zahoorabad, was part of the Opposition. He joined the ruling NDA in 2023 and is currently a Minister in the State Cabinet."

It called reports on media and commentary on social media as “hasty”.\n“A preliminary report is merely the means of communication used for the prompt dissemination of data obtained during the early stages of the investigation and only contains factual information and an indication of the progress of the investigation,” the statement added.\nAmid demands from pilot bodies for allowing them observer status during the ongoing probe, IFALPA said it was “committed” to supporting the AAIB."

Appadurai, Head of Department, Department of Dental Surgery, Vellore Medical College Hospital; K. Baby John, Dean, Vinayaka Mission Hospital (Salem); and B. Vijay, principal, RVS Dental College and Hospital (Coimbatore).\nThe inspection was led by Mr. Appadurai and the other two were members of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Council. “The dental clinic has remained closed since it was sealed from May 31 on orders of Tirupattur Collector K. Siva Soundaravalli. Action against the clinic will be taken based on the report of the team,”, V. Gnana Meenakshi, Joint Director of Health Services (JDHS), Tirupattur, toldThe Hindu.\nThe team inspected various sections in the clinic. The hour-long inspection also involved interaction with doctors, nurses, and other staff, who worked in the clinic before its closure. As the team completed the inspection, health authorities closed and sealed the facility.\nHealth officials said that closure of the clinic comes in the wake of a study done jointly by CMC Vellore, ICMR-NIE and Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health, which stated that an unsterile surgical instrument was used to open a saline bottle at the clinic. Reuse of the bottle’s contents had led to at least 10 people contracting neuro melioidosis — a bacterial infection of the brain — which allegedly led to the death of eight patients, who got treated there, the study said."

A magistrate’s court had found them guilty and handed down the sentence on June 18.\nThe convicts also included an unsuccessful Congress candidate in the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election. All of them convicted under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), and 341 (wrongful restraint) of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment each, along with the imposition of fine of ₹3,200 each.\nAmong the convicts, Abhishek Chaudhary contested the 2023 Assembly election as a Congress candidate from Jaipur’s Jhotwara constituency and lost. The other convicts in the case were Rajesh Meena, Ravi Kirad, Wasim Khan, Dron Yadav, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Vidyadhar Meel.\nAdditional Sessions Judge Prem Ratan Ojha accepted the contention of the appellants that they would be deprived of their legal rights if the sentence was not suspended. The court granted relief to the convicts and posted the case for further hearing on August 26.\nThe Assembly membership of both Mr. Bhakar and Mr. Yadav remains unaffected following the sentencing, as a legislator can be disqualified only on being convicted for an offence with a two-year sentence or more, as per Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."

So, there is great potential for innovation, he observed after inaugurating IBM’s Ecosystem Incubation Center (EIC) at Infopark Kochi. The EIC has been conceived as a strategic space designed to accelerate innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration across start-ups, enterprises, and academia, while serving as a hub for early-stage ventures, skill-building, and co-innovation.\nEmphasising the need for a “clear understanding and consultation” ahead of introducing AI in the government’s daily operations, Mr. Rajeeve said its implementation would not compromise on privacy and data security. “This kind of a change will be very beneficial to the people,” he pointed out.\nThe Minister recalled that the government had prepared a draft proposal called ‘Industry 4.0’ for the introduction of AI in the industrial sector. “We will take a decision on this after receiving feedback from the industry,” he added.\nKerala has 16 colleges that have made it to the top 100 colleges in the country. Three universities are in the top 20, the Minister pointed out. Mr. Rajeeve also inaugurated a symposium ‘GenAI and Agentic AI for start-ups, academia, and enterprises’.\nIBM Software senior vice president Dinesh Nirmal said Kerala enjoyed an advantage in the availability of skills and operational excellence. The State’s transport connectivity is “excellent” compared to other places, he said, noting that the incubation centre was started to “fully utilise the excellent IT ecosystem” in Kerala.\n“By collaborating with organisations such as the Kerala Startup Mission, Infopark, Technopark, and the academia, we aim to scale the development of impactful software solutions to solve our clients’ hybrid cloud and AI needs,” he added.\nPrincipal Secretary (Industries) A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, KSIDC Managing Director Mir Mohammed Ali, IBM India vice president Vishal Chahal, Infopark CEO Susanth Kurunthil, and representatives of industry associations attended the event."

Hatred in politics spares no one.

    "content": "Though Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in April that ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) had been restored, there has been no attempt by either party to conceal the apparent contradictions between them.\nAt a press conference held jointly with the AIADMK general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Shah said, “We will fight the elections under the leadership of Edappadiji.” He also added that there would be a “coalition government” in the event of a victory. The AIADMK did not react positively to this announcement. It is not just the AIADMK; even the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has always been averse to the idea of a coalition government in Tamil Nadu.\nIn the 1980 Assembly elections, the DMK-Congress combine failed to capture power. The constituents of the coalition contested an equal number of seats. After a round of wrangling with the DMK, the Congress finally agreed that the then DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate. However, the coalition did not click at the hustings. Instead, the AIADMK, which won only two seats in the Lok Sabha elections earlier that year and subsequently lost power in Tamil Nadu, staged a spectacular comeback in the Assembly polls.\nIn 2001, when the AIADMK contested the Assembly elections from 141 seats — the lowest number it has ever contested — in view of coalition compulsion, political circles discussed whether the party would be able to obtain a simple majority of its own. The AIADMK needed to secure 118 seats in the House of 234. The AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa never favoured the concept of sharing power in the State. However, the party had no reason to worry as it won 132 seats.\nIn 2006, the DMK fell short of a simple majority as it won only 96 seats. Yet, it refused to share power with its allies. Karunanidhi and the then Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, shared such a good rapport that the DMK patriarch managed to form the government without sharing power with the Congress.\nAfter making that comment in April, Mr. Shah reiterated his position in many interviews to the media. However, the AIADMK is clearly not on the same page. Alluding to the Union Minister’s stand, AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan said that the concept of a coalition government would “never ever” find acceptance among the people of the State. Similarly, Mr. Palaniswami, who launched a State-wide tour from July 7 in the run-up to the 2026 Assembly elections, has been asserting that the AIADMK will form the government after gaining a majority on its own. When asked to comment on Mr. Shah’s position, he said he interpreted them as an endorsement of single-party rule in the State. Despite the conflicting views of the two parties, the BJP State president, Nainar Nagendran, and Union Minister of State L. Murugan participated in Mr. Palaniswami’s campaign launch.\nIn one interview, Mr. Shah said that the nominee for the post of Chief Minister would be from the AIADMK; he did not mention Mr. Palaniswami’s name. This did not go unnoticed in the DMK circles. The party sought to corner the AIADMK general secretary and saw Mr. Shah’s statement as a lack of confidence in Mr. Palaniswami’s leadership qualities. Eventually, it was left to Mr. Nagendran to clarify that the AIADMK leader would head the government.\nYet, speculation is rife that the Union Minister may have in mind former Municipal Administration Minister in Coimbatore, S.P. Velumani. About three weeks ago, the AIADMK strongman shared the stage with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior BJP leaders at the birth centenary celebration of the pontiff of Perur Mutt, Shanthalinga Ramasamy Adigalar. He later explained that he attended the event, which he termed as “apolitical”, only as a local legislator. Prior to the announcement on the tie up between the two parties, there were reports of differences of opinion between the AIADMK chief and some of his senior colleagues, including Mr. Velumani.\nAs the debate over the nature of government could spoil the narrative for the Opposition parties, it would be in the interest of the alliance to sort out the issue soon. Having said that, it remains inexplicable that this debate is even raging given that the composition of different alliances has not even been finalised yet."

    "content": "Jiten Gohain is the head of one of 218 families evicted during a drive the authorities in Assam’s Lakhimpur district carried out on July 3 to reclaim 78 acres of Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) land across four locations.\nOn July 8, the district’s Sub-Divisional Land Advisory Committee approved the allotment of 1.5 kathas (4,320 sq. ft) of land each to 21 families evicted, in one of the fastest such exercises. Among them were 12 belonging to the Ahom community, which is seeking Scheduled Tribe status, to which Mr. Gohain belongs.\nDistrict Commissioner Pronab Jit Kakoty said the eviction drive was conducted following “due process”. He said the affected families, which failed to produce land ownership documents, were served notices on June 29.\n“I had a larger plot from where we were evicted, but the government has at least provided some space,” Mr. Gohain said.\nAbul Hasan Sheikh, one of some 200-odd Bengali-speaking Muslim families evicted from Lakhimpur, is not sure if the government would be equally “generous” to provide him an alternative plot. He is originally a resident of western Assam’s South Salmara-Mankachar district along the border with Bangladesh.\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma named him and at least a dozen others from faraway districts – most of them Muslim-majority – to underline the alleged “agenda of demographic invasion by strategically occupying lands in areas dominated by indigenous communities”.\n“An analysis has revealed that the families evicted from Lakhimpur included 76 from Barpeta, 63 from Nagaon, seven from Goalpara, and two from South Salmara-Mankachar. Why should someone from South Salmara go to Lakhimpur instead of going to West Bengal, about 50 km away?” Mr. Sarma told reporters on Tuesday.\nThe Chief Minister said more than 50,000 people have been evicted from “protected areas, wetlands, VGR and PGR (Professional Grazing Land), government khas (land owned by the government that has not been settled) and wasteland, and those belonging tosatras (Vaishnav monasteries) andnamghars (prayer halls)” over the past few weeks.\nAccording to the State’s Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation of 1986, the Land Policy of 1989, and a 2011 Supreme Court judgment mandate protection of government and village common lands. It also cites the violation of the Assam Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act of 2010 as a punishable offence.\nAfter the BJP came to power in Assam in May 2016, the first eviction drive was carried out in three fringe villages of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. Two persons, including a minor girl, were killed during the eviction based on a Gauhati High Court order in September 2016.\n“Most of those evicted are listed as voters in places from where they came. We have asked the authorities from where they were evicted to delete their names from the electoral rolls to eliminate duplicate names,” Mr. Sarma said.\nCiting the case of the 12 Ahom families, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union has demanded rehabilitation for the evicted Muslim families. It claimed many people had lands they were evicted from before these were declared as reserve forests.\nThe Opposition parties have criticised the eviction drive for disproportionately targeting the minority communities. “The Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission should take note of the eviction during the court holidays in Assam to target poor Muslims. The government must first provide adequate rehabilitation and only then undertake eviction,” All India United Democratic Front MLA Rafiqul Islam said.\n“The BJP government has been projecting the evicted people as Bangladeshi. The government provided a compensation package of ₹14.72 crore to 332 families evicted from Kaziranga. People evicted [in 2021] for the Gorukhuti project [Darrang district] were compensated and given land in the Dalgaon area. Why is the government doing so if these people are Bangladeshi?” Congress leader and advocate Aman Wadud said.\nOthers pointed out that the Dhubri district administration has asked 1,400 families displaced from Chapar town, reportedly to make space for a thermal power plant by the Adani Group, to relocate to a sandbar in the middle of the Brahmaputra river.\n“The eviction is being carried out for two reasons. Firstly, they want to clear land for corporate houses. Secondly, evicting minorities paves the way for the politics of polarisation... so that the Hindu voters back the BJP, especially in eastern Assam, where it is facing challenges,” Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi said.\nLurinjyoti Gogoi, the chief of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), said eviction drives are a form of the tried-and-tested ploy of weaponising the “Bangladeshi issue” before the poll.\nThe Assembly poll in Assam is due by May 2026.\n“The Chief Minister claims he is doing everything for the indigenous people. In reality, more tribal families have been evicted than the Muslims. In Karbi Anglong, 20,000 Adivasi, Karbi, and Naga families have been evicted to hand over 18,000 bighas of land to the Reliance Group,” the AJP leader claimed. In Assam, one bigha is equivalent to 14,400 sq. ft.\nHe also cited 9,000 bighas of land “to be handed over to the Adani Group” in Dima Hasao district, 45 bighas “taken away” from the Adivasis for a hotel project near Kaziranga, and 75 bighas for a Patanjali project in the Golaghat district. “It is evident why the government is on a land acquisition spree. Of the 49,000 bighas cleared, only 6,000 bighas were under the occupation of the religious minorities,” the AJP leader said."

    "content": "The history section of the newly introduced Class 8 social science textbook by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for students in the current 2025-26 academic year portrays Mughal rulers, especially Babur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb, as “intellectuals” who also “plundered” the Indian population.\nThe second chapter of the textbook, titled ‘Reshaping India’s Political Map in Theme B - Tapestry of the Past’ includes references from theBaburnama, Babur’s autobiography, and describes him as cultured, intellectually curious, and having a keen appreciation of architecture, poetry, flora, and fauna. The textbook also goes on to say that Babur was a ruthless conqueror, slaughtering populations, enslaving women and children, and taking pride in erecting “towers of skulls” in plundered cities.\nAkbar’s reign is described as a blend of “brutality and tolerance”, and that during the seizure of the Chittor fort, Akbar, then 25 years old, ordered the massacre of 30,000 civilians, and the enslavement of women and children, the new textbook states. Akbar’s message is also quote in the textbook: “We have succeeded in occupying a number of forts and towns belonging to infidels and have established Islam there. With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” The textbook says Akbar leaned towards peace in the later years of his reign.\nThe new textbook also states that Aurangzeb issuedfarmansor edicts to demolish schools and temples. “Temples at Banaras, Mathura, Somnath among many others were destroyed, as well as Jain temples and Sikh gurdwaras,” the new textbook says. It also speaks of the persecution of Sufis and Zoroastrians at the hands of the Mughals.\nBabur, Akbar, and Aurangzeb have not been described in such detail in the older NCERT textbook’s chapter on the Mughals, which appeared in the Class 7 History book (‘Our Pasts II’).\nMichel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science. File\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu\n“Indian history cannot be cannot sanitised and presented as a smooth, happy development throughout. There were bright periods but also dark periods where people suffered, so we have given note on the darker chapters of history, and also given a disclaimer that no one today should be regarded as responsible for whatever happened in the past,” Michel Danino, Head, NCERT’s Curricular Area Group for Social Science, toldThe Hindu.\n“You cannot understand them (the Mughal emperors) unless you go into the complexities of their personalities. Akbar himself admits he was brutal in his younger days. We are not demonising Akbar or Aurangzeb, but we have to show these rulers had their limitations and committed cruel deeds,” Mr. Danino said.\nBecause Part One of the earlier released new Class 7 Social Science textbook in April culminated in the pre-Delhi Sultanate era of the 6th century, there was an element of uncertainty on how the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era would find their place in the newly revamped textbooks. While earlier a Class 7 student would have learnt about the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal history, these sections have now been shifted to the first part of the newly released Class 8 textbooks, available in bookstores mid-July onward.\nThe first part of the new Class 8 Social Science textbook, which has combined History, Geography, Civics, and Economics into one title,Exploring Society: India and Beyond, will serve as a resource for the first six months of the academic year for Class 8, NCERT officials clarified. “Part Two textbooks for both Classes 7 and 8 for Social Science will be released in October later this year. Part Two textbooks are currently under development,” officials said.\nThe new Class 8 textbook also has a section on heroic resistance to the Mughals, including on the Jat peasants who managed to kill a Mughal officer; the Bhil, Gond, Santhal and Koch tribal communities, who fought to protect their territories; and Rani Durgavati of one of the Gond kingdoms, who fought against Akbar’s army. Sections have also been added on the escape of Mewar’s ruler Maharana Pratap, and the resistance of the Ahoms to Aurangzeb’s army in northeastern India."

So there's all kinds of weapons, but we have not discussed in detail yesterday with the president.

Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to release water from the expanded Phase-1 canal of the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project on July 17, at the Malyala Pumping Station of Nandikotkur mandal in Nandyal district.\nThe expansion of HNSS Phase-1 canal had been completed, increasing its capacity from 2,200 cusecs to 3,850 cusecs, an official press release said here on Tuesday.\nThis canal was expected to facilitate the transfer of water up to the Jeedipalli Reservoir and beyond, with the government targeting the Chittoor and Punganur branch canals by the end of this month.\nThe expansion, taken up at a cost of ₹696 crore, would enable an additional 1,600 cusecs of water to be carried through the canal network. Officials said the project aimed at addressing the drinking water and irrigation needs of Rayalaseema, covering parts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Chittoor, and Kadapa districts.\nWater from the canal would benefit 6 lakh acres and provide drinking water to approximately 33 lakh people once Phase-1 and Phase-2 become fully operational. Under Phase-1, around 2,906 acres in Nandyal, 77,094 acres in Kurnool, and 1.18 lakh acres in Anantapur were set to receive irrigation supply. Phase-2 was projected to serve 2.27 lakh acres in Anantapur, 37,500 acres in Kadapa, and 1.40 lakh acres in Chittoor.\nThe release also mentioned that the government mobilised efforts to complete 216-km of canal works from Malyala to Jeedipalli, and planned to refill local reservoirs like Jeedipalli, Krishnagiri, Pathikonda, and Gajuladinne. The improved canal capacity was expected to allow full utilisation of the project’s 40 tmc ft water allocation this year — reportedly for the first time in over a decade.\nThe Water Resources Department executed the works over a 100-day period beginning in April 2025. The government plans to complete the remaining Phase-2 works by this month-end and supply water to the tail-end ayacut areas in Punganur and Kuppam.\nA total expenditure of ₹3,890 crore had been earmarked for Phases 1 and 2 of the HNSS project, the release added."

It suggested to enforce statutory timelines and penalties for inaction or misconduct by EROs or District Election Officers (DEOs), empower the State election watch committees to function with observer status during roll revision, mandatory rotation of Block Level Officers (BLOs)/Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to prevent local influence or partisan misuse and appoint a State-level Ombudsman under ECI to handle unresolved political grievances related to the electoral rolls.\nIt has also suggested the ECI to conduct targeted re-enrollment campaigns for migrant workers, tribal groups, elderly people, and homeless citizens, and permit temporary address declarations with basic documentation to prevent disenfranchisement of mobile populations."

He said the government had drafted officials of various departments to receive petitions when only a few months were left for the election. The scheme was aimed at deceiving the electorate into voting for the ruling DMK. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had been concerned only about his family since he entered office in 2021 and launched the scheme now. “Why didn’t he reach out to the people for so long,” he asked.\nUngaludan Stalinwas similar to the exercise undertaken by Mr. Stalin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the run-up to the 2021 election. What was the need for launching a similar exercise when he and his party men had already received petitions. It was nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the people, Mr. Palaniswami said. Furthermore, the initiative was nothing new. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had drafted all revenue officials to receive petitions from the people at their doorsteps. It had been copied and launched as a new scheme to get publicity, he said.\nMr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK government had failed in maintaining law and order. There was no safety for the people. Murders, murders for gain, dacoity, and crimes against women and children were the order of the day. Since the DMK assumed office in 2021, the State had witnessed more than 7,700 murders. Mineral wealth was being looted by the government. A farmer was murdered and another sustained grievous injuries in an assault by the sand mafia in the Manmangalam taluk of Karur district on July 13, he alleged, urging the people to vote out the DMK.\nEarlier, interacting with farmers and representatives of farmers’ associations in Ariyalur district, he said the AIADMK government had provided three-phase power supply to the farmers throughout the day. However, it was stopped by the DMK government. The DMK government had discontinued several other schemes meant for helping the farmers improve productivity. The AIADMK government had provided subsidies to the farmers to buy modern agricultural machines. To prevent malpractices, applications were received online for the selection of beneficiaries. This practice had been halted and only hand-picked farmers were being given the benefits. All the schemes introduced by the AIADMK government for the benefit of farmers would be revived once the party returned to power, he said."

Everyone respected him a lot,\" the villager added.\nAnother local Gurpreet Singh said after the vehicle struck Fauja Singh, he was immediately rushed to hospital.\n\"We took him to hospital... The vehicle which struck him could be an SUV. He suffered injuries to head and other parts of body. Entire village has plunged into sadness after his demise. Our village got global recognition due to him,\" Mr. Gurpreet said.\nOn Tuesday, the Jalandhar police said that efforts are on to trace the erring driver, who had fled after the incident.\nThe last rites of Singh are likely to be conducted after a couple of days, a family member toldPTIon Tuesday.\n\"We have many relatives living abroad including in the U.K. and Canada. So, it may take some time before they reach,\" he said.\nHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said the news of Fauza Singh's demise is deeply saddening.\n\"Living a healthy lifestyle and reaching the age of 114, which seems impossible in today's era, he made possible,\" said Mr. Saini in a post in Hindi on X.\n\"His indomitable energy and message of a healthy lifestyle are a source of inspiration for us all.

Punjab and the world salute his incredible life,\" Bajwa posted on X.\nIn a post on X, Punjab Congress chief Warring wrote, \"Saddened over the untimely death of our legend #FaujaSingh Ji. He was an example of grit, determination and perseverance running marathons well past 100 years.\" \"More shocking is that he fell victim to a hit-and-run incident.

He became the first centenarian to complete a marathon, earning multiple records while participating in international events.\nHe went on to run marathons, including the famed ones in London, New York and Hong Kong, and inspire awe for clocking some brilliant timings for a 90-plus man born with weak legs.\nAmong the most memorable of his runs was in 2011 when he turned 100. The invitational meet in Toronto was named in his honour and he broke several world records for his age group.\nThe frail man, who weathered many personal storms with his resilience and \"nonchalance\", had spent a better part of his running career in Britain and returned to his roots just about three years ago after retiring.\nLast year, Singh, in a symbolic gesture, joined Punjab Governor Gulab Chand Kataria in a walkathon to spread awareness against drug abuse."

This news is extremely saddening,” she said, adding that Upendrakishore was a pillar of Bengal’s Renaissance.\nAccording to the Bangladesh Department of Archaeology, the house was built more than a century ago. After the partition of 1947, the property came under government ownership. Media reports in Bangladesh pointed out that the house has been left abandoned for ten years and a “Shishu Academy’ will be constructed in the place of the building.\nLast month, a political row erupted in West Bengal over theattack on an ancestral house of Rabindranath Tagoreat Sirajganj in Bangladesh, with both the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) highlighting the issue.\nWest Bengal Chief Minister on June 12 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him “take up the matter very strongly with the neighbouring country’s government, so that no stone is left unturned to swiftly bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous and mindless act”."

    "content": "The seemingly impeccably designed Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE), which was once the State’s single window system of intake of students to professional courses like engineering, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary, agriculture and other allied ones, was not bereft of controversies and legal wrangles.\nIn 2004, Anna University, the nodal agency which was tasked with conducting the TNPCEE on behalf of the State government since its inception in 1984, decided to not value 22 questions in different subjects. The break up went like this: seven out of 90 questions in Mathematics were omitted, three out of 60 questions in Physics, 10 out of 60 in Chemistry, and 2 out of 140 in Biology were not valued.\nIt all began when, soon after the exam, there were widespread complaints from candidates and their parents over ambiguity in the answer keys of some of the questions. They said some of the questions were out of syllabus, for some questions the answer keys were wrong and for some other questions, there were multiple correct answers. Anna University was quick to act: it set up an expert panel to evaluate the ambiguous questions and offer a solution. The committee advised deletion of these questions and redistribution of the marks for these questions to the other questions.\nAlso Read |How entrance examinations for professional courses made an entry into Tamil Nadu\nThis invited a flurry of court cases, which stalled the entire admission process for close to two months. Petitions contended these questions carried 8.8 marks and the entire merit list got exhausted within the range of 2-3 marks from the first candidate to the last one.\nSoon after the decision of Anna University was known regarding the ambiguous questions, scores of candidates approached the Madras High Court with various pleas, including setting up of an expert committee to find an acceptable solution and calling for re-examination. The cases were bunched together and heard by a single judge, Justice Prafulla Kumar Misra.\nAfter hearing senior counsels representing many of the candidates, Justice Misra directed Anna University to revalue all answer papers while laying down guidelines for valuing a few specific questions.\nAlso Read |Opposition to entrance tests dates back 3 decades\nJustice Misra’s order stated that “question numbers 27 and 33 in Biology question paper (version code MA-7) and question numbers 11, 64 and 77 of physical science (version code BS6) shall not be deleted and mark should be awarded to any student who has indicated any of the correct choices”. These questions were deleted on the ground that they had more than one correct answer.\nSimilarly, the judge ruled that question number 105 (MA-7) is to be revalued and option number 4 should be taken as the correct answer and not option number 3 as indicated by the committee. This question was: Highly concentrated mineral in the cerebro-spinal fluid is: (1) Pottasium, (2) Sodium, (3) Magnesium, (4) Chlorine.\nThe petitioners, the judgment said, contended that option 4 was the correct answer, which was also the option indicated by the paper setter as the correct answer. The expert committee, however, had suggested that option 3 was the correct answer.\nIn the counter affidavit by Anna University, the committee was stated to have opined that that chlorine being a gas in its natural form could not be considered as mineral and, even though Potassium and Sodium could be classified as minerals, those were not stable in free form and they react violently and become other compound; hence, the only other choice is Magnesium. They have referred to textbook P-239 in support of their opinion. “A perusal of the relevant pages as indicated makes it crystal clear that the question has been set by the paper setter with reference to the discussion relating to chlorine,” the judgment asserted.\nAlso Read |Tamil Nadu’s turbulent relationship with professional course entrance tests\nWhile some petitioners appealed against Justice Misra’s judgment, there were a few pending writ petitions before the High Court against considering improvement candidates on par with regular Plus Two students. All these petitions were bunched and placed before the First Bench comprising Justice Subhashan Reddy, the then Chief Justice of Madras High Court, and Justice Prabha Sridevan.\nAfter hearing both sides, the First Bench directed Anna University to revalue 11 of the questions that were not valued. It also came down heavily on Anna University for reviewing answer keys of paper setters by an expert committee. “The paper setter chooses questions from question bank where the key answers are already provided. By setting up the expert committee, the paper setter is reduced to just a clerk, as the key answer which is indicated has got absolutely no weightage as against the opinion of the expert committee as the University conducting the examination only takes note of the views of the expert committee for awarding marks. This practice has to be discontinued,” the order read.\nAnna University was directed to “take necessary steps to recompute and hold fresh counselling accordingly by including improvement candidates also”. The process of admission finally resumed on August 10 after nearly a two-month ordeal for the candidates and their parents."

    "content": "The experts of the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, have proposed a seawall along the Uppada coast in Kakinada district at a cost of ₹323 crore, recommending it as an immediate way to check the alarming speed of erosion.\nOn July 3, the NCCR experts began technical investigation along the Uppada coast in response to a request by Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan.\nMr. Pawan explained the NCCR experts about the challenges and displacement of the coastal communities due to erosion, which was on the rise since the geo-tube began to sweep away into the sea. The Kakinada-Uppada road, which leads towards Kakinada Special Economic Zone has also been damaged due to erosion.\nPrior to 2010, the 1.5 km-long geo-tube was installed along the Uppada coast. However, it could not withstand the giant waves, which dismantled the tube and ate into the fisherfolks habitations at Nemam, Ameenabad, Subbampeta, Komaragiri.\nAccording to the State Department of Survey, the Uppada coast has lost 1,360 acres of land since 2020 at the rate of 1.23 m per year and the maximum of 26.3 m of land had been lost to erosion during 2017-18.\nReferring to the NCCR’s proposal for the seawall, Kakinada MP Tangella Uday said, “The NCCR has proposed for a seawall with an estimated cost of ₹323 crore. On July 30, the proposal will be discussed by the National Disaster Management Authority in New Delhi. Secretary to Home Ministry Govind Mohan will chair the meeting.”\nIn 2021, the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS-Pune) has recommended a five-km seawall with a five-layer geomaterial to arrest the erosion along the Uppada coast, with an estimated cost of ₹176 crore."

    "content": "Former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj (1903-75), 122nd whose birth anniversary was celebrated on July 15, 2025 was known for organisational skills as well as fortifying the Congress in Tamil Nadu.\nIn his long career, he had shepherded the national party in the State so ably that the Congress won most of the electoral battles since 1946. Of course, in 1967 and 1971 Assembly polls, the limits of Kamaraj’s leadership qualities and electoral judgement came to the fore.\nThere were, however, two electoral contests - bye-elections to the Gudiyatham Assembly constituency in 1954 and to the Nagercoil (now called Kanniyakumari) Lok Sabha seat in 1969 - wherein he was a principal player and on both occasions, he achieved success with finesse. The two bye-elections had one common feature: both were held in regions outside his native district - Ramanathapuram, under which Virudhunagar [the place of his birth] fell between 1910 and 1985.\nThe need for contesting in the Gudiyatham bye-election arose for Kamaraj as he had to become a member of the legislature following his appointment as Chief Minister in April 1954. Even though the legislature of Tamil Nadu was bi-cameral then, Kamaraj did not choose to become a member of the Upper House (Legislative Council) unlike his predecessor C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji or CR) did in 1952. One of his successors C.N. Annadurai (CNA) used CR’s path in 1967. Also, there was a controversy over the way Rajaji became a Member of the Legislative Council P. Ramamurti, the Marxist theoretician and then in the undivided Communist Party of India (CPI), had unsuccessfully challenged CR’s nomination in the Madras High Court.\nKamaraj, who hailed from Virudhunagar in the southern belt of the State, was a Member of Parliament at the time of becoming the Chief Minister. The vacancy in the Legislative Assembly had existed only for Gudiyatham, which was part of the erstwhile North Arcot district (now split into Vellore, Ranipet, Thirupathur and Tiruvannamalai districts). At that time, Gudiyatham was a double-member constituency with one seat reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC).\nWhile Kamaraj, in June 1954, made it clear to the party that he would like to enter the fray for the general seat, the Scheduled Castes’ Federation (SCF), established by B.R. Ambedkar, had approached him with a request to let the Congress adopt its member for the reserved seat, according to a report of The Hindu on June 22, 1954. The report had even mentioned that [in the event of the request being accepted,] “this will be the first time” for the Congress and the SCF to have an electoral understanding. However, this proposal did not fructify, possibly due to the tense ties between Ambedkar and the Congress at the all-India level. Eventually, the SCF was left to put up its own candidate in Gudiyatham. For the reserved seat, the Congress’ nominee was T. Manavalan and the Federation’s, M. Krishnaswami.\nEven though the Congress’ candidate was the Chief Minister himself, the ruling party did not take chances. Two Central Ministers - Maragatham Chandrasekhar, who was Deputy Minister for Health, and T.T. Krishnamachari (TTK), Union Minister for Industry and Commerce - were drafted for the poll work, apart from C. Subramaniam, ranked no. 2 in the Kamaraj Cabinet and Finance Minister.\nThe Chief Minister’s principal rival was K. Kothandaraman of the CPI. Veteran journalist T.S. Chockalingam, in his biography of the former Chief Minister, mentions that members of the Congress all over the State had “turned their attention” towards Gudiyatham and “friends” from every district had begun their campaign for Kamaraj. There was “one more miracle” - the Dravidar Kazhagam and the Muslim League declaring publicly their support for him and commencing their canvassing.\nAlso Read |When BJP talks of Kamaraj rule…\nKamaraj was not one who would get carried away by “such widespread support.” He plunged himself in the campaign and carried out his work in villages. With a few weeks to go for the date of polling, he had covered 100 out of 160 villages in the constituency, The Hindu wrote on July 18, 1954. Responding to the criticism of the Communists that the Congress, despite being in power at the Centre and in States, had not resolved many problems of the country, Kamaraj, at a meeting in Cherlapalli, wondered how “age-long difficulties” of people could be removed within seven years of the country gaining Independence. Krishnamachari told the voters that Kamaraj was the “friend and follower” of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Being a person conscious of the living standards of the poor, he would “do his best” to raise them, TTK assured the voters.\nWhen the result was out on August 4, 1954, it was on expected lines. Kamaraj had defeated the CPI’s candidate by a comfortable margin - about 38,000 votes. That was the only occasion when the former Chief Minister was a candidate in the northern region of the State.\nNearly 15 years later, the political field in the State was not that benign either to Kamaraj or to the Congress. In early 1967, the national party was dislodged from power in the State nearly after a 20-year-long rule. Kamaraj himself lost in the Virudhunagar assembly constituency to a lightweight of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Spearheaded by CNA, the DMK, which had stitched a rainbow coalition comprising the Swatantara and the CPI (Marxist), had captured power in a stunning fashion. At the Centre, though the Congress was in power, there had been changes in the balance of power. The “old guard” in the ruling party was experiencing the phase of decline and naturally, there had been reports of difference between the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and some of her Cabinet colleagues, who were considered members of the “old guard.” As the Congress’ pre-eminent position in the country’s politics had started waning, new political forces were emerging.\nThe death of ‘Marshal’ A. Nesamony had necessitated the bye-election to the Nagercoil Lok Sabha constituency. Kamaraj, who was looking for an opportunity to regain people’s confidence after the Virudhunagar defeat, announced his candidature on December 1, 1968, this newspaper reported the next day. There were six other contestants. But, the battle was between him and M. Mathias, who was backed by the DMK-led alliance that included the Swatantara and the Muslim League.\nOrdinarily, Nagercoil should not have been difficult terrain for the Congress, which had a strong base even then, as is now. Besides, even in 1967, when the national party was thrashed in most of the districts, five out of six assembly constituencies, which formed Nagercoil, went in favour of the Congress. But, it was the DMK, which had decided to make the contest more intense.\nFormer Congress leader Pazha Nedumaran, in his “Perunthalaivarin Nizhalil” [In the shadow of great leader (meaning Kamaraj)], stated that the bye-election had been turned into another “Kurukshetra War,” the entire credit for which should go to the then Public Works Minister M. Karunanidhi and former Assembly Speaker Si. Pa. Aditanar, who later became a Minister in the DMK Cabinet headed by Karunanidhi. In the assessment of Mr Nedumaran, the DMK leaders had entertained the notion that if Kamaraj had tasted defeat [the possibility of which could not be ignored especially after Virudhunagar], he could be driven out of the politics of Tamil Nadu.\nWith the election fever mounting, the atmosphere was “getting surcharged” with a stream of lorries bringing supporters of rival parties from outside the district, The Hindu wrote on January 5, 1969, three days before the date of polling. “In the last 10 days, the Police have arrested about 200 persons, most of them Congressmen in connection with election clashes,” the newspaper reported. The then Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief, C.Subramaniam (CS), accused the DMK of bringing in “hired hooligans” from the neighbouring Tiruneveli district. Karunanidhi, who had overseen the campaign of Mathias, challenged CS’s allegations and put the blame on the Congress, which, he said, was “indulging in violence.” As for the complaint regarding the involvement of senior DMK Ministers in the campaign, Karunanidhi reasoned his party was “only following the example” set by the Congress. Kamaraj’s response was his party had refrained from inviting Union Ministers to campaign in the constituency, even though they were “ready to come.”\nThe bye-election frenzy rose to the boiling point on the midnight of January 4 when a worker of the DMK, Kittu, was killed and two others suffered stab injuries. That day, the head of the State police (which was called Inspector General) R.M. Mahadevan reached Nagercoil to oversee the preparations. The Superintendent of Police S. Dayasankar chose to go on medical leave for a month. He was immediately replaced by K. Srikumara Menon, Deputy Commissioner, Traffic. Madurai. On the day of polling (January 8), the then Chief Election Commissioner, S.P. Sen Verma, himself visited as many as 35 polling stations of the constituency, according to this newspaper. Given the high-decibel campaign, the voter turnout exceeded 75%, a few percentage points higher than what Nagercoil recorded in 1967.\nThere was no element of great surprise in the result. Kamaraj won the bye-election by a huge margin of 1,28,201 votes over Mathias, by polling 2,49,437 votes.\nCommenting on the former Chief Minister’s electoral battles, A. Gopanna, who had also authored his biography, feels Kamaraj always attached greater emphasis on drawing support from the people directly than anything else. R. Kannan, a biographer of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai and M.G. Ramachandran apart from writing ‘The DMK Years’, says Kamaraj, by contesting in Nagercoil, had “wanted to stay relevant.”\nKamaraj’s participation in the two bye-elections had only shown how much importance he, as a political leader, had paid to securing legitimacy from the public."

    "content": "Amid the ongoing row over alleged imposition of Hindi in schools through the National Education Policy (NEP), Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has defended the Union government’s proposal, saying that the former Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, has become a famed scholar by learning 17 languages.\n“P.V. Narasimha Rao was a scholar, fluent in 17 language. Now, we are talking why should we learn Hindi. Narasimha Rao had become a great man as he not only learnt Hindi but other languages too,” Mr. Naidu said while delivering the sixth of the PMs’ lecture series on the topic, ‘The life and legacy of P.V. Narasimha Rao’, at the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library, in New Delhi on Tuesday.\nDeputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan and HRD Minister N. Lokesh had already unequivocally supported promoting Hindi as a language.\nMr. Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party and Mr. Naidu-led TDP are partners in the NDA from South India.\nRecalling Narasimha Rao’s contribution in nation-building, Mr. Naidu, “I had a very good equation with him and knew him very well. The Telugu community is proud of him. He was a true ‘Telugu Bidda’ who had reshaped the destiny of our great nation,” Mr. Naidu observed.\nSpeaking about the pre-1991 economic scenario, Mr. Naidu outlined how the country had been shackled under the ‘License Raj’, with growth stagnating at 3-4%. By 1991, India was saddled in an unprecedented economic crisis, and foreign reserves dropped dangerously low, he said.\nComparing Narasimha Rao’s strategic courage to that of Deng Xiaoping of China, who initiated China’s reforms in 1978, Mr. Naidu said the former Prime Minister had recognised crisis as an opportunity and launched the historic 1991 economic reforms, decisively transforming India’s future. “We are all here today enjoying the fruits of the reforms he initiated,” Mr. Naidu asserted.\nPraising the political acumen of Narasimha Rao, the Chief Minister said, despite leading a minority government, he had achieved the near-impossible by forging consensus among Socialists, Communists, and Capitalists alike. Narasimha Rao had played a key role in ending the License Raj and welcoming foreign investment, and setting the stage for India’s IT revolution in the mid-1990s.\n“Thanks to his reforms, India overcame its balance of payments crisis, opened up its economy, and set the stage for future growth,” Mr. Naidu said.\nHe credited Narasimha Rao with the IT boom that was witnessed after the economic liberalisation. The Chief Minister also recalled his association with the former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, recognising his vision in building India’s infrastructure and telecom backbone.\nFurther, Mr. Naidu described 2014 as a turning point, and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with ushering in a new era of bold, decisive leadership. “Under Mr. Modi’s stewardship, India rose from the 11th to the 4th largest economy, with a clear trajectory to become the 3rd largest by 2028,” Mr. Naidu emphasised.\n“Mr. Modi is as a leader who instills national pride, global respect, and strong foreign relations,” he said. Drawing comparisons to other economies, he remarked that “the goal is not just to grow fast, but to grow fairly, where every citizen, every region, and every sector shares fruits of progress, rightly called Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.”\nHe also noted that according to the World Bank, India was among the top four most income-equal countries, lifting over 17.1 crore Indians out of poverty in the last decade.\n“Public policy must serve the people. For it to work effectively, we need stable governments and visionary leaders,” Mr. Naidu asserted. He highlighted India’s global recognition in space, healthcare, entrepreneurship, and the rise of Indian billionaires as symbols of this transformation.\nLater, Mr. Naidu took questions from the audience during which he elaborated his vision for Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the technology sector. He said that the Quantum Valley initiative was in line with the National Quantum Mission, aiming to create India’s answer to Silicon Valley. He highlighted curriculum reforms, youth leadership in his party, and a conscious effort to bring young, educated MLAs into governance.\nOn agriculture, he said, “We must handhold agriculture as our traditional occupations evolve.” On equitable wealth distribution, he emphasised the need to align the aspirations of farmers with broader policy reforms.\nMr. Naidu added, “I am 100% confident that by 2047, India will be the No. 1 country in the world. When we celebrate 100 years of Independence, Indians will lead the world.” The Chief Minister felicitated the former Prime Minister’s son, P.V. Prabhakar Rao, and grandson N.V. Subhash on the occasion."

It made its appearance late in the 19thcentury, chiefly as a game for cricket players to keep fit during the off season. ‘Playing hooky’ which meant going away from your official duties was an expression that came due to this. Interestingly, hockey or hooky was initially played in Madras without any knowledge of the rules of the game. The first record of it in the city dates back to 1894.\nThe Madras Hockey Tournament, played for “the Silver Cup presented by the Madras Cricket Club”, was the forerunner of what became the MCC All-India Hockey Tournament. The first announcement of this trophy appeared in the Madras Mail on July 20, 1901. The very first of its kind in South India, it commenced on July 22. Here again, as in cricket, we find the Madras United Club doing its bit to get Indians to play the game. The MUC’s XI, South India’s first ‘native team’ took to the field against the 25thBattery, Royal Field Artillery, from Bangalore. The MUC, judging by the report of the match, appears to have known little of the game, and was trounced 15-0. The next day, the MCC ‘A’ team appears to have played the eventual winner of the tournament, the Durham Light Infantry, with a detailed report of the match being carried by the Madras Mail. Newspaper reports referred to ‘dangerous play’ being a feature of the game.\nBy the 1920s, the game had come into its own especially with R.C. Summerhayes of Burma Shell, and a hockey blue from Oxford, taking special interest. He got the legendary M.J. Gopalan interested in the game. By the 1930s, Anglo Indian teams of Madras were taking the game to new heights. The Madras Hockey Association came into being in 1931. When it came to Indian participation in the Olympics, Madras produced its share of hockey players by way of R. Francis, Munir Sait, V. Baskaran, V.J. Philips, V.J. Peter and Krishnamurthy Perumal. We can also include Charles Cornelius here though he mainly played for Punjab.\nThe MCC All India Hockey Trophy was one of the big attractions during that golden era for the game. Teams from all over the country came to participate. But even then, there were breaks despite best efforts. The Murugappa Group, with its Murgappa Gold Cup instituted in 1962 to commemorate the 60thbirthday of A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar, joined the MCC in 1996 and since then the game has seen a fresh lease of life.\nThe semi-finals and finals of the ongoing tournament will take place on July 19 and 20 respectively. Initially played at Chepauk in the MCC’s B Ground, it has moved to the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium in recent times. For the first time this year, an overseas team, from Malaysia, is participating. And there is a third umpire to refer to. Finally, ten trees will be planted for every goal."

    "content": "Kolkata\nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers who are responsible for the improvement of nutrition and health of children are still awaiting their budget allocation, months after the declarations were made by the West Bengal government in February. Workers’ unions took out protest rallies in the city to demand increased budget allocation in nutrition, job security and permanent employment.\nThe rally was led by West Bengal Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union and All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) union of Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist). They took out three rallies and filed a deputation with the Governor of West Bengal, one at Nabanna (State Secretariat), addressing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and one at Bikash Bhawan (Child Welfare Department).\nUnion Secretary Madhavi Pandit said that if the demands are not met through the peaceful protest deputation, the workers will have to go on a larger strike in the coming days.\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, another leader and ICDS worker from Murshidabad, Arifa Begum, who led the protest rally that went to Nabanna, said that as they do much of their work online, they have not been provided with smartphones to sustain the work.\n“The CM has only assured us, but there is no action on the ground. Both mother and child will lose out on their basic rights if we do not get the bare minimum. They give us ₹167 for mobile recharge. In the current economy, this is not even enough for a basic recharge to get enough data to do our work,” Ms. Begum added.\nThe workers also demanded that they get permanent job roles and fixed salaries for their labourious work. Nanda Patra, a leader of AIUTUC said that the ICDS workers are demanding that they get life insurance if anyone dies during work and a pension scheme when they retire to offer them better security.\nOn February 12, the West Bengal State budget for 2025-26 allocated ₹200 crore for the purchase of smartphones for about 70,000 ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) and Anganwadi workers. But workers say that they have not received any benefits from it even after five months.\nAnganwadi workers and ASHA workers (Accredited Social Health Activists) are the frontline healthcare workers in every community across districts and rural areas in States, helping bridge the gap between people and public healthcare systems. A major part of their job role is to provide essential services including nutritional supplements to children under six, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.\nHowever, in most States across India they are not permanent employees and do not have any employee benefits and struggle with budget issues. They are paid on contractual or honorarium basis which had led to many protests across the nation, including multiple in West Bengal."

    "content": "India’s diversity in religion and language is one of the primary factors which protects the secular character of the nation, ensuring its unity and integrity. But while religion and language are the two most crucial aspects of any culture, these are also the predominant cross-cultural barriers. This is clearly visible in recent communal tensions and the violence in Maharashtra.\nSecularism in India is different from what the West practises. When the concept originated in England in the mid-19th century, it was explained that there should be complete separation between the state and religion without criticising any of the prevalent religious beliefs. India too accepted this notion and incorporated the concept in the Constitution in the form of rights to religious freedom. These rights are based on the principles of religious tolerance and equality. Every person has the equal right to freedom of conscience and to profess, practise and propagate his religion. This makes India truly secular as the state does not have its own religion. However, the unique aspect of Indian secularism is not only related to religion but it is also concerned with language. Indian secularism is neither pro-religion or language, nor against. Yet it is not neutral either. It is incorporated in the Constitution as a state policy and it empowers the state to take steps against communalism, be it religious or linguistic.\nThis is the reason why we do not and cannot have a national language. In order to protect linguistic diversity, the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution includes 22 languages. As India is a unitary federation, that is, a Union of States, Article 343 enshrines that the official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The States are free to choose their own official language. This arrangement is due to the fact that in India, States are culturally integrated and no State is permitted to go out of it in the name of distinct language or culture.\nArticle 29 incorporates that any section of citizens of India including minority groups shall have the right to protect their language, script or culture, and that language cannot be the ground for discrimination. According to the 2011 Census, India has 121 languages and 270 mother tongues. About 96.71% population of the country have one of the 22 scheduled languages as their mother tongue. Finally, the Census says that the 121 languages are presented in two parts, languages included in the Eighth Schedule, and languages not included (99) in the Eighth Schedule.\nSuch diversity needs to be protected; each and every language irrespective of region or State must be shown respect. This is the only way to protect India’s linguistic secularism. Many southern and northeastern States have resisted the imposition of Hindi, citing fears of cultural domination. Dravidian movements in Tamil Nadu historically opposed Hindi imposition, favouring Tamil and English. Maharashtra, however, has emerged as the most sensitive State so far as the language debate is concerned. The recent violence against the non-Marathi population is the manifestation of identity politics. Definitely, it is not to protect its cultural identity. Had it been related to the protection of culture, the “protectors” of Marathi language would have considered that ‘tolerance’ and ‘liberality’ are the two pillars of India’s unity in diversity.\nIndia has always accepted different religions, ideas, lifestyles, food habits etc., mainly because of its liberal and tolerant attitude. In a globalising world, a conservative leaning towards religion or language will lead to a fragmentation of society and tear apart the secular fabric.\nPolitical parties have the onus to ensure the protection of India’s diversity which has been well shielded by the Constitution.\nC.B.P.

Maritime Board (APMB). The scheduled date of completion of the project was June 23, 2025.\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of the APMB sought the government’s guidance on the proposal for enhancement of the existing infrastructure to ensure the port’s commercial viability and its ability to handle the projected cargo volume of 34.04 MMTPA — primarily coal and iron ore — stating that it was essential to increase the port’s draft from 16m to 18.5m.\nThis would enable the port to accommodate Cape size and Super Cape size vessels, aligning its capabilities with regional and global shipping trends such as additional dredging at approach channel and berth pockets, additional railway lines up to the proposed backup yard behind three multi-purpose berths, development of backup yard infrastructure for storage of cargo, movement of trucks, and operation of material handling equipment, and additional external road connectivity and internal road connectivity within the port.\nThe APMB also requested Extension of Time (EoT) up to April 27, 2026, to the contractor for completion of the works due to analysis of work stoppages, delays in land handover, etc.\nTo consider the proposal, the GoM was constituted and asked to submit its  report / recommendations at an early date."

She also alleged that excess water release from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has led to flooding in many districts in the lower Damodar region, however, DVC has denied all allegations of unplanned water release.\nMs. Banerjee said that even after repeated warnings, the multiple dams of DVC have released heavy loads of water from Jharkhand and flooded West Bengal. She added that as Bengal is a land of water bodies filled with rivers, lakes, and ponds it suffers more during monsoons. She claimed that five lakh ponds have been dug up in the State in recent years to absorb some of the rainwater and reduce the burden on people.\nPlaces like Paschim Medinipur districts Ghatal, parts of Purba Bardhaman district, Khanakul, Arambagh in Hooghly district and Amta, Udaynarayanpur in Howrah district, and other places have been grappling with water logging for the past few weeks.\n“Be it DVC, Panchet, Maithon, none of them are listening to us. We have asked the Central government to do desilting work so they can hold an extra 4 lacs metric cusec water and help with this crisis. They have released over 27,000 lacs cubic meters of water between June 18 to July 15,” Ms. Banerjee said. She also said that they have been fighting this battle with the DVC water release and flooding for over 15 years but to no avail.\nHowever, DVC sources toldThe Hinduthat they release water only after discussions with the committee which includes West Bengal government, Jharkhand government and the DVC authorities along with the Central Water Commission. “They take view of all the stakeholders and advices about water release and we follow that order only, we do not decide water release amount on our own,” a top level official at the DVC who wanted remain anonymous said.\nThe CM also alleged that she has conducted multiple meetings and has urged the central government to find a solution. “People are facing huge losses. Assam gets flood relief money; we do not. They only release water here and abandon us... They get votes saying they will work for people, after the votes they only work for themselves,” Ms. Banerjee added.\nShe asked all government administrative officials to maintain vigil and constantly monitor the flood situation closely and to create more relief centers than before to help people affected by the floods. The CM asked officials to keep snake bite anti-venom in stock and ensure that no open electric lines cause any electrocution accidents."

Within a month, the party will expand, motivating people to join the party,” said former Minister Mr. Shinde.\nNCP-SP Supremo Sharad Pawar announced Mr. Shinde’s appointment at a party’s State executive meeting at the Y.B. Chavan Centre in Mumbai in the presence of prominent leaders from the party, including Jayant Patil, former Minister Anil Deshmukh, Kalwa legislator Jitendra Awhad, and Harshvardhan Patil.\nAfter the poor performance at the 2024 Assembly elections, Mr. Patil expressed his desire to resign and hand over to a new leader. Over the past few days, the resignation of Jayant Patil, who stayed back with Sharad Pawar’s NCP after the split in 2023 and the appointment of Shashikant Shinde was speculated. Mr. Shinde’s name has been announced ahead of the upcoming local body elections in the State, aiming to yield good results for the party.\nReferring to the vacuum in Maharashtra’s politics, the 62-year-old Mr. Shinde said, “Currently, space is there for Opposition. If we try to fill this space, people will relate and stand with us.”\nMr. Shinde also highlighted that politics have changed; earlier, the government changed when the opposition raised public concerns, now the government is changing using the resources and system of government.\nA commerce graduate and popularly known as the Mathadi workers’ leader, he began his political career in 1999, winning the Jaoli Assembly elections and later serving as Water Resources Minister.\n“This is not the end, it is the beginning of a new era,” Jayant Patil expressed his feelings through poetry. After offering his resignation, Mr. Patil touched on his tenure and the party’s journey of providing opportunities to people from ordinary families, shattering the nepotism.\n“The party broke the norms and gave opportunities to young people, including Mehboob Sheikh, Sakshana Salgar, and Sunil Gavane. Sharad Pawar gave strength to people who started from zero and gave them strength. I have been president for the last seven years; otherwise, I have been working in this party for the last 25 years. It is the right time to make way for others to take this opportunity,” he added\nMr. Patil reflected on the 2024 Assembly elections and stated that the match had been fixed Umpire. Reflecting on the government’s policy, he said, “We have a big challenge to preserve theSwarajyacreated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The State has been subjected to religious fanaticism and corruption on the pretext of development. The atrocities against women have increased, while farmers are in a dreadful situation. The government is proving incapable of keeping its promises.”"

    "content": "On the 71st convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) director Dr. Suman Chakraborty said “the world does not need more technocrats”, highlighting the institute’s renewed focus on human-centric, multidisciplinary technology research.\n“Let me be clear: the world does not need more technocrats. It needs humans who can think and feel — who can use algorithms, but are not ruled by them. The future belongs to those who can combine emotional intelligence with technical intelligence,” the director said.\nIn an exclusive interaction with select media, Mr. Chakraborty elaborated that earlier, technocrats relied on extensive research and skill-learning, whereas in the current day scenario, AI systems like ChatGPT can generate answers to most science and tech questions.\n“Unfortunately, it will take a whole lot of time to create a four-year undergraduate programme where answers will not be generable by ChatGPT. So, when these things are already there, students have to elevate themselves where they can innovate, interpret between lines, converge between domains, and come up with solutions that are both technologically advanced as well as human-centric,” the director said.\nHe added that IIT KGP is looking to equip future students with the knowledge of using AI more ethically.\nMr. Chakraborty also highlighted how the research on AI, deeptech, cloud computing, etc., at IIT KGP is advancing in converging domains, with a mix of traditional and non-traditional subjects like AI in diagnostics, medicine, law, humanities, etc.\n“In terms of research on AI, we are also thinking of exploring certain domains where the research will be led by non-AI domain experts… Usually, the engineering and science departments kick off science and tech projects, taking humanities and social sciences as complementary aspects in some cases. In that way, we are concerned with how AI can be more empathetically used to bridge the gap between AI and humans,” he said.\nMr. Chakraborty also said that IIT KGP is pushing boundaries with research across cybersecurity, AI, cloud computing, and disease modelling. He added that the AI models designed by the institute are being used for disaster response and precision agriculture.\n“Our AI department, now a full-fledged academic unit, offers BTech., MTech., and interdisciplinary dual degree programs. It has become a national leader in responsible and explainable AI with real-world applications in healthcare, climate, and linguistics, and with emphasis on human-centric AI… we are therefore not just building machines, we are building meaning,” he added.\nThe Director also unveiled PLATO, an AI-powered coding tutor that offers real-time, personalised guidance to students learning computer programming.\nThe director said that the institute is working on its “shortcomings” to make itself a more preferred choice for nationwide talent.\n“We are good at classroom teaching, but beyond that, we are working on improving infrastructure, improving quality of life, and making campus life more vibrant. We should connect everything. As part of our Platinum Jubilee, we are also building a special amenities centre, an all-in-one unit that can help students have an enjoyable lifestyle while facilitating all-round growth,” Mr. Chakraborty said.\nMr. Chakraborty also touched upon the global gender disparity in science, technology, medicine and engineering,\n“Women are not just contributors — they are disruptors, creators, and changemakers — and at IIT KGP, we thrive not merely to preach this spirit but portray the same in practice,” he added.\nNotably, gender ratios in several branches of the IIT remain skewed despite girl students excelling in all-India examinations. On Tuesday, less than half of the graduating students being awarded prestigious medals at IIT KGP’s convocation ceremony were women.\nThis year, IIT KGP awarded a total of 3,731 degrees across various disciplines, including 277 PhD, 18 MS, 956 M.Tech, 50 MCP, 142 MBA, 23 EMBA, 58 PGDBA, 5 MMST, 28 MHRM, 18 M.Arch, 47 LLM, 31 LLB, 786 Dual Degree, 614 B.Tech (Hons), 46 B.Arch (Hons), 151 Four-Year B.S, 260 Five-Year M.Sc, 214 Two-Year M.Sc, 3 M.Sc M.Tech, 3 Three-Year M.Sc, and 1 Certificate of Excellence in Research (CER).\nAwards such as the President’s Gold Medal, Prime Minister’s Gold Medal, and others were conferred upon graduating students and scholars.\nDr. S. Somanath, former chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was the chief guest."

    "content": "For years, Kumari Hema* never truly belonged anywhere. A 32-year-old mother of one, she moved from colony to colony in Hyderabad, chased by whispers, evicted by landlords, and judged by neighbours who recoiled the moment they learnt the truth: that she was a survivor of sexual assault.\n“We used to skip meals just to pay ₹3,500 in rent for a place that barely felt like a home,” she recalled, her voice quivering with emotion. “Even then, the owners would harass us,” she said.\nThat burden, she says, has now been lifted.\nHema is one of several survivors who have been allotted a 2BHK flat in newly-built community housing in the city’s emerging residential hubs. This is part of an initiative by the Telangana government under its Indiramma Indlu housing scheme. The homes are being allotted to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) victims of serious crimes, including rape and murder cases, where convictions have been secured, with the aim of offering safety, dignity and a fresh start.\n“Now, no one can ask me to leave. I have a house of my own. My name is on the patta certificate. For someone whose name was once on an FIR, this feels like a real identity,” she said, smiling through her eyes.\nFor 27-year-old Sonal*, life too had come to a halt after she was sexually assaulted. A promising engineering student at the time, she dropped out of college and retreated from the world due to the trauma and pain the incident brought. Now, years later, she has cleared the Telangana Law Common Entrance Test and is preparing to start an LLB course through distance education in about a month.\n“I stopped believing that a future was even possible,” the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) victim said. “But things are changing. I’ve got a second chance in my studies, in my marriage, and now in my own new home.” Sonal, who works part-time as a teacher got married six months ago and is about to move into her new flat with her husband. She is already scouting for nearby schools to work at while continuing her education.\nSudha Laxmi*, 35, a mother of two and a domestic worker, has lived in the same locality for nearly three decades. But familiarity did not spare her from stigma after she was assaulted, even after the perpetrator was convicted. “Neighbours never let me forget it. I faced taunts for years,” she said. “I’m relieved to leave it all behind.”\nThe women are waiting for final plumbing and electrical work to be completed before they shift into the apartments, built as part of the first phase of the government’s broader housing initiative for atrocity victims. Under this phase, 43 survivors in Cyberabad and 25 from Rachakonda have been allotted homes.\nThe district’s SC Development Wing, in collaboration with the police, compiles lists of eligible victims. These are cases from 2014 onwards that ended in conviction. The focus, officials say, is on verified cases to avoid legal complications and ensure security.\n“These are people who were not just victims of crime, but also of societal neglect. The least we can do is give them a sense of belonging,” said a senior police officer associated with the project.\n“The entire process is handled discreetly. In most cases, they are moved into neighbourhoods where others from their community already live.”\nThe 2BHK homes themselves are simple but sufficient. Each flat is 560 square feet, with two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen, and two bathrooms. The kitchen opens out onto a small balcony with a washing area. Many occupants have chosen to upgrade the flooring, add tiles or false ceilings, or personalise the space in a small but meaningful ways.\n*Names have been changed to protect the identities of the survivors."

During their journey, the woman, who was pregnant, went into labour and gave birth to a baby boy. However, the couple wrapped the newborn in a piece of cloth and threw him out of the vehicle,” the official said.\nThe driver of the sleeper bus, which has compartments with upper and lower berths, noticed that something was thrown out of a window. When he enquired about it, Shaikh told him that his wife had vomited as she felt nauseated due to the bus journey, he said.\n“Meanwhile, when an alert citizen on the road checked what was thrown out of the bus window, he was shocked to find that it was a baby boy. He immediately alerted the police by calling their 112 helpline,” he said.\nA team of the local police on patrolling duty subsequently intercepted the bus. After inspecting the vehicle and conducting a preliminary probe, they took the woman and Shaikh into custody, the official said.\nThe couple said they dumped the newborn as they were unable to raise the child, he said, adding that the baby died after being thrown on the road.\nAccording to the police, Dhere and Shaikh both hailed from Parbhani and were staying in Pune for the last one-and-a-half years. They claimed to be husband and wife but failed to produce any document to support the claim, the official said.\n“After taking them into custody, the police rushed the woman to a hospital for treatment,” he said.\nA case was registered against the couple at Pathri police station in Parbhani under section 94 (3), (5) of BNS (concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body), he said.\nA notice has been served to the accused persons, and further probe in the case was underway, he said."

    "content": "For 12 long years, 29 tribal families from the Kodarvi community lived in exile, forced to leave their ancestral village of Mota Pipodra in Danta taluka in Banaskantha district due to an age-old custom known as ‘Chadotaru’—a tradition rooted in vengeance. But now, these families, comprising around 300 members, will finally return home, on Thursday (July 17, 2025).\nThe Kodarvi families had migrated to Palanpur and Surat over a decade ago, leaving behind their homes, land, and memories. The ‘Chadotaru’ custom, which had led to disputes, made life in the village untenable for them. For years, they lived as outsiders, yearning to return but bound by fear and tradition.\nRecognising their plight, the Banaskantha police initiated a meticulous process of reconciliation, and held multiple meetings with village elders, panchayat members, and community leaders to ensure a peaceful homecoming, said Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi.\nAdding to the emotional significance of this return, the District Administration identified and revived the families’ ancestral land—approximately 8.5 hectares of once-barren terrain that had turned wild with neglect. “The land was cleared, leveled, and made cultivable again, symbolising a fresh start,” Mr. Sanghavi said.\nAs part of the rehabilitation plan, two houses have already been constructed, while the remaining 27 families will receive homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and with the support of social organisations, the Minister said.\nOn July 17, Mr. Sanghavi said that they would welcome the families back to Mota Pipodra in a ceremony. The event will include a prayer ritual and the symbolic sowing of seeds on their revitalised land—a gesture of renewal and prosperity. The Minister said he would also distribute educational kits, ration supplies, and discuss long-term rehabilitation plans with the families.\n“This is not just about bringing people back to their village; it is about healing old wounds and building a future of harmony,” said Mr. Sanghavi. “We believe no tribal family should be left displaced due to outdated customs. Development and dialogue will always triumph over discord.”\nFor the Kodarvi families, this homecoming is nothing short of a miracle—a chance to reclaim their roots, their land, and their dignity."

    "content": "The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) on Tuesday (July 15, 2025) gave in-principle approval for the rejuvenation and beautification of Ramannakunta Lake in New Bowenpally, marking a major step toward transforming the long-neglected water body into a vibrant recreational and ecological space. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has proposed a detailed plan for the lake’s revival, including desilting, bund strengthening, stone revetment, and the creation of amenities such as open gyms, children’s play areas, and a walking track.\n“The beautification of Ramannakunta Lake has been approved by the Board. We are now awaiting a No Objection Certificate from the Army since the lake falls under their jurisdiction. The project is intended not just to enhance the area’s livability but also to improve groundwater recharge and local biodiversity,” said Madhukar Naik, CEO of SCB.\nThe proposal is part of a wider slate of urban development initiatives discussed during Tuesday’s Board meeting, which saw deliberations on infrastructure, public health, and civic administration.\nThe board discussed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HMDA for infrastructure development in lieu of direct cash compensation for the Defence land.Instead of depositing ₹303.62 crore into the Consolidated Fund of India, the State Governmenthas proposed carrying out development works such as underground sewer upgrades, strengthening of the Picket and Hasmathpet nalas, and stormwater drain construction across various Cantonment wards. An escrow account, as mandated by the Ministry of Defence’s corrigendum dated July 8, will track expenditures and project milestones. HMDA will also be responsible for funding any cost overruns or shortfalls.\nOn the healthcare front, the Board is expected to finalise an MoU with Maxvision Eye Hospital to offer cashless eye treatment to SCB employees and their dependents. This step aligns with Central Government directives allowing treatment at CGHS-empanelled hospitals at CGHS rates, thereby eliminating the need for upfront payments by beneficiaries.\nThe SCB has approved the installation of open gym equipment across various residential colonies and parks under its jurisdiction. The initiative aims to improve public health infrastructure and promote fitness among residents. In line with this, the Board is also considering the approval of specific locations for the installation of the open gym equipment. A total of ten sites across different wards have been proposed, ensuring equitable access to fitness amenities in multiple neighbourhoods, added Mr. Madhukar Naik."

    "content": "The Kerala Home department has reportedly endorsed the then State Police Chief’s (SPC) reportwhich states that a sequence of preventable oversights on the part of the State law enforcement and certain sections of the temple management contributed to the widespread public dissatisfaction over the conduct of the iconic Thrissur Pooram ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.\nThe State Cabinet had ordered the then SPC Sheikh Darvesh Saheb to conduct a multi-tiered probe into the alleged Thrissur Pooram “disruption”. It brought the then Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, M. R. Ajith Kumar, who was the highest-ranking officer at the festival venue, under the investigation’s ambit.\nAccording to official sources, Home Secretary Biswanath Sinha “made a note recommending appropriate action” on the SPC’s report and forwarded it to the Cabinet. However, the officials said they were unsure whether the report pointedly blamed Mr. Ajith Kumar for the “policing flaws”.\nThe Thrissur Pooram “disruption” controversy rapidly acquired a political dimension during the heat of the Lok Sabha election campaign. The Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later faulted the State police for “botching” the festival.\nSubsequently, Revenue Minister K. Rajan, who is in charge of Thrissur district and was actively involved in the festival’s conduct, seemed to tacitly endorse the CPI’s accusation by stating that a top-ranking official in charge of the festival’s security, crowd control, fireworks, public safety, emergency response and traffic management did not respond to his urgent calls.\nLater, the Congress and the CPI alleged that the festival’s “disruption” had adversely impacted public opinion and paved the way for the BJP’s resounding win in the Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency. Both parties signalled a conspiracy allegedly involving a ranking officer and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leadership to bolster the BJP’s chances of bagging the Thrissur seat.\nAccording to officials, the SPC’s report blamed administrative, planning and law enforcement “blind spots” for the “brief discontinuance” of the festivities.\nThey said the SPC’s investigation possibly side-stepped the political controversies centred around the issue and focussed more on providing a roadmap for the festival’s smooth conduct.\nThe SPC also reportedly emphasised the need for stakeholders, including the Thiruvambady-Paramekkavu Devaswoms and the district administration, to reach a consensus on sensitive matters such as crowd control, road closures, vehicular and pedestrian traffic management, fireworks, and elephant processions, rather than making arbitrary and impromptu decisions that cause unnecessary friction."

    "content": "The Water Resources Department (WRD) will establish a separate wing, State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO), with a dedicated chief engineer for effective management of dam safety and implementation of various initiatives, including dam rehabilitation and improvement projects in Tamil Nadu.\nThe SDSO will be the 15thwing of the WRD, bifurcated from the Operation and Maintenance Wing, and would adhere to the Dam Safety Act, 2021. The State government recently issued an order, notifying the constitution of the SDSO headed by a chief engineer to adhere to the requirements of the Act and perform the functions specified by it.\nThe Act specifies that States with more than 30 dams must have an SDSO. Therefore, the formation of a wing was essential to prioritise the safety of dams that are several decades old. Tamil Nadu has nearly 128 dams, including 90 under the WRD and 38 under the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco).\nSources in the WRD said that the functions of the SDSO could not be effectively carried out due to the lack of a functional head. This wing would be a monitoring and advisory body, which would coordinate with the State Dam Safety Committee and National Dam Safety Authority. It would have 25-30 members with expertise in hydrology, dam hydro mechanics, and dam safety engineering.\nThe wing would perform various activities like inspection, vulnerability and hazard classification of the dams, recording dam failures and funds for maintenance and repairs. Moreover, some of the major tanks and water bodies would be brought under the dam category, warranting enhanced monitoring and special attention, sources said.\nBesides inspection of the dams once in five years, ongoing initiatives likeDRIP-II being carried out with World Bank assistancewould be expedited.\nThe new wing would also coordinate with National Dam Safety Authority on rapid risk assessment of dams to evaluate potential impact during dam failure."

I have a better idea for you. Why don’t you look at Andhra Pradesh instead? We have an attractive aerospace policy for you, with best-in-class incentives and over 8000 acres of ready-to-use land (just outside  Bengaluru)! Hope to see you soon to talk across the table.”\nHis father and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had earlier ruffled feathers in Karnataka by offering a 10,000-acre land parcel in Anantapur district to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for potential expansion.\nKarnataka’s Labour Minister Santosh Lad, meanwhile, assured that the State government will “find a solution” to the land acquisition issue. Speaking to news agency ANI, he said that the government has asked famers to voluntarily give their land and clarified that the project isn’t scrapped. “For the last five decades, we have been in the number one position in GDP. We will find a solution. The farmers had a strong opinion that this land should not be given to anyone else. We have asked farmers to voluntarily give us their land. It doesn’t mean the project is scrapped,” he said.\nThe Karnataka government had proposed acquiring 1,777 acres of land in Devanahalli taluk for an aerospace park. While the final notification for the project had been issued, Karnataka government dropped the process of land acquisition in 13 villages following resistance by farmers. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with representatives of farmers in Bengaluru on July 15, announced shelving of the land acquisition process.\nMr. Siddaramaiah made the announcement as the farmers’ protest entered the 1,198th day on July 15. However, he also said that the government would acquire property of those farmers who have volunteered to give up their land for the project, by offering higher prices and sops, like part of a developed land."

    "content": "The political temperature is rising in the Union Territory of Puducherry ahead of the 2026 Assembly election with the Opposition upping the ante against Bharatiya Janata Party and its ruling ally the All India N. R. Congress headed by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy following the contentious decision to replace the sole BJP Minister from the Scheduled Caste community with a party legislator who had come under the scanner of the High Court and the Puducherry police in a temple land grab case.\nRecently, the BJP high command had asked its Minister from the Dalit community A. K.Sai J. Saravanan Kumar to step down ostensibly as part of a prior understanding of sharing the Cabinet berth. Even as the move to remove the sole Dalit representative in the Cabinet triggered an outcry in the political circles, what has exacerbated matters is the choice of BJP legislator A. John Kumar, who had come under a cloud in a land grab case involving a prime property belonging to the famed Kamatchi Amman Temple in the heart of the city.\nThe issue being held against Mr. Kumar’s induction is a case the CB-CID wing of the Puducherry police had registered in 2023 in connection with the grabbing of around 64,000 sq. ft. of Kamatchi Amman temple land at Rainbow Nagar in the town. The police registered a case against several Revenue Officials for conniving with a business group to grab the land. During investigation, the role of some politicians had also surfaced.\nIn the meantime, on a petition filed by a devotee, the High Court had directed Mr. Kumar, his legislator son Richards John Kumar, also belonging to the BJP, and four of their family members to return the temple property to prove their bona fide in the wake of their claim of having been innocent purchasers who had no role to play in the allegations of fabrication of documents, corruption, and collusion with government officials to grab the temple land.\nThe Court had asked the government to take possession of the land and directed the two legislators to subject themselves to the criminal investigation undertaken by the CB-CID in Puducherry. Subsequently, the District Administration took possession of the land and handed over the property to the Kamatchi Amman Temple trust.\nThough the CB-CID had made several arrests, including two senior officers belonging to Pondicherry Civil Services, the probe agency has maintained a silence on the progress made in the case which invited criticism from the Opposition parties. The Enforcement Directorate had alsosuo moturegistered a case and sought details from the government about particulars of the case.\nThe case related to the temple land had started to hound Mr. Kumar ever since his name cropped up for the Ministerial berth to fill the vacancy, with the Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), vehemently opposing the decision of the BJP to include the Kamaraj Nagar constituency legislator in Mr. Rangasamy-led Cabinet. Opposition leaders have issued statements criticising the BJP for projecting an image of being “proponents of Hindutva while allowing people involved in temple land grabbing case to occupy Ministerial position.”\nApart from the Congress and the Left parties, the Hindu Munnani too has taken up cudgels against the BJP for inducting a partyman who was facing temple land grab charges. On the very day the Ministry of Home Affairs cleared the name of Mr. Kumar for being inducted into the Cabinet, around 75 Youth Congress workers sent letters to President Droupadi Murmu seeking her intervention in preventing Mr. Kumar from becoming a Minister as he and his family members were under the scanner in a case relating to usurping temple land.\nThe Hindu Munnani, which had been in the forefront of a campaign opposing the temple land grab, has come out in the open against the BJP local leadership for inducting a “scam-tainted” person in the Cabinet. Just hours before Lieutenant Governor K. Kailashnathan administered the oath of office to Mr. Kumar at Raj Nivas on Monday, several Hindu Munnani activists held a day-long protest in the town over giving the legislator a Cabinet berth.\nThe Hindu Munnani activists who participated in the protest vowed to intensify the agitation in the coming days. The cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also held a separate protest during the same time against the swearing-in of the BJP legislator.\nCiting the appointment of Mr. Kumar as a Minister, former Chief Minister and Congress veteran V. Narayanasamy at a press conference termed the Hindutva ideology stated by the BJP as “fake” and hinted at the Congress party’s plans to expose the BJP for giving a Ministerial berth to a person accused of grabbing temple land.\nAs the issue gets more traction in the political arena of the Union Territory, the BJP would have to redouble its efforts to convince followers that its legislator was an innocent victim who was duped into buying usurped temple land and that Mr. Kumar was offered a Ministerial post to honour a prior understanding to strengthen the outreach to Christian community in the former French enclave.\nAlong with the induction of Mr. Kumar into the Cabinet, another issue that has put the BJP in a tight spot and given the Opposition fresh ammunition against the ruling establishment ahead of the 2026 Assembly poll was the decision to replace Mr. Sai Saravanan. He was the lone Dalit member in Mr. Rangasamy’s Cabinet after the AINRC legislator, S. Chandira Priyanga, was removed from the Cabinet reportedly because the Chief Minister was not satisfied with her handling of subjects assigned to her.\nThe AINRC-BJP combine has come in for severe criticism from the Opposition ranks on the omission of a Scheduled Caste representative from the Cabinet. With the Opposition, particularly Congress, giving enough indication of keeping the issues of appointment of Mr. Kumar in the Ministry and lack of Dalit representation in the Cabinet, alive by organising a series of agitations against the ruling combine, it is unlikely that the political temperature will come down any time soon."

The brand, however, clarified in a reply to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce that the showcased sandals are still at the design stage and not yet confirmed for commercial production.\n“Four members of their technical team, including the heads of footwear design of Prada and two external consultants, visited Kolhapur on Tuesday (July 15, 2025). They toured the Kolhapuri chappal manufacturing cluster, observed the production process, and held discussions with local artisans,\" said Lalit Gandhi, president of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.\nHighlighting the craftsmanship involved, Mr. Gandhi said, “Our chappals are handmade and rooted in tradition. The team will now submit a report to its corporate office, and based on that, senior officials from Prada may visit Kolhapur in the next phase.” When asked about the possibility of collaboration, Mr. Gandhi said the visit itself was a positive sign. “The fact that Prada sent a technical team all the way to Kolhapur indicates serious interest. This is perhaps the first time a Prada delegation has come to Maharashtra,” he said.\nHe further said that Prada had created a product inspired by the Kolhapuri chappals. “Once we noticed the design on the runway, we raised an objection and asked them to acknowledge its origins. They responded to us via email, accepting that the theme was inspired by Kolhapuri chappals,” said Gandhi.\nLater on Tuesday, the visiting team also toured the retail market area in Kolhapur and interacted with shopkeepers."

Failure to file the reports in the next eight weeks will have consequences, the bench noted sternly.\nIn January 15,the court ruled that access to proper sanitationis recognised as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Issuing a slew of directions, it asked High Courts, State governments and UTs to ensure availability of separate toilet facilities for men, women, persons with disabilities and transgender persons in all court premises and tribunals.\nIt also asked for a status report within four months.\nOn Wednesday, the bench noted that only the High Courts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Calcutta, Delhi and Patna had filed affidavits giving details of actions taken to comply with the directions of the judgement.\nThere are 25 High Courts in the country.\n“Many High Courts are yet to file their affidavits/compliance report… we grant them the last opportunity to file the compliance reports within eight weeks. We make it clear that if they fail to file the status reports, then the registrar general of the High Courts will remain present personally in the court,” the bench ordered.\nIn its January 15 judgement, the court said the High Courts shall oversee and ensure that the facilities are clearly identifiable and accessible to judges, advocates, litigants and court staff.\n\"For the aforesaid purpose, a committee shall be constituted in each of the High Courts under the chairmanship of a Judge nominated by the Chief Justice and members comprising the Registrar General/Registrar of the High Court, the Chief Secretary, the PWD Secretary and the Finance Secretary of the State, a representative of the Bar Association and any other officers as they deem it fit...\"\nIt directed the committee to formulate a comprehensive plan and compile numbers on how many people visited the courts every day on an average and ensure that sufficient separate washrooms are built and maintained.\n\"The State Governments/UTs shall allocate sufficient funds for construction, maintenance and cleanliness of the toilet facilities within the court premises, which shall be periodically reviewed in consultation with the committee constituted by the High Courts. A status report shall be filed by all the High Courts and the States/UTs within a period of four months,\" the bench said.\nThe top court's judgement came on a PIL filed by advocate Rajeeb Kalita."

It helps ascertain if students are just beginning to use drugs or they are hooked on to it. This enables counsellors to make informed decisions about the referral services needed by students, whether it is counselling or medication to help them kick the drug habit.\nTeachers and parents too can use this screening test for a more effective response to the drug problem.\nThe counsellors say follow-ups will held them know if students are taking the medication required to wean them away from drugs or have resumed substance abuse.\nThey also stress the need for healthy family relationships for children’s well-being and keeping an eye on children, their rooms, and belongings to spot signs of drug abuse, if any, early and asking for help instead of trying to hide it."

People’s lives are more important than loan recovery,” he said.\nThe Minister said that none should act inhumanly during loan recovery.

I will also raise this with the Chief Minister,” he said.\nDeputy Commissioner Divya Prabhu G.R.J. said that all banks had been warned against adjusting any government aid or compensation towards farm loans. “A formal proposal in this regard had already been submitted to the State Bankers’ Committee and the government by the district administration,” she said.\nShe mentioned that, sometimes due to technical reasons, government funds might get credited to loan accounts, but the banks were now returning the funds to beneficiaries’ savings accounts.  The Deputy Commissioner said that as the issue was prevalent across the country, it required rectification at the government level."

    "content": "Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, officially known as Kanthapuram A. P. Aboobacker Musliyarand serving as the tenth Grand Mufti of India, has successfully facilitated the deferment of the execution of Indian nurse Nimisha Priya in Yemen. The intervention, built on his role as India’s highest Sunni religious authority and carried out through Islamic legal norms likediyāh(blood money), spotlights a rare instance of religious and diplomatic mediation in a foreign Sharia court.\nSheikh Abubakr Ahmad was elected Grand Mufti of India on February 24, 2019, by the All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam, a national body of Sunni clerics. Born as A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar in Kanthapuram, Kozhikode, Kerala, he has risen to national prominence through his decades-long leadership in Islamic education, social welfare, and public discourse. He is also the general secretary of the All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama and the Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama — two of India’s most influential Sunni Muslim organisations. His rise to the title of Grand Mufti, a largely symbolic but influential position, marked a historic moment as he became one of the few South Indian scholars to hold the post.\nAccording to his official website, Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad is the founder and chancellor of Markazu Saquafathi Sunniyya (Jamia Markaz), established in 1978 in Kerala. The institution has expanded to encompass a comprehensive network of educational centres, charitable organisations, and social service units. He has represented Indian Muslim scholars at international forums, including sessions at the United Nations and events organised by UNESCO. He is also a regular participant in global interfaith conferences. Through initiatives such as the International Peace Conference and Markaz-run educational programmes, he has been involved in activities focused on education, religious scholarship, and community welfare.\nThecase of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala, sentenced to death in Yemen for the 2017murder of Yemeni national Talal Abdo Mahdi, drew widespread attention in India. With the execution scheduled for July 16, 2025, urgent appeals were made by human rights activists and public representatives. Among them was Kerala Congress MLA Chandy Oommen, who approached Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, requesting his intervention to secure clemency under Islamic law. Recognising the urgency and humanitarian concern, the Grand Mufti reached out to prominent Yemeni Sufi scholar Sheikh Habib Umar bin Hafiz to explore the possibility of obtaining a pardon from the victim’s family under the Islamic concept ofdiyāh.\nAlso Read:Execution of Indian nurse in Yemen: Sunni leader Kanthapuram talks to Yemeni scholar in bid to save Nimisha Priya’s life\nYemen’s legal system, rooted in Islamic law, allows for the family of a murder victim to pardon the accused in exchange for financial compensation, ordiyāh. Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad utilised this principle in his appeal, stating that Islam encourages forgiveness and reconciliation. He emphasised to Yemeni religious leaders that “in Islam, there is another law where the victim’s family pardons the accused”. He suggested that this path be pursued in the case of Nimisha Priya. Through coordinated efforts involving Yemeni tribal leaders, judicial authorities, and religious scholars, her execution was temporarily deferred.\nThe most immediate outcome ofSheikh Abubakr Ahmad’s intervention has been the postponement of Nimisha Priya’s execution. The stay was granted after last-minute negotiations in Damar, Yemen, initiated through religious channels. Talks between the victim’s family and mediators, both religious and diplomatic, are ongoing. The hope now is to secure a full pardon through a formaldiyāhagreement, which could lead to Nimisha Priya ’s release from capital punishment.\nIn a final bid to save Nimisha Priya, Mr. Aboobacker Musliar has appealed to Mahdi’s family to pardon her. With her execution looming, Nimisha Priya’s fate now rests on the victim’s family’s willingness to accept $1 million indiyāh(blood money) and grant her clemency. Sources close to Mr. Aboobacker Musliar have been hopeful that Habib Omar’s respected status and influence in Yemeni society will help secure a favourable outcome for Nimisha.\nAddressing the media at Karanthur, near Kozhikode, on Tuesday (July 15, 2025), Mr. Aboobacker Musliar said that he successfully appealed to Yemeni scholars to intervene in Nimisha Priya’s case, considering the importance of saving a human life. “We have just received official confirmation from the Yemeni authorities that Nimisha Priya’s execution has been stayed based on our request. Let us all pray for her safe release,” he said."

    "content": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) began the final hearing on a writ petition filed for vacating the Tambaram Police Commissionerate from a rented building located on Semmozhi Salai in Sholinganallur and to hand over the vacant possession of the premises to its owners.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh heard the arguments advanced by senior counsel V. Raghavachari for the owners of the property, D.H. Sarath Kumar, D. Venkatesh, and D. Choudry, who had filed the writ petition, on Wednesday and decided to hear Advocate General P.S. Raman on Thursday (July 17).\nIn his submissions, the senior counsel said, the petitioners had rented out their property measuring 27,250 sq. ft. to the police commissionerate from January 2022 only on the basis of an assurance given by its first Commissioner M. Ravi to pay a monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh.\nAccordingly, a lease agreement was signed for three years between the property owners and an Additional Superintendent on behalf of the Commissionerate, agreeing for the monthly rent of ₹10.14 lakh for 11 months and to revise it periodically as per market value.\nHowever, the State government did not pay the rent for several months citing the objections raised by the Finance department and finally, it came out with an offer of a monthly rent of ₹6.33 lakh on the basis of an inspection carried out by a Public Works Department Executive Engineer.\nSince the petitioners were not agreeable to the offer made by the government, they insisted on vacating the property and handing over vacant possession but the Police department was continuing to occupy it, citing its strategic location and easy access to the public, the senior counsel said.\nFurther, stating that the petitioners had rented out only ground plus four floors to the commissionerate, he complained that the Police department had unauthorisedly put up constructions on the terrace too. He said, even the car parking area was not spared and as many as 45 cabins had been created over there.\nAfter turning the open car parking area too into an office, the Police department had put up car sheds on an adjacent piece of land, which had not been rented out to the commissionerate, and begun to park its cars over there. Such unauthorised use of the land had led to blocking the passage to the petitioners’ another property, he said.\n“It is the law enforcement machinery which is doing all this. I can’t go and complain to anybody but for this court. The Tambaram Commissionerate wasinaugurated by the Chief Minister himself. The owners are in deep distress. They have debts too. They want to sell this property after vacating the tenant,” the senior counsel added.\nAfter relying upon a judgment in support of his plea to direct the government and the police commissionerate to vacate the rented property, Mr. Raghavachari said: ‘”When the British ruled us, we were complaining about lack of rule of law. Now, we are ruling ourselves and still there is no rule of law.”"

Chinchurani announced the decision at a press conference here on Wednesday (July 16, 2025) after a high-level meetingamid rising cases of stray dog bites and deaths due to rabies.\nAs per Section 8 of the Animal Husbandry Rules, the euthanasia of an animal can be carried out when the Union government or the State government finds any animal which is so diseased that it can spread the disease, in order to control such disease. A registered veterinary practitioner has to certify that the animal is mortally injured or so severely injured or in such a physical condition that it shall be cruel to keep it alive.\nMr. Rajesh said the State government had to depend on the Animal Husbandry Rules for allowing euthanasia of diseased stray dogs as the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules do not allow euthanasia.\n“The State government will again request the Union government to amend the ABC rules as it slows down the progress of ABC activities. Another challenge is the opposition from the local population against opening ABC centres. The government will take action related to obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions against those who try to impede the functioning of ABC units,” he said.\nEight mobile ABC units, purchased by the Animal Husbandry department, will be deployed immediately. The Local Self-Government department will also over the next two months deploy mobile ABC units in each of the 152 block panchayats in the State. Panchayats have been directed to identify ideal locations to park the mobile units. The mobile units are meant to overcome the local opposition while setting up permanent ABC centres in various localities. Vaccination of stray dogs will be carried out in August. Licensing and vaccination of pet dogs will done in September."
